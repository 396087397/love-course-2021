# 朱利安ten game：4.任务​---更多课程微信156066050：任务 5

我活著， Before I laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，I'm not a sure，I just can't take my eyes。

Can't take my eyes off you， This is Julian， Welcome to Mission Number 5。

 Before we crack into this one here， A few things first， Number 1， This is usually around the time。

 that people start falling off， in terms of going out， and following the missions。

 If you scroll through the Facebook group， There are a lot of mission one post。

 There are a lot of mission two posts， Mission 3， A little bit less， And Mission 4， Even less。

 Okay so if this is you， If you identify with this， You're like oh fuck yeah， You know kind of。

 Kind of stagnated， I kind of gave up on the missions， First thing you want to do。

 Is watch the accountability teleconference， Okay I uploaded the replay here below。

 So scroll down and watch that， And do whatever you can， To just jump back out there。

 To get your ass out in the field， And number 2， Remember that these missions。

 Like they're not meant for you， To achieve perfection， Okay they're just meant to give you。

 A better sense of direction， Don't aim for perfection， Just focus on the direction。

 So you're not just dabbling while out， Okay if you go out for example， Say 7 days a week。

 So you miss a day， It's not the end of the world， You know I see a lot of posts。

 Where you know guys， Are just kind of beating themselves up， This is not what the missions。

 Are designed to be， Okay this is not another reason， For you to， Beat yourself up。

 And disapprove of yourself， It's just to give you some direction， While out， Okay so remember。

 Number 1 it's like really value the fun above all else， If the missions， Are killing that fun。

 Go back and you know， Like over the missions temporarily， Or don't aim for so much like perfection。

 Until you kind of get that fun vibe back， And then add the missions on top of that。

 Okay because if you're going out， And you're not having a blast。

 Yeah you're you're doing your 7 days a week， You're doing the assignments。

 But you're missing the whole point， That is game， Okay so that's the first thing。

 And the second is last week， Okay mission number 4， I asked you to post。

 Some screen caps of different text exchanges， Okay in terms of setting up a date。

 And I thought we could crack into three of them here， The first one。

 Okay this brings up some interesting points， The first one starts like this， Okay so。

 You got her number， And you text her your name， This is at 307 am， At 339。

 She texts you back a wink， Okay and then， There's pretty much nothing till the next day。

 If she texts you back a wink， At 339， Unless you committed to another girl。

 Unless you went home with another girl， Unless you had to go home early。

 Um that's the lead you want to be fucking calling。

 Like that's one of those numbers at the end of the night， So hey where you at， Let's hang out。

 After I was through， Let's go for fucking drink， Hey what's going on， Versus。

 Oh I'll just let it slide， Okay， What I usually do is again， I'll text the my name。

 Around halfway through the night， I'll be texting where are you。

 And yeah don't let the lead like that die， Okay so the next day。

 Um you still text her which is good， You're like hello， Are we still hanging out today。

 Her answer is no， I can't， It's like hi I can't， Uh next question is hey so when are you free。

 Now be careful with this one here， Like these open-handed like when are you free。

 Uh that'll rarely go somewhere， You want to be decisive， And precise with your text。

 It's like hey let's do this， At this time， This day， Versus， So when are you free， You know。

 Uh then， You know you wait a bit， And then you text her like， I hate you。

 Like immediately it's like， I hate you， It's like， Extremely reactive。

 Uh communicating and care way too much， Uh she's still engaged though， Her answer is um。

 Uh she's like why winky face， And then， You're your answer as well， Because your hair is too dark。

 Uh you eat too little meat， And you need 8 days 16 hours， And 29 minutes to respond to a message。

 Don't they seem you know like sufficient reasons， Now again the whole text thing。

 Like keeps on going， It doesn't kill it， But immediately， That's like。

 It's just like extremely try hard off the bat， The fact that you're counting the days。

 And hours and minutes， It's just such a big deal， Okay remember it's like， The frame mind。

 When texting is like， How would you text， If you're in a middle of an orgy with 10 models。

 Would you be like， Oh you was 8 minutes， Like you wouldn't care， Be like way more casual。

 Okay for a girl it's not a big deal， If you make it into a big deal， It seems like。

 You know one you're lower value， And number two， It could put a lot of pressure on her too。

 To kind of live up to the date， Because it's like so important for you， So more casual。

 Also don't expect a girl to be free， The first time you suggest hanging out， Um you know。

 Especially here it's like， You text her out one， She was out till， You know like 340 here。

 So probably to like 4 or 5am， You're like hey we're still hanging out， She's probably tired of just。

 Fuck at that time， She answers， Um hey I can't， Okay so， Something to keep in mind。

 Then you keep texting here， There's um， Some back and forth， You text her some pictures。

 You text some videos back and forth， She's still engaged which is good。

 It's kind of showing your personality， But um， The uh， You don't want to fall into like that frame。

 Where you're like now， Her little texting buddy， You know， It's like kind of going back and forth。

 Guys will do this， Where， Like you can start texting， And now your friends over text， But。

 You never hang out in person， Cause you don't want to ruin that， Texting buddy vibe。

 Like what if it's awkward， If we meet in person， And it just doesn't really move it forward， Um， So。

 Yeah， You know， It's like you're still texting her， It's like hey what are you doing tomorrow night。

 So that's good， Hey let's drinks tomorrow， Uh， You know maybe try like。

 I'd say calling her first of all， Like versus these little videos back and forth， And uh。

 You know maybe try something else， Then you know let's hang out， Or let's drink， Like。

 Have like a more precise plan， Like switch it up a bit， Don't just repeat it over and over。

 You know， It's like hey， I'm doing this， You should come， Hey what about this， Or hey。

 I'm in the area， Like make it easy on her， That's another one too， It's like for the date。

 Make it easy， You have her logistics， You know what area she lives in， Be like。

 Hey I'm in this place， Uh， What are you doing， You know， Call her， Now it's not like。

 Oh there's this big deal， There's this huge date， It's probably just stuff to walk out。

 And you said， You know， A bar or a nearby， Or doing something nearby， Uh， So that's the first one。

 Well， This is a short one， The first text is， Um， Are you and your bike busy tonight。

 So I'm most likely call back to humor in the text， Um， You know， That's good。

 Again there's a purpose， It's like hey， Are you busy tonight， Uh， Her answer， She's like， Uh， Uh。

 Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh。

 Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh， Uh，不放遍。

二 week rest period last week， and this week next week， we're gonna jump back in the seven days。。

 So over this week your mission， is you have to go out twice，， okay， only twice。， However。

 for one hour minimum， and last week it was at night， in a bar club this week it's during the day。。

 Okay， so twice this week，， one hour minimum during the day， and the goal here is to get used。

 to these longer interactions。， Okay， in order to really get consistent results。

 while out you need to have those，， you know， 45 minutes to an hour and a half sets。

 and if your interaction is just like five， 10 minutes， and nothing's gonna happen。。

 Now you can practice this while out obviously， in a bar club，。

 but during the day you can kind of ease your way there。， You know。

 it's like there's probably gonna be， a lot of girls like sitting out， you know。

 in fucking summertime， like sitting out on a， you know，， at a little restaurants， on a patio。

 a coffee shop， and it's easy to kind of just sit down， and start chatting。

 or if you meet a girl's walk， and it's not really doing anything， just instant day turns。， Okay。

 let's go for fucking coffee。， And now you're sitting there， and now you have a good like，， oh， 20。

 30 minute chunk or longer ideally， where you can spend time and get used to these，。

 get build that endurance and set。， So your goal here is to focus on longer sets。

 then of course that'll translate， while out to those 45 minute hour and a half， in a bar club，。

 but the minimum here is try to get a 20 minute， interaction minimum。， Okay。

 so let's go out twice for one hour， each time minimum ideally longer。

 and get one set that's at least 20 minutes。， Okay， resist， leaving， resist， ejecting，。

 like get that 20 minute set，， build that endurance， no matter what。， Okay。

 the other thing I want you to do， is to post your biggest lesson slash epiphany。

 from reading the way of the superior man， would really resonate with you， what you got out of it。。

 And the last thing and this to make it a little bit fun，， I want you to do three，。

 quote unquote awkward slash social pressure， Starbucks or coffee shop opens。， Okay。

 where you're basically gonna go into a Starbucks， or any coffee shop， it doesn't matter。。

 It doesn't have to be Starbucks。， It's like kind of that scary situation。

 we all think of when it comes during the day，， like， oh， if I open a girl in line，。

 everyone's gonna fucking hear，， that's what I want you to do。， So you're gonna go into Starbucks。

 one of those kind of hectic crazy situations， and I want you to open a girl in line。

 or a girl seated at a table，， loud so people can fucking hear。， Okay， I want that social pressure。

 when you get used to it， and your opener is， excuse me， did it hurt？， You wait for answers。

 you'll probably be like，， what？， What the fuck was this guy talking about？。

 And then you continue when you fell out of heaven， or when you fell from heaven。， That's your open。

 like the cheesiest fucking pick of line，， like， excuse me， did it hurt？， When you fell from heaven。。

 And I want you to say， loud enough，， so everyone's like， what the fuck？。

 I want people to kind of laugh，， people like， what the fuck is this guy。

 just open with the cheesiest line？， Ideally， you should laugh at it too。

 and this will one get you again，， desensitize to these like more scary situations。

 learn to have fun in them， and to get used to that social pressure。， Okay， so that's the mission。。

 Two days this week， okay，， an hour minimum each time during the day。， Number two。

 focus on a long set。， You need a 20 minute set minimum。， Number three， post your biggest lesson。

 or epiphany from the way of the superior man。， And number four， do three， awkward Starbucks opens。。

 Good luck。。
