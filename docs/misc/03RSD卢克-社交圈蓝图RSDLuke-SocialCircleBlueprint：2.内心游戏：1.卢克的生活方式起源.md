# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：2. 内心游戏：1.卢克的生活方式起源

我回到velgas，所以 我真的太害怕到了，在 luggage master，這個街頭到 Евgas特有了，所以這通話是我叫我，那邊當主人，我聽到你很近的地方，以下，要跟著我，有在工作那些人。

只能玩劇棉，證明的遊戲，就是完全改變天，就是把創造我們，段接了，我聽見了大牛，就是這個車時的思考，也明說，嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 大家去品嘗。

嗯 und it was not even a growth on that town， it was called the village of Elk Mountain。

 actually grew up about 13 minutes outside that，嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 呐 嗯，呐 还有鞋中的事。

嗯 it was a dairy farm where you milk the cows and， solve manure and all this crazy shit， right。

 so I love that there was one clap for shovel manure，嗯 the clothes thing I saw to it。

 it was you know I ride， I'd read like Maximerves e guitar， the different periodicals， I'd see on TV。

 people having a lot more fun， the type of fun that I wanted to live， so for me，我等等，我本身沒關係，但是一下。

我反正就是，我不懂，我是，為什麼這樣，當我想出一下，我直接收拾了，跟第二位，大家當初，收拾的，因為我本身，比較好，應該是，我只是，可能 claim，整個的工作，我也不知道，深遠都説的，和梵的話，神嗎。

就大我們，駖進了，魚，路山，宇航， flooded，一 500 天，一天，在 r，城市，一共一 80，二條，尖銷，一頓，一山，二山，ately，二條。

我真的 never even thought that social circle game， or a cold approach pick up， or anything specifically。

 was gonna be my path to having the success I wanted。， I just knew that I wasn't achieving it。

 and I wanted to go for it。， So what I immediately started doing， was finding role models。。

 Modeling is a huge， huge technique that you can use， to identify people who are having success。

 in an area that you want to have success in， and then adapt and improve to that way。。

 I knew that there's definitely certain things， that guys that I knew were having success in。

 and I didn't really care if I was going to follow them。

 in a way that was gonna achieve certain love success， and other parts of my life or not。。

 I didn't really care if I even adapted some of the traits， that weren't as positive in those guys。。

 I just knew that there's certain guys， that were making the kind of money I wanted to make，。

 certain guys that were hooking up with the kind of girls。

 I would hook up with and making the kind of male， relationships that I wanted to make as well。。

 I read a bunch of like Maximegazines， and other things like that when I was a kid。

 and I realized that there was other guys， achieving the lifestyle that I wanted。， It just wasn't me。

， And I knew I was a little bit ahead of the curve， at the time too because I was 14， 15。

 16 at the time。， I didn't find game until I was 20 but 14， 15， 16，。

 I realized that there's all these different movements。

 out there of guys trying to become nightclub promoters，， guys trying to be entrepreneurs，。

 guys trying to want to have a lot more success， that they're currently having。

 and being happy and content，， they didn't really care as much about。

 compared to achieving a lot of success。， So for me， that's exactly where I identified with。。

 So I basically researched as many types of guys， in different cities that were having success。

 whether it was nightclub promoters，， restaurant owners， entrepreneurs，。

 and I decided to just model my entire life after them。。

 And I decided to take up every habit that they had， whether it was clothing。

 whether it was business related，， whether it was friendship related， nightclub related，。

 whatever it was， I would just embody all those traits， and I would just tackle it and go forward。

 without really any sort of hesitation。， Even if it meant that I would change who I was quite a bit。。

 I find a lot of guys don't want to change who they are，， they want to keep being themselves。

 but then they want different results。， I didn't really care about my identity。

 or who I was at the time， because I knew I just wanted to keep breaking out of that。

 and I knew that all I really wanted， was a certain specific type of result。。

 And that was a lot of beautiful women in my life，。

 a lot of cool guy friends that I could either mentor。

 or get mentored by and then achieve a certain level。

 of success each year and let that grow and grow and grow。。

 And then what ended up happening is the founder， of the tech company that I was recruiting to work for。

 when I was 20， he actually knew， all the big pickup artists，， he knew all the big dating coaches，。

 he really kind of mentored me， and kind of introduced me into what is game。

 and all this whole community type stuff， right？， And this was before the TV show，。

 this was before way before the stuff got famous on YouTube， and about a month later。

 I basically told them， that I wanted to pursue this， and I just kind of left my tech career。

 and my software development job， right？， And I was like， this is really what I want to do。。

 So immediately I knew that I didn't exactly know， which specific guy was going to be able to help me achieve this。

 but I did know that I would see guys， that would have the type of results that I wanted。。

 So I made it my life's mission basically， to find as many naturals， to find as many pickup artists，。

 to find as many guys who are having the type of success， that I was after， do as much as I could。

 to model what I was doing after them， and then achieve that kind of level of success。。

 So that really was a eight year journey，， nine year journey in just modeling。

 everything I was doing after them， and I basically spent about six months。

 with a couple guys specifically in different cities，， model exactly what they were doing。

 and look at the results， examine the progress， that I had made and then keep what I liked。

 and ditch what I didn't like。， And what I kept coming back to， is this concept of social proof。

 that is a really， it's a very old pickup concept， but it's something that some guys really dabble with。

 but they don't really run with to the degree， that I saw that I could run with it。。

 Social proof kept coming around， in every single guy that I would meet。

 in the main consistent factor， that would bring high status guys into his life。

 and really attractive women over and over again。， Social proof would always really win over everything else。

， Social proof is essentially the concept of having， a lot of high status people in your life。

 that respect you look up to you， and are really willing to be around you。。

 It goes a little bit further into pre-selection， that means having a lot of women。

 that admire you look up to you， and want to spend time with you。。

 So social proof for me really was the answer to everything。， It's why I used to have this quote。

 which is Vegas fixes everything， and every time I would travel with city。

 or I would date girls in DC or Toronto or New York， or whatever it was。。

 I remember I was Danesville and Dallas， and a lot of cool guy friends and Dallas。。

 So my best wings are in Dallas。， So one of the most underrated games， that he's that there is。。

 And I remember I was going through， like some emotional or personal stuff。

 and I just remember what you know， at Vegas fixes everything。

 and I kind of would keep her coming back to Vegas， and I was wondering why Vegas。

 just kept fixing things for me。， And I realized there's just such an immense amount。

 of social proof and social capital in Vegas， that it really solved a lot of my problems。。

 And I started taking that down， breaking that down。

 and then basically taking those exact same traits，， putting them into other cities。

 and into friends of my lives and clients of my lives。。

 And I would show them exactly how to take that social proof， and inject it in their life。。

 It would really just fix a lot of things。， A lot of the mindset shifts that a lot of guys talk about。

， A lot of the abundant mentality，， a lot of the entitlement， a lot of these other things。

 take a lot longer to solve， if you just look yourself in the mirror。

 and try to solve these problems individually。， But if you cure them with social proof。

 and you kind of flank the issue， with creating a high status lifestyle for yourself。

 all of a sudden what you realize is， your core confidence really goes through the roof。

 and you don't have to do as much game， and you have to do as much personal development。

 you just kind of embody those traits inadvertently， accidentally。。

 So I really kind of developed a quest， to get as much social proof as possible。。

 I decided to really tackle， all the different types of guides that have social proof。。

 Whether that was nightclub promoters， celebrities，， social media celebrities，。

 females that have a lot of social proof，， guys that are entrepreneurs。

 that somehow just have social proof，， guys who accidentally have social proof。

 pick a bar to say social proof。， And I just took every single thing。

 and I saw that they were doing it， put it in my own life。

 and then I also tested how duplicatable it was，， how much could I show somebody else how to do that？

， And then this is in cities like San Francisco， New York，， and even in LA， Dallas， different cities。

 that weren't even as wild and crazy as Las Vegas。， And the techniques that I came up with。

 were really techniques how to get as many high status people。

 in your life so that you became high status yourself。， And that's really what I've formed。

 and that's the basis of really what I'm doing。， What you want to understand is the more high status。

 that you can make yourself，， the more social proof that you can create around yourself，。

 the more fulfilled you are，， the happier your game really becomes，， well you having to try to do it。

， I spent a little bit over a year， purely working on inner game several years ago。

 and I was basically with a lot of other people， that were， you know。

 we're all trying to drink the Kool-Aid， and just really good fulfillment。

 just off of inner game alone。， And what I realized is that the more that I did that，。

 the more that I just kind of created this facade， of happiness， facade of confidence around myself。。

 The only real way that I created true fulfillment， within myself is creating this social proof。

 because I was the only way that I could really create， this type of consistent results。

 that wasn't very shakeable，， this consistent level results that didn't really，。

 they didn't really fall short，， that I was able to just kind of keep powering through with it。， The。

 as they've been here to actually build， any sort of social circle game or social proof in LA，。

 besides Hansel， what do you do？， I would get social proof of like，， I don't know a couple of times。

 that are promoters that like hide， and boot see or what they're saying。， Cool。。

 It's cool because I'm around a lot of like，， hide-out you people，， I'm able to like，。

 bring them to say like tomorrow， and just like learn from them。， Yeah。

 who in here goes to hide and boot see？， Raise your hand really high。， Boot see， raise your hand，。

 who goes to hide and boot see？， Besides him and her。， Raise your hand， hide or boot see，。

 raise your hand， or warwick。， Or hide boots see，， there you go， besides the fans， there you go。。

 Hide boots see warwick or，， what's that？， Or nice guy， raise your hand。， Yeah， yeah。， So。

 what's that？， Yeah， or one oak。， Yeah， those spots right there。， Raise your hand。， Raise your hand。。

 Okay， raise your hand if you've never even heard， of these places at all， period。， Cool。， Yeah。。

 So here's the thing， right？， Cool， you can bring your hand out。。

 So that mean that alone is the scrap， whatever else I was gonna talk about。。

 And now I'm gonna talk about it。， And now this is what we need to address。。

 Just throw that right out， right？， Here's the thing， if you，， let's start with square one。。

 Whatever game topic you learn or address，， and you don't know what those five。

 establishments are in the city of Los Angeles，， nothing else matters， period。。

 It just doesn't matter。， There's no other place that's going to be valuable。

 to get you the kind of results you're after。， Whether you like tall girls， short girls，。

 nightclub girls， non-nightclub girls，， sluts， saints or sinners，， this doesn't really matter， right？

， Innocent girls， whatever you like，， that you have to know at least the venues。

 that you're supposed to be able to go to， right？， That would be cold approach and social circle game 101。

， Okay？， But how do you actually know what those places are？， You can't really，， let's tell you what。

 you can't really go on Yelp， and look up the best type of nightclub。。

 Usually the types of clubs are the best in each city。， My favorite club in New York， for example，。

 has like 15，000， like one star，， or like even less than one star， like radians。， It's kind of funny。

， It's because it's the meanest door， or whatever it might be， right？。

 So they have some of the nastiest radians and reviews。， So how do you actually find that， right？。

 Well， you have to go up to people that are，， you have to go up to，。

 what I like to do is find exactly the type of girl that I like。

 and look at whatever guy is standing next to her，， and then literally make friends with that guy，。

 like genuine friendship with him，， because he knows exactly what he needs to be doing。

 in order to get that type of girl into his life。， So he's gonna have other guy friends I want to associate with。

 and he's gonna know how to get those kinds of girls， into his life。。

 So you take a club like one oak， for example， right？， It's about the worst nightclub in Las Vegas。。

 But it's the best nightclub in New York and LA， in my opinion。， So， well。

 how do you really know those kinds of things？， You only know those kinds of things by associating with people。

 and role modeling yourself after guys that you want to be like， and that you want to become。。

 The quickest way I've ever gotten a result in any part of my life。

 is taking a guy that I want to be like，， role model， take all the decisions that he's doing。

 and make those same decisions， have suspension of disbelief，。

 even if I think that a certain thing that he's doing isn't cool，。

 I'm still gonna do all those things， and then escalate myself forward and have success that way。。

 So if you're not going to the place that he just mentioned，。

 there's no other pickup concept in the world that's gonna help you。

 if you're not going to at least those places。， I have people that show up to the parties for the。。。。

 I guess the important people that show up there。， I'm wondering also some other names of places。

 you can go around in LA， some clubs。， Yeah， so like karma is a party organization， right？。

 So Nick Owens co-founder， Papa， he used to be involved in Xenie，。

 which is kind of a karma before karma， right？， I mean every karma party you should go to。

 and you should hack it， you should find your ways。

 to be able to network your way into these parties。， Okay？ Start with the night clubs。

 where the people who are going to those kinds of parties， are just attending regularly anyway。。

 Start with Babes in Toiland。， Babes in Toiland， you can go to。。。。

 You guys notice the tractivists of the girls in some of my videos？， Babes in Toiland。。

 Babes in Toiland。 You guys ever notice how attractive those girls are？， If not。

 take a look at my videos。， I mean most of the videos， most of the girls in my videos。

 are you can't find it at a local micro or local bar， because the videos were taken in events。

 like what we're just describing here。， The Babes in Toiland。 Babes in Toiland， not and toiland。

 right？， Babes in Toiland。 You can literally get into it。

 for buying a toy and don't need it to charity， while you're at the event。， Right？ I mean， yeah。

 exactly。 You feel good about it at the same time。， Warwick， warwick。， You know what？。

 Just Google it。 It will correct it for you。 What's that？， I'll just put them on the inner circle。。

 That way， maybe you can get on the inner circle， without sucking anyone's dick。， So， yeah。

 I'll make a post on the inner circle about it。， Yeah。 I mean， in LA， at least once or twice a month。

 and I go to all these venues myself。， So， the second I start changing which venues I go to，。

 those are the ones that you should be going to as well。

 because we're all kind of going after the same goal， right？， There's only four or five night clubs。

 that I would ever walk into in Los Angeles。， The rest are just rubbish。 There's just garbage。。

 There's just no point。 Right？， It's not a nightclub city。 Right？。

 It used to be when Crest and LaDue were around，， this was a nightclub city， but it's not anymore。。

 You'd be better off going to Katana or some high-end city。。

 I don't even know if that plays out anymore。， You could really like， really high-end like，。

 was that？， Katana or some high-end restaurant。， Like， nice guy， for example。 Right？。

 Lower hardware for a long time was the best place to meet girls。。

 It'd be better off going to something like that， rather than some nightclub。

 because it's just not really a nightclub kind of place， right？， You had your hand up。

 What did you say？， I was going to ask you to switch to a close place。， Yeah。

 just check out the inner circle。， I'm going to add it within 24 hours。

 I'll add it to the inner circle。， Next up， the play。， Okay， so how did you get into those places？。

 How did you meet those people that are promoters there？， Because he's like， once you identify，。

 and I'm going to give my examples on how I did as well。。

 I have a lot of videos about how I did this。， You know， I was just in，。

 I just did a four-day thing in New York。， So it was supposed to be three days。

 We stayed there for like six days。， I did this whole thing in New York on how I，。

 each night we'd go out and I would talk my way into a nightclub， without any social proof。

 without any sort of pretense of me knowing anybody there。。

 I would just take my film guy and we would just walk into nightclubs。

 and I would just talk my way in。， And I talked my way into almost every single one of them except for one。

， which is the one that actually had the most social proof that I just wasn't，。

 I told myself I had a rule I wasn't going to actually use any of my pre-selection。

 or social proofs to get in the club。， And I recorded the whole thing of what I said verbally to get into all these nightclubs。

， And I didn't dress that sharp。 I was just， was very humble about the whole thing。。

 Just to show you guys how easy it is to just talk your way into any nightclub， or any setting。

 Like it's really not that complex。， As guys make a lot more complex than it actually needs to be。。

 But if you focus on high-barried entry game，， you're going to have a lot more success。。

 High-barried entry game is you take the thing that's the hardest thing to do。， For example。

 a nightclub is the hardest nightclub to get into。， Once you can talk your way into that nightclub，。

 the game becomes extremely easy。， Because every girl knows what you had to do to get into that nightclub。

， She knows that it was a more difficult place to get into。。

 It's very easy to game girls and build commonalities with people at a very high-end event。。

 Like one of the karma parties， for example。， Every girl is extremely friendly。。

 I was supposed to be in Jamaica this past week at a think-all paradise challenge。

 with like 50 to 75 naked models。， They're all 9s or 10s。， A bunch of videographers。。

 If you follow my buddy， I'm Michael Sartain on Snapchat。。

 His entire Snapchat this week has just been these naked girls。。

 I've had to film this product and come talk to you guys。， So this is more fun。。

 But once you find that out， for example，， I sent a couple of students。

 Vegas and Urgent students down there with these girls in Jamaica。。

 He's messaging me these snapshots of every single girl being super nice to him。， Every single girl。

 a 100% number close ratio， 50% kiss-close ratio。， They're hook it up with these girls left and right。

， Because just the high-barried entry of him being able to knock those walls down。

 and be able to associate with these people， that makes the game that much easier。。

 So when you're actually at 1-0 here with Bootsy Bello for example or Warwick，。

 they're all extremely nice to you。， It's not lonely at the top。。

 It's actually extremely nice at the top。， The further up you go。

 I feel like I'll say it to every single sentence I say。， It's awesome。。

 I need a machine to just say， wow， after everything I do。， That's awesome。， Yeah。。

 That's better than Modepno。， So essentially the thing is this。， The first time I ever got into Oak。

 I was in New York。， It was very confusing。， I was like。

 this is no way it's always going to be like this。。

 The first time I ever went to Oak was in New York City on a Thursday。， And it was a Sunday。。

 It was a Sunday night Oak Party。， And every night， on Sunday， every single table is there。。

 It's all free for the people that have them。， And it's all models who are 5-11 taller。。

 It's like a very typical New York has a very judgmental height thing against girls。。

 I don't really give a shit。 But it's like everywhere you go， you're like looking up。。

 And it's all just 5-11 are about like models everywhere。， Models aren't like famous models。。

 They're all girls that are like trying to become models。。

 And there's a couple of things about that that are kind of the cause of that。。

 Because every promoter and a city like that， they just they bring five to ten girls that are models to the nightclub。

， And they get these free tables。， Well， if you just know that。

 it suddenly gets a lot less intimidating。， Now suddenly you're not walking in the night。。

 Like I see guys getting scared when they walk into a club like one Oak。。

 And they're just intimidating。， And they're just confused because they see all these pretty girls。。

 They see all these guys。 And they're just kind of trying to go up and cold approach these random girls。

， No girl at any of those tables will go home with a guy from a cold approach。。

 Because they all live together。 And they usually live with that promoter。。

 It's called a model house。， Right？， I don't know how quite as many as New York does。。

 But 100% of those girls cannot be cold approached because they're all living together。。

 They would lose their potential income。 They would lose like where they're staying。。

 They would lose their friendships。， Like there's just too much opportunity cost to then just leave with some random guy from that social setting。

， And the prettiest girls that are there， the most high-value， high-status girls that are there。

 are all a part of this group。， So it's just almost impossible in that kind of setting。。

 But then once I got ushered to one of these promoter tables， I just sat there the whole night。。

 Everyone comes up to me and they're like， oh， who are you？ What's your name？， Do you want to drink？

 Do you want to meet this other person？， I was just like， yeah， sure。 I guess。 Okay。。

 And I didn't really do anything special。， But all of a sudden。

 my night's going so much better than any other night that I had just cold approached。， Right？ Hey。

 what's up， bud？， Good to see you。， My night was just going a lot better than if I had just cold approached any of them individually。

， So for you， how did you find out that those are the spots and how did you meet those people？。

 It was like once you kind of like one guy that keeps you going。

 then you sort of like got a high-value。， And you sort of like， got a high-value。

 And you sort of went once you go to the portal and that was like。。。， For a month， the motor。

 he's like being an survivor of an element。， One of the owners pieed without me having him and then he has other nights in other places。

， And these other families have other nights to do the same thing。， Exactly。

 So what essentially what he said is once you meet one person。

 then you'll just start meeting and being introduced to every other one。。

 I basically call it getting taken under their wing game。， Right？ What ends up happening is。。。。

 And this happens to me on a daily basis。， Right？ Just get taken under the wing of somebody else。。

 And I really don't have to do anything。 I have a couple of business connections that I just got taken under the wing of。

， You know， I have this retail store in Vegas， this makeup store。。

 I have no idea what I'm doing with any of it。 I just。。。 I'm taking along all these meetings。。

 I just get to learn from this guy for the past two years now。。

 Maybe one day I'll have my own business in that kind of industry。， But I just。。。

 I'm just learning from it。 When it comes to nightlife， I met one guy in Vegas。

 his name is Lamborghini Alex。， He doesn't actually set foot in any nightclubs。

 He won't ever go into them， but he knows everybody everywhere。。

 I met him because he pulled up in a yellow Lamborghini outside the Win Hotel。。

 This was my first year in Vegas， I think， maybe seven years ago。。

 And he had the most beautiful Hispanic girl walked out of the passenger seat。。

 And I saw him like tipping her pain in the valley。。

 And I told my buddy that we have like 30 seconds to talk to this girl before he sees what's happening。

， So I just went up and talked to her， failed miserably。。

 And then he basically thought it was kind of funny what I was doing。。

 They walked into the Win Hotel。 I bumped them a few hours later at Rhino， strip club in Vegas。。

 And I saw him and then he basically called me out。， He's like， hey。

 you were that guy that was hitting on my girl。 I was like， yeah， I am。， What's up？ And he was like。。

。 He was like。。。， He was like， you want to do a shot or whatever。。

 And at the time I wasn't drinking anything and he was drinking a bunch。。

 And then in recent years we've switched。 So it was kind of funny。。

 He went all like Feng Shui and like， now he doesn't drink at all。， And before he did。

 it was kind of funny。， But basically the whole introduction happened because I was hitting on this dude's girl。

 who had a lot of access in Vegas。， And that kind of。。。 I really didn't meet any other people。。

 I just drove through his network。， What ended up happening is I said， hey。

 can you get me into excess？， And he's like， sure， I'll get you to excess。 No big deal。。

 And it was kind of an odd occurrence。 It was an odd occasion。， I just realized， hey。

 if I just collect this guy， if I just bond with this guy，。

 something good is going to happen from it。， So he said， yeah， here， let me introduce you to the guy。

， In terms of the general manager of excess at the time。， And the guy immediately sat me down at a。。。

 it's called Table 6， right？， So at nightclubs， each table has a number。。

 So you should get to the point where you have these escalating goals， right？。

 Where the girls you really want to talk to， they're not on the dance floor。。

 Anybody asked me about dance floor game？， I don't know。

 There was actually a guy in LA who was really good at teaching dance floor game。， It's just for me。

 it's like the dance floor or the bar or the hallway。。

 I just ignore all of it because there's maybe five tables in any nightclub that has girls that I actually talk to。

， But anywhere else is just this kind of general no man's land。。

 So what I show you guys is how to actually get to those exact spots，， how to get to those tables。

 how to know the really the topography of the nightclub。， If cities like Vegas and Miami。

 I give all my guys maps of each club。， So you can actually see which table number it is。。

 So when you go and talk to the staff， you can say， oh， I'm at table 7， I'm at table 8。。

 And then they'll see that and they'll just walk you right to that table。， Right？

 Each club has an owner's table， each club has a promoter's table，。

 where it's kind of a generic random table that nobody really cares if you're there。。

 It's just unlimited free alcohol。 It's just unlimited people just coming through there and networking。

， And just who are just kind of in what's called the industry。， I'm not really in the industry。

 I kind of work in nightclubs。， I technically work in nightclubs。 I just don't work at nightclubs。。

 So it's one of these things where I'm just， as long as you don't cause a problem，。

 I have these drills and how to get guys going to tables， for example。。

 One of those involves taking the bottle of alcohol that's at their table，。

 having somebody else take a photo and then you pouring the alcohol in the people's mouths at the table。

， Well， it's very easy to do that when you're not actually trying to take anything yourself。。

 If you're coming up and trying to take a drink， if you're coming up and trying to hit on their girls right off the bat。

 or cold approach their girls， suddenly their walls come up and they get very defensive。。

 But if you just meet one guy at each venue that you want to go to，。

 and that guy takes you under his wing， he's going to introduce you to everybody。。

 It's shockingly easy when you meet that one guy。， And all of a sudden you start seeing how many introductions that that guy is giving you to all of these people。

， And when you have to understand is， a lot of people have this fake abundant mentality。。

 It's so easy to look yourself in the mirror， give yourself all these positive affirmations，。

 but then actually have no girls around you。， It's very easy to tell yourself that you're a certain level of confidence。

 but then not actually have it。， What's challenging or what people think is challenging is to actually have those girls around you。

， But if you meet one guy that actually does have an abundant mentality，。

 one guy who actually does work at a nightlife establishment，。

 one guy who does work at the clubs we just mentioned。

 what he's going to do is he already has all the girls that he needs。， He's got too many。。

 He'd rather meet some guy that's not going to be a weirdo and then bond with that guy all night。。

 One of my best friends in LA is an Ikeloop promoter here。， I threw a party。

 I had like six hours to throw this event at Owen's old house。， And I remember I was like six hours。

 it was like an hour before we came to LA。， I took some of my Vegas immersion guys here。。

 I used to use these like once a month social circle parties in LA for my Vegas guys。。

 And I remember I was like， all right， fuck it。， Let me see how many people I can get to this party。。

 I texted one guy and at 230， 80 girls showed up and 15 guys showed up。， And I videied most of it。。

 I made one text， he texted me back。， I think I just responded one or two more times and then that's all the work I did for this event。

， Because he wanted to set this up and he only made a few texts himself。， But it wasn't a lot。。

 I didn't want to have to go out and like go promote and recruit for this party。。

 I don't want to put in all that effort or all that work。。

 I just knew the one guy that was able to do it。， This one guy， I mean him shared a few jokes。

 we shared a few drinks together。， And then he wanted to do all of the rest。。

 We guys have to realize this game is so much easier than you walking up and randomly putting all this work yourself。

， It's a lot easier than that because the guys that were intimidated by the guys that are the high school quarterbacks。

， Those guys are now these nightclub hosts that want to actually help you。， They're the。

 these restaurant managers that want to help you。， The best place right now to pick up girls is Taka Madero。

， Toka Madero， you guys know where this place is？， What is it？， Toka Madero。， Toka Madero， yeah。。

 BuddyMine uploaded a photo from there with like 30 super super Instagram models。。

 And it was just like yeah， casual Tuesday night out。， It was just a made it。。

 It's like little taco shop， right？， It's not anything that special。。

 Any one of you can just walk into this place。， There's no line to get there。。

 But if the girls I was seeing in this thing are famous video music video girls。， They're in the。

 like the girl from the G easy video was there。， She's the best friend of a friend of mine。， The。

 the brunette there。， She works at Warwick。， She， she was there like all her girlfriends were there and it's just like a little taco shop。

， Well， why are you out， like why are you gaming on the beach when these girls are in。

 these little pockets of places that you guys can go talk to？， And also this guy。

 like the guy that I know， he gave me free tickets to EDC。。

 And he gives me a friend of mine clients in Vegas， immersion， they all get free EDC tickets。。

 If they attend that month because this guy just loves pickup。。

 And he just happens to know all these girls that are at this taco shop。， He， like he laughs。。

 He's like， why do you ever， why do you take your guys to night clubs ever？， Like this is stupid。。

 Just go to these pre-party places where we're having dinners and like we're having these comp dinners。

， Right。， SDK is another one of them， right。， He's like， don't ever take。

 he literally yells at me for taking guys to night clubs。， I'm like， yeah， well， you know。

 I kind of have to do because they kind of expect it。， But he's like， hey。

 I don't just like don't take them to night clubs。， Just take them to these， the taco pre-party。

 taking this other thing。， He just has this list of places and he's the city that he goes to that's just way more effective。

 to meet attractive girls。， He's like， I mean， he has， it's funny to me because this is a guy that。

 that he looks up with way more hot girls， than I ever could dream of。， He looks up with more。

 I mean， we're talking like four to five hot girls a day。， He just crushes it。， And like。

 I don't even know how he has the time for it。， And， you know。

 maybe he's not like every day of the week， maybe three， four days a week he's doing this， right。。

 But a loser。， Exactly。， And he， I mean， it's so funny because he has the same excuses and problems that I have。

， The guys come up to me all the time。， Like， how do you， how do you hear in a night club？。

 It's too loud。， It's too， it's too dark。， How do you get in？， He's got all these same things。。

 He asks me， but he's like， how do you guys even fuck out？， How do you P。A。

 is here in the night club？， And I'm like， oh， you don't really， you just kind of stand closer。

 And he's like， yeah， don't even worry about it。， Just go to these other places。。

 He gives me these huge list of places that are， you know。

 all the pre-party and post-party spots of one-oak warwick， Bootsie， all those kinds of places。

 right。， Yeah， I mean， that's， that's， it's crazy how simple that part is。， And then， how， how。

 how did you， how did you meet that guy in the very first place？， So my group。

 he's actually taught at the first。， I mean， I'm also trained， so like training girls and having fun。

， Hold up guys， we'll get to the second。 Hold up。， So forget about me， some photographer。

 Let's see what we got。 That one's a good one， right。。

 So how do you meet these guys in the first place， right？， Hold up guys。 We have a question。

 we're gonna get out otherwise hold up。， How do you meet these guys in the first place？。

 Because it's sometimes the， the biggest problem I see guys struggle with is that how do you get started in the first place with doing any of this。

， It's the one thing that already have a snowball that's packed and to watch it roll down the hill，。

 it's another thing to actually pack that snowball in the first place。， For the biggest challenge。

 really， is realizing that you have to flank the issue。， You can't just。

 you can't just drive forward。 Even the type of girl that you're into，， you can't just。

 it's very rarely， can you actually just randomly approach that perfect girl that you're，。

 you've been dreaming about for a long time， because you just don't see her very often。。

 So in terms of this， when you actually are trying to get into a high， high on nightclub，。

 the worst that you could possibly do is walk up to that nightclub and talk to them at all to try to get in。

， The second worst thing is walk up to that nightclub with a bunch of girls and then try to get in。。

 That was the， that's one of the biggest myths I think I've ever seen。。

 When I walk up to any nightclub with a bunch of girls。

 what they do is they open the rope for the girls， and then they close the rope and they say。

 all right， well， now how are you going to get in？， They don't， they don't like， they like。

 it's such a myth。 I've never really had that whole thing happen to me。， Not even like one time。

 I remember I tried to do it at pure once when pure was still open in Vegas。。

 I walked up with like five or six girls and we， I'm all excited。。

 I had my PUA pants on and I walked up to the nightclub and I'm like， you know what， what now？。

 And then the guy was just like， all right， here， he let the girls， he's like， yeah。

 it'd be 150 dollar cover for you。， But they're with me， he goes， well， they're with us now。

 And I was like， oh， and thanks。， You know what do I do now？ You know， they're a weird situation。。

 The worst you can ever do is just walk right up to that venue。。

 He said his roommate is a photographer。 DJs and photographers are the two best people to befriend。。

 You befriend the DJ and the photographer for a couple of reasons。 One is both have an， an。

 an amount of access。， Photographers have an auto amount of access because they。

 they're able to bring a huge professional camera into the nightclub。。

 So they just have all this perceived value。 Even though nobody really respects them that much in the club。

， Right？ They just， the club doesn't really care。 No staff member really likes them that much。。

 They're kind of tools on a little bit。 They don't make any money at all really because there's a hundred other photographers that are ready to do exactly the same job behind them。

， But what ends up happy is they're usually photographers that are just kind of degenerates。

 They like to drink and fuck a lot of girls。， A videographer in Vegas who's a good friend of mine。

 He， he， he literally just tried to go as many girls as possible。， His day job is a bartender。

 Vegas is probably the only city where your day job and your nine to five can be bartending。， And。

 and then at night he just does all these free videos for people。 He made， I mean。

 this whole thing is he's made a lot of these Instagram girls famous because he just shoots their videos for free。

， He basically， he's every time he brings a camera equipment to a nightclub or to a shoot with a girl。

 He's got a suitcase that has a custom bar in it。， So he goes and he basically has carries this suitcase around with his camera gear and then just ask them what type of drinks that they want and creates this mini bar situation。

， Well， he's shooting photos and everybody just loves everybody。 He just has a really good time。。

 But the DJ and the photographer， you can make friends with these just photographers because they can't。

 they can't really do anything for you。， Rarely， are you going to be able to like take value from a DJ photographer？

 So by the nature of that relationship， if you befriending them。

 they're just going to be able to get you into nightclub。。

 They're going to get you into these events that are happening。

 Plus DJs and photographers know all the events that are happening without you having to go up and look up all this crap。

， I make friends with these photographers because I don't want to have to go and look up all the different events that are going around town。

， I just want to be texted。 I want to be， I just want， I want to be begged to all these events。。

 I want to wake up to all these different text messages on my phone of girls that I met last night that want to get in touch with me。

 not me having to figure out some clever text message。。

 I don't want to have to go and like Google all the different events that are happening around town。

 I just want people to tell me exactly where those are to save me time。。

 I can do the rest of the shit that I want to do in my life。， When you take a DJ。

 DJs have an interesting situation that just you showing up is you supporting them。。

 Most DJs aren't Tiesto， most DJs aren't chain smokers。

 Once a month you might have a club that has that type of DJ talent。。

 The rest is just local DJs that are probably roommates with this guy and a photographer。

 It's that simple。， I have to understand that most DJs have a comp table。

 They have an area that night that they're able to bring their guests to。。

 DJ has about an unlimited guest list。 Usually， obviously different venues and parties are different。

， The crazy social proof that you can get by being friends with the DJ of that venue is hysterical。

 It's unbelievable。， When they say that when you go up and you actually say that you're on whatever DJs list。

 not only will they walk you in the nightclub， they're going to walk you exactly to whatever table that DJs with。

 Sometimes the actual DJ booth。， Just the active you standing there。

 the snapshot I did a couple weeks ago。 Maybe you see the snapshot a couple weeks ago with a pretty graphic one。

， For those who aren't following my snapshot， 90% of my infields I post right on snap。。

 After they get off snap， it takes months for them to actually come out。， I pulled the five centers。

 Me and four girls。 One girl I've already been sleeping with。

 The other four I met the day before at the pool party。

 The entire way that I was able to make that happen was purely because the social proof of me being in the DJ booth of the pool party that was there。

， I just walked into the DJ booth。 I didn't even do anything that fancy or special。

 I just walked into it。， Because I was at that DJ booth。

 I grabbed the microphone from the DJ and I gave it to my buddy and I said just say my name a bunch of times over the thing。

 It was Michael。 This was all in the snap。 You can all see it right there。， He was like。

 what do you want me to say？ I go， I don't care。 Just say my name and then say in the mumble。

 I don't care。 Just make sure my name is clear。， He started saying Luke into the microphone and then everyone started screaming。

 I was super out of it that morning。 I was wearing a dress。， I was on Saturdays。

 I was on the pool with a dress shirt and shorts。 I was just kind of woke up in a hurry and had to rush to the pool。

 I asked the DJ if I could have one of his hats。 They had the DJs where they were like sailor hats。。

 He asked me to give me a hat。 The two DJs were wearing the sailor hat and I'm wearing the boat hat。

 Then my buddy just said my name over the DJ booth。

 That alone caused this huge group of girls to come to the DJ booth。。

 They tried to put the hat on and take the microphone from the stall。

 They started dancing and formed their tops off and they were covering their tits and whatever。

 It's a pretty aggressive pool party。 I'm like snapping the whole thing。 I'm saying nothing。

 I'm snapping every minute of the thing。， I said you're quiet the whole time。

 He basically just shows it。 He didn't say anything。 I'm holding my snap。

 I'm going to go on this the whole time。 Every once in a while I look at this。 I look at this way。。

 I give this a weird scary face。 I move the snap to something else and I keep going。

 I was doing snapchat for four months before I actually posted a snapchat。

 I was doing snapchat in public because it just makes them go crazy。， I was just deleting snaps。

 There were four months of snaps that are half are saved。 Half were deleted。

 I was like hey we're on snapchat。 We're on snapchat just so I can meet girls and amput up。

 If I'm on the social media platform。 I never posted anything to my story。。

 I only posted something to my story because I did a talk in December about it。

 I knew that this was guys could be benefited from this。

 I saw guys weren't using snapchat so I started doing it。。

 I was just a few blocks away from the bombing happening in New York。

 I was still like this in the snap。 I was looking at all the police sirens happening。

 And they're like wow you're even still stoic in a terrorism situation。

 I guess if you want to look at it I'm really just not saying anything。。

 I was in the situation just a couple weeks ago with those girls and they're all going crazy with a thing。

 But I'm not going to entertain it and actually say that much because it doesn't really help anything。

 I'm already saying at a certain point you should be putting yourself in such high social proof situations where anything that you say verbally is just too much game。

， If you're at that table with your buddies that the promoters and the promoters and promoters and promoters friends and everything。

 Any sort of joking that you could do。 Any escalation that you could do is bad。。

 If you're in these situations with nothing but eights， nines or tens。

 you don't touch them because that's any touching at all is creepy。

 The hotter the girl the less key no escalation you should be doing。 That's just weird。

 That works on girls in bar settings that works on girls when you're walking up and on the street that doesn't work at a high end at the owner's table of oak or of Bootsie。

， So you have to do it。 Because they're there so they aren't touched。

 They're there so you don't touch them。 If they don't want to be key no escalated on。

 If there are nine or ten and they're at that table。

 even if they're not nine or ten and they're just， she's an attractive girl with high self esteem。。

 She wants to physically escalate with one guy that night that she happens to bond with and have some sort of commonality with。

 She doesn't want all these random guys coming up to her and then seeing which one raises her BT spike。

， Instead， she wants to be at that one。 That's nothing too。 Take leading the girl。

 I did a video in Nashville about why isolation is bad。 Why you don't always need to isolate。。

 I have a series of videos coming out of typical pick up things that you think are important when you're a beginner。

 They're just less and less important when you get into the venues that he's gaming in。。

 When you meet a girl at a table at oak， she wants to be led around the club at zero times。

 She won't be led around the club。 If you try to lead around the club， so wonder why you're so weird。

， There's no reason for voice。 They'll literally tell you， you don't have to do this。

 They'll literally tell you that。 They'll look as you're like， you don't have to do all this。。

 Whether it's jokes， whether it's any sort of self amusement at all。

 whether it's any sort of physical escalator， any touching whatsoever。。

 Other than like a light high five， maybe a hand to the hip for half a second。

 Anything other than that starts to be extremely low value。 It starts to be very odd。。

 You're better off doing a kiss to the cheek and a hug every five minutes than you are any sort of physical escalation whatsoever。

 The next thing is this， you have to position yourself at all times as if everybody else is watching you。

， Again， this is only if you're in these types of avenues where you're actually picking up girls that you really could be attracted to。

 These one oak boots you wore with type girls。， This is Los Angeles。

 it was the second biggest city in America and there's four or five nightclubs maximum that I would actually go to if I lived here。

 And then even then there's one nightclub per night that I would actually go to。。

 And in every single one of those venues， there's maximum four to six tables that I would actually sit at or be at。

 I would not be at the bar， I would not be in the hallway or the dance floor。。

 The dance floor game is great if you know how to dance。

 but the problem is there's no dance floor at the table。

 The best type of game you can do at the table is subtle smiles and looks and name exchanges。。

 What's that？， Like you said， the position was like it's so powerful。

 it feels like it's real is walked by and like you're like in the middle of the table like surrounded by a little bit of a hill。

， They can't even get in。， They can't even get in。， What he just said is very important。

 I'll get you。 What he just said is extremely important， right？。

 Which is when you're at the table physically being in an area of high status or high value。

 that builds all the attraction that you could possibly build。， The bucket is already full。

 Any more that you try to do just spills out of the attraction bucket。， Okay。

 like looks don't necessarily have to matter。 Money doesn't have to matter。

 Game doesn't have to matter。 But at some point you have to do something。， Right。

 you can't just focus on man to woman in order to build the attraction with the girl。

 Any form of man to woman stuff in this context that we're talking about is high value context。。

 Any form of man to woman at all， the girl is going to wonder and look at you and be like。

 what are you doing？ Why are you doing this here？， She's literally she's like she's going to be confused because notice if you put yourself in a position that this guy is able to put himself into that I put myself into。

 the girls will come up to you and almost 100% of them at some point in the night will ask what your name is。

， It's the wonder who you are because you just happen to be there not because you've said anything clever。

 not because you've done anything else because you're physically standing there。。

 But using common stuff that I've already said earlier and then I'm going to keep following up with with you guys。

 That's exactly the techniques and how to put yourself in that situation。。

 You're going to notice just physically being there getting that high beard entry smacked down getting into the nightclub getting into that one table area table nine at warwick table four at whatever right。

， Just standing there not even doing that particular not having that big smile on your face just physically being there。

 The girls will come up to you and wonder who you are especially the city like LA San Diego Orange County。

， One of my good friends just opened a nightclub in Orange County。

 I think sutra just shut down his nightclub just opened up and it's called time。。

 The thing about the places like that right is that I've hung out with this guy once that's it。

 I hung out with this guy one time and he's messaging me hey when you're going to be in town when you come to this club。

， Well second I get there I'm not going to go to the bar。

 I'm going to go to whatever table he's set for his invited guests。

 There's no difference between me or you guys every single one of you can do that and every single one of you guys can be like this guy and just go to that exact table area。

， Go for it。 Where the girls generally what？， Where the models are on the table。

 How do you take them further？， How do you take it further？ Who has been in the situation before？。

 So him， him， who else？ Cool。 If your hand isn't raised that's the first thing you should just try to do is get into the situations because I'll tell you what you don't need to fuck your way up。

， You don't need to go after fours then fives then sixs and then eventually gain the skill level to then eventually somehow meet the 10。

， You don't have to do that。 You can just vision board exactly what type of girl that you're after。

 You can go to these types of venues and then immediately go after the girls that you're into and just actually see if there's a genuine commonality between the two of you。

， There will be one on a 10 genuine commonalities with these types of girls and then it's over at that point。

， So what he said is once you're actually in the situations with the model tables or promoter tables。

 how are you actually pulling these girls and how are you actually closing？， Is that the question？

 Cool。， So the first thing you want to do is realize the lower pressure。

 lowest risk stuff that you could do that gets you staying with those girls that gets you doing a Trisha game that's always going to win。

 That just is sometimes a little bit too slow for me because sometimes that takes three or four hours。

， But it will take you into that the realm of that seven hour rule。

 But what you have to understand is this， anything that you do outside the scope of the plan of that social circle group is just going to hurt your chances of actually picking up with them。

， There's some plan for the night。 There's some guided path that those people are are set on。

 There's some whole goal with that。， I used to hit on girls that are like STK， Magnum Mondays。

 Yellowtail。 There's like a couple like there's like always like one high end restaurant that has these comp dinners each night of the week in the major cities。

， STK Mondays was about the best place to hit on girls for several years。 It was amazing。

 But I was always wondering why I was getting phone numbers but like failing with the pool。

 failing with the pool。， It's because they're there having this free comp dinner because then the whole point of that comp dinner so that promoter can take them to some other nightclub and then some other nightclub tour all within the same SB nightclub chain type of situation。

， The real eights are above you guys are trying to talk to you。

 Their night is already planned for them by their girlfriends， by their promoter roommate。。

 So for me， it's much more matter of making friends with the connectors。

 staying into the end of the night and then my success will happen at the corner of 4 a。m。。

 Because you're not going to pull directly from that nightclub in that social setting unless you're one of the rulers of that social circle setting。

 which takes a few weeks， right？ That takes a little bit of time。。

 But if you're being hit on in that setting， by the way。

 being hit on is literally them asking your name， right？

 This literally just kind of having a very general small talk in that setting。。

 So once you're in that area and you're in that general vicinity， they start asking your name。

 just start asking what their plans are， start qualifying them about their plans for the night。。

 And they're going to tell you the exact path you need to follow in order to cope with them。

 Usually there's going to be some food place after。 Then there's going to be a pre-after party。

 There's going to be the post-after party。， And that's all going to take place in 45 minutes to 90 minutes at 201 onward。

 And if you just get yourself to be the guy who just， the way I know a guy， crushes it in each city。

 I was in Chicago about a month and a half ago in a bouquet。， And I just told myself。

 I'm going to find the guys because I was also filming for my social circle product。 I'm like。

 I'm going to find some of the guys that are really crushing it in the city。。

 And I went to about three or four or five after parties。

 And then I accidentally found my way on the Coldplay RV bus thing。 And I filmed the whole thing。

 It was pretty funny。 And I didn't even know one Coldplay song。

 So it was really funny because it's not like I was like seeking them out。

 They were just parked outside my buddies condo。， And I realized that each party that I went to。

 there was like a core group of like three to five guys that were continually being at that venue。

 And they were just the low pressure chillest type of guys that you'd ever meet。

 They weren't trying to escalate。 They weren't trying to pull these girls。

 But when 100% of them closed， the prettiest girls that were there。。

 Because they just knew that attrition is what the most important aspect of that was。。

 So attrition essentially means you're just going to stick in the set。

 stick in the group until it finally comes down to close because everyone else is kind of going to fall off the group at some point。

 Right。 At a certain point， you know， some girls going to get tired， some girls going to get hungry。

 some girls going to have to realize just a work in the morning。。

 And everyone's going to kind of the whole group is going to kind of disperse as the night progresses。

 And then you as you're building these commonalities， these light playful banters。

 everyone's small with the girl that you're trying to talk to。。

 Then you're going to end up being left alone with that girl at the end of the night。

 Does that make sense？ Sweet。 Other questions that I'm in。

 I'm in a little bit different high status situations that did take me a little more time to come up with。

， What I just described for you guys， you guys can do tonight tomorrow this weekend。

 And it takes zero finances to do it。 I just coached a guy。， It was the first time I ever did this。

 I did this。 I coached。 So I answered 100% of my emails， 100% of my snapshots。

 And I coached them all through Snapchat and how to build your own promoter profile。， So essentially。

 let's say you have no money or let's say that money is like a concern or finances are concerned for doing this。

， I showed him how to basically create this fake promoter image in New York so that he。

 so it's a promoter Twitter， it's a promoter IG， it's a promoter Snapchat。。

 And he doesn't want to be a promoter。 He doesn't care about promoting。 But what that does is within。

 I told him， he's like， so what I do now， I post some photos， I'm like， do nothing。

 You'll just be found。， It's such， it's so much about networking and people value this whole concept of networking so much that it's really simple to just take these。

 taking these concepts of what these promoters， photographers， DJs are already doing。。

 Just throw up some profiles of it。 And you're going to notice that these other promoters。

 that these other girls who want to get into night clubs are just going to randomly contact you because it says promoter in your login info。

 It says promoter in your username。， They're going to， this guy right now within about 24 hours。

 he has access to everywhere in New York that he wants to go to。

 purely because he just created the accounts。 He didn't even post photos。 You want to go crazy？

 Just go out， post some photos of tables that aren't yours。。

 Go out and post a photo of a bar like a big group of girls and just like， call them， like。

 what's your name？， There's a Christian Angels hashtag。， Every time you see a big group of girls。

 just throw somebody your camera， you don't even know these girls。 Have them take a photo。

 whatever your name is， Christian is called Christian Angels hashtag or say hashtag with my girls。。

 And all of a sudden， what you're going to notice is that people will just start randomly hashtagging the same thing。

 And you're going to notice that you do this a couple times a night。 You didn't have to。。

 I taught this guy to do it。 He doesn't have any photos of him and girls。

 He has no photos of him and anybody else。 And all that happened， ideally。

 you're actually making friends with these people。， He was kind of lazy， so he didn't really want to。

 So he just wanted to purely use this as a way to get in the nightclub。 He's like， how do I do it？

 Do I bring a bunch of girls to the door at the club？ Do I？， I'm like， no。

 that doesn't help you at all。 The bouncers will laugh at you。 If anything， they'll let the， ideally。

 they might let the girls in。， But this whole idea of like walking up to a club with a bunch of girls。

 it's just a facade。 So instead， I was like， oh， instead， it's all about。

 it's all about social media， whether you like social media or not。 It just works。。

 So I had him just create his name with underscore promoter NYC on all his accounts。

 He doesn't even have any photos on them at all。， And within 24 hours， he's sending me， he's like。

 dude， everyone's hitting me up to get into these clubs。 I don't， what do I do about this？。

 And I'm like， just wait， you're gonna hit up by other promoters who want to share nights with you。

 who want to， you just send girls his way and he'll do the same for you。， And I'm like。

 what do I do about it？ I mean， not having any girls。 I'm like， don't worry about it。

 Just wait a couple hours。， And all of a sudden， he's having night clubs。

 just messaging him to see if he'll come to those clubs。

 He's just getting invited into all these places。 I email， I email night clubs。。

 If I'm going to a place that I've never， I've never been to before。

 I'll just email the main email of the club and say， hey。

 do you mind if I get a complimentary tour of the night club？， I'm a blogger。 I'm。

 sometimes I don't even say that。 Sometimes I just say， do you mind？ I'm coming into town。 I。

 you know， I'd really like to do it。， Sometimes I'll even say， hey。

 my boss is really excited to come check out your night club。 He's looking to really bring some。

 bring some of his work associates there。 Do you mind if I check it out on Thursday？

 He's gonna come on Friday。， Okay， sure。 You want to， it looks like an invited guest and they just。

 they just usher you around the entire night club。 He's like， do you need anything else， sir？

 Do you need anything else？ No， I think I'm good， man。。

 It's a really good bonding with you this whole time， though， sweet。

 And then by the end of that night， you're actually genuine friends with the guy and you don't have to worry about it。

， So， finances， you have to realize there's so many little hacks like this that you can do that you end up being cooler than the guy that is actually spending the money。

， You have to understand most of these， like most of the high-end people that I go。

 that I go with as well， very rarely are they actually ones who are footing the bill。， Right？

 If anything， the club is begging them to come。 So， very rarely do you see the guy who's。

 I especially like out at night like tonight， Thursday or even Sunday。

 like the two best nights to actually go out。， You're very rarely seeing a。

 a night club full of guys that are just blowing money into the situation to create this for themselves。

， It's not a finances kind of thing。 You take the guy like， like what he just described， right？

 Him and the guy back here and myself， when we're at these model tables， we're spending zero dollars。

， Don't ever pay for the table。 Him and all these followers' friends are not paying for the tables either。

， If you're at a table with a lot of hot girls， very rarely did that guy pay for that table。

 Go for it。， Yeah， I mean， you can give energy back to the club。 You don't have to。 You know， you。

 you， I mean， they don't care。 I mean， it's not even a bad way。， I just， like， maybe 10% of the time。

 I like give some energy back to the club or whatever that means。 Like， I'm， I'm， I'm， I'm， I'm。

 I mean， my， my， my Israeli friends call me a Niganouf。， I mean， I'm crazy。 They， you know， they。

 they， you know， I'm kind of nuts at the table， I guess。 I'm kind of nuts in the high value area。

 So eventually they kind of， you know， I'm， you know， but there's really not a lot of like。

 if you look it in that way of like， oh， what kind of value are you trying to do？。

 Or are you trying to add people actually kind of resist that a little bit because they see that you're not just being yourself so that they sometimes they look at you like。

 why are you working so hard to present value or to give so much energy out instead of you just really being yourself in that situation。

， If you're oftentimes， if you're trying to find some way， I have a couple rules， like。

 every now to go to a nightclub， I buy some guy drink that I think he has as more money than me。

 just to network with them。 I do that sometimes。 That's usually， that's paid off a lot for me。

 But I'm not really trying to like look for all these ways that I can add value to all these people。

 I just really look for commonalities more than anything。， If you find a common。

 a genuine commonality with somebody， that's a way better way to add value with them than like。

 how much energy can you put into this situation or this other situation。

 But commonality itself gives you a lot of concrete weight and why you two should actually stay in touch。

， You're going to find that one strong commonality gives you guys hours of conversation。

 Whereas you try to find some way to add value suddenly kind of makes it look more like it's almost like a networking situation。

 Even if it's pure energy or pure fun， you're trying to put into it。。

 It's very apparent to people that do this all the time， guys that go out a lot。

 It's very apparent that you're trying to， that we're trying at all， right？ Does that make sense？

 Sweet。， Question with that， go for it。， I'm lucky enough to have a private security job now。

 I'm a little bit of Orange County。 I made a lot of friends that way。

 And the one spot I particularly like was the Newport Beach。

 where parking spots there could go for $100 on the right day。。

 And I have access to a big parking lot because I know all the guys are driving right there。

 It is security there。 And when I do start working very close because I get more like advanced in the company。

 do you have any advice for who I could talk to while I work security there？。

 Maybe give my club a door or maybe somebody who not necessarily like let me in first time to know my face and maybe buy me back。

， What do you were proud of to hear it before？ I mean， for night clubs over。。

 I was carrying some private trade firms。 So we were whoever called us。

 Right now I've got a contract going to a resort in Newport to work with the easy concert。

 I'll be there with 50 of my regards。， That's amazing。 I mean， G easy will beat us all。 I mean。

 G easy is perfect。， You should be studying as Instagram， studying every way that guy walks。

 He's perfect for gay。， The company actually used to have a contract for where your friends is having a e-spec feature。

 These would be there， but now I think they're going to start going for a contract to get to the Newspot on two。

， That time？ Yeah， time。 Yeah。 I mean， I'm like， you guys are saying too。

 You guys are the most managers of clubs。 Most owners are PUA's。 That's why they're doing it。。

 I used to have this saying with it with guys。 It's somebody's getting laid out of that。 Right？

 The vice president of E of Insomniac gives me in all of my biggest immersion guys free tickets to EDC or like $100 tickets。

 $100 or less tickets。， Because he's an actual PUA because he likes this stuff。

 Why else would you do a stupid business like start a nightclub？

 Because you want to hook up with girls and network with guys。。

 So this whole thing of us doing this in terms of this like secretive kind of thing is so silly to me。

， Minimum once a week， I get some nightclub promoters actually being like， oh， you're into pickup。

 That's cool。 I mean， that alone is a pretty solid connection。

 The guy who started that club that I talked about。

 I know him because we started talking about gaming in a nightclub once。。

 So this whole thing about us doing this under the radar pickup stuff， it's about the coolest。

 most normal thing you could be doing。 We can make it weird and creepy。

 It doesn't need to be weird and creepy。 You understand？

 You could do the weird and creepy intercircle stuff。， Like what I was talking about， right？ But no。

 it's just funny。 I mean， most valets I know in Vegas， Miami， New York。 Most of the ones that I know。

 I've met because they were talking game and I started talking game back with them。。

 Most nightclub security guys， they got this， I know most bouncers that I know are also a daytime job that's like lawyer。

 accountant。 They have a fairly professional job。 They just realized that they didn't want to go game all the time。

 So they decided， let me create， let me do this job。 But they wish that they were outgaming。

 But any PUA they know， a lot of them are like， in intercircles throughout America。

 They'll just let any PUA into the nightclub because they like the cause so much。， So for you。

 just realize that you just like working security for a GZ concert that alone will get you in a nightclub。

 right？ Just start talking about it。 Just start talking about the fact that you work security for this club or that club to everybody else。

 And then all of a sudden the filters are going to naturally progress through that conversation。。

 Commonalities will progress。 Common points and interests。

 Common things you guys have done before will kind of progress。

 And that's going to be how you actually do the people collection， right？， Also。

 just value arbitrage。 Like here's the thing， like there's every time that I ever have access to a table。

 a photographer， a DJ， an event， whatever it might be。。

 I immediately want to give it out to somebody else that I don't really want to try to take advantage of that event that I could actually attend。

 Right？ So when I have， you know， so basically any event in Vegas。

 I can get pretty much almost unlimited tickets to for any access。 Right？， Well。

 I'm only in Vegas when I'm doing my Vegas program other than that， you know。

 I'm traveling and I'm here talking to you guys like you。

 So what I'll do is I'll actually just pass that arm to other people or let's say I have a friend who's doing some really cool event and he's got like smash global is happening。

 right？， Like I've got sent a bunch of them to smash global。

 but there's no way I can even possibly attend it with my schedule。

 but I still have a bunch of people there。， So what they then do is they see that that's a lot of value I'm bestowing upon them。

 So then I get invited to other things。 Right？ So for you。

 just purely talk about the things that you're doing because you have an easy in because it's。

 it's a very common thread that you can talk to them about。。

 The harder part is if you're a guy who has a， you know， a nine to five， maybe maybe it runs。

 maybe it's more of like a， like an eight to seven。

 And you don't really have any sort of party kind of or social kind of the topic that you can talk to people about。

 Right？， Yours is super simple。 Go for it。， So I'm fortunate not to have a job where I'm doing my emotions。

 Do you have any recommendations？ I want to， I find that it's really taking advantage of that。。

 You're all by social media and you connect with right？

 Definitely recommendations about how I feel about doing that。， Yeah。

 so you're going to be a promoter or what do you， what's nightlife， what does that mean？

 What's that mean？ What's that mean？， Got it。 You're like a promo girl。 Cool。 Yeah， I mean， yeah。

 I mean， anything like that， anything like that is a good Macuffin， right？ You know， Macuffin is。

 a Macuffin is like a stick。 It's a thing。， He's going to talk to people for you and you and anybody else in here who's come up with a good Macuffin。

 it's easier than anything else， right？， You know， my best friend， he does a bikini contest。

 He's been hosting these things for a long time。， You know， three years before he ever hosted one。

 he was telling me that he's like， you know， that's something that he wants to do。。

 And he always would do it basically for free。 And the whole point and now he gets invited basically to help with almost any bikini contest that goes around because that's his Macuffin。

， He doesn't really， he doesn't really give a fuck about being paid for。

 He doesn't really care about what happens。 He just purely in it for his reason to invite girls to other ones。

 right？， For you， you have a Macuffin。 Your thing is this promotional product thing that you're shoving out people's thoughts。

 right？， So whatever the thing is， hopefully it's something of value。

 hopefully it's something that people actually like。， And it's an easy way to talk to people。

 Everyone else has either cold approach or build their social circles。 You have this Macuffin。

 You have this stick， this thing that you can talk to people about。， It's a very easy way to do it。

 right？ It's something that sounds like it's better than selling knives outside of target parking lots。

 right？ Go for it。， Okay， I'm saying like， say go to a nightclub。， Hypothetically， randomly。。

 See you around。， Same like at a nightclub。 And it's like， so I like what you said， like。

 what's going on my attention to what you said was talking my way through the nightclub。。

 So how do you go about doing that， especially when it's more like a higher barrier than entry？。

 We say， okay， talk your way into the nightclub or talk your way through it as you're progressing through the nightclub。

， Okay， cool。， So talk your way into the nightclub。， Talk your way into the nightclub。

 You need a reason to get in and you basically want to knock at them any reason to say no。。

 So the number one way to get into a nightclub is to dress like all the club cunts， right？。

 So a club cunt is a club cunt as a nightclub promoter， a photographer， a regular。。

 A club cunt is part of the fickle 500。 A club cunt can be a male or female。。

 It's not a derogatory term。 It's literally just a regular person that would attend that nightclub。

 right？， So in LA， I feel like sometimes it's like dressed like as much of a homeless person as possible in the nightclub。

， You're going to notice that club cunts， males will wear really long， I call them Kanye shirts。

 shirts that go down to your knees， with the slit in each side，， where the boots。

 with the tight fitting pants that to get tucked in， dress like a club cunt， right？。

 Like a club thought， right？ You dress like that， and then literally you walk up，。

 and I like to just try to walk into the nightclub without them actually ever having。

 what's that about？， I like to do that without actually having them even ask me any questions and just like lift the rope up to see a couple tell me if I'm acting club cunti enough。

， And if you're acting club cunti enough， right？ You're acting like a club thought。

 they'll just let you in because of that，， without actually saying any long confusing sentiments。。

 It's shorter and sweeter the better， but it's a lot of fun because normally I have a lot of social proof when I go into the club。

 when I was doing this thing in New York， I would just go to these nightclubs and just see how club cunti I could be and just talk my way into each one。

， The next thing is this， knowing one person's name at each club works really well。。

 I'm going to give you one little trick that I did that's a little bit high risk。。

 When you don't know anybody in the club， ideally you have to come up with someone's name that works there。

 It's very， very easy。， I'm going to go to one area of the entryway and I'll ask him。

 I'll simply ask him， hey， you know， what's that guy's name or who's running the door today？。

 He'll tell me the guy's name， oh cool， what's your name？ Hey， great to meet you。。

 And then you could just walk straight up to that guy and say， oh， what's up， Jimmy Taylor。

 He just said that you could let me in。， Let's go。 And then you could literally just ask one guy。

 what is name is just having those having those two guys names that alone can get you in。。

 Another thing you could do is literally just look up the name of the guy who's running the venue。

 And there's a little trick you can do in your phone where you save your own number as somebody else's name。

， And you text yourself and that way we'll ask to see a text。 You can just delete it。
