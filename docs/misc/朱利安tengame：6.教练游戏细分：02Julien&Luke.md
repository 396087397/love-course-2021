# 朱利安ten game：6.教练游戏细分：02 Julien & Luke

這是朱利恩，我'm here with Luke， Welcome to the second instructor game breakdown video。

 And what I thought we could start off with here， is pretty much talking about your personality。

 or who you were before the game， and then we can kind of see how you took this and really used game to amplify it。

 instead of say trying to become someone else， or getting stifled by all the rules of the game， Yeah。

 I mean it's crazy right， because the advice that your sister would give you。

 or your mom would give you， or you know just kind of， even your teacher would give you。

 if you're like in a middle school or elementary school， and you're thinking about。

 you know like the Valentine's Day kind of situations， it's the advice of just be yourself。

 it's kind of the advice that we always run away from， because just being ourselves has gotten。

 you know the layman's results that， that we've kind of have gotten in the past。

 so then just be yourself isn't， no I want to be the person who's getting the results I want to get。

 it's kind of like what comes in our minds right， so the whole idea like just be yourself。

 you almost have to go through this process of almost， realizing that way way。

 no I can't just be myself because I might， if I just keep being more of myself。

 I'm gonna get just more of the same results， so immediately like when I first heard about。

 this thing called game or pickup or， or whatever I immediately was like wait。

 you mean there's this whole like like， like Bible like you open it。

 just like like glowing full of like different tactics， and different things that you can do。

 to be this other guy that's gonna get me， all this magical results。

 and like the more you go through these different techniques。

 of stuff that you know maybe you weren't already doing。

 you start seeing all these different cool results， but eventually you get to this point where。

 that advice of just be yourself is the best advice you can possibly have。

 because what going through that roadmap of， crap or stuff allows you to do， is it really allows you。

 a way that to take the different things that make， maybe get an archetype for yourself。

 it takes those those different characteristics that you have。

 and allow them to kind of amplify them， and make those your most attractive characteristics。

 like for me for example I was， I was definitely never known as like the shy guy。

 right when I was I was never like， I was never like the shy guy who like couldn't talk to people。

 but I was always too obnoxious I was always too， uncalibrated but in terms of my ability to。

 I mean it was kind of actually very frustrating for me。

 for someone who's shy currently they might see， you know they might look at that and be like oh that's awesome。

 you know you know you didn't have to， to go anywhere you had an easier path but for me。

 it for me it was a matter was very frustrating， because I was I definitely had it didn't have any issue。

 opening my mouth but I still had zero results with women。

 you know even from a young age so it was like wait。

 so I thought you know having you know the mouthpiece。

 or being able to open your mouth and do all the crazy， self-emusement things I thought that was。

 like what you did at least that's what you， are first told right so then when you're doing all those things。

 and you're not getting the result， you think that that ends up being a very frustrating thing。

 right but through a through my gang journey， I've realized that it's you know that。

 like kind of honing that and calibrating that， two different situations has been some of my biggest asset。

 so the ability for me to kind of be this like， glowing ball of energy I guess throughout the venue。

 or throughout different social situations， what it does is it really attracts people to me。

 it makes it very magnetic which then allows me to do， introductions to people it allows me to do。

 things like merging sets something that you do really well。

 and you and I have done it in the club quite a few times。

 simple concepts like that it allows me to do very， very well because I take what's already。

 what I already have in the store like what I already， already have kind of at my own instincts。

 which is to bring people together and， and actually try to create these you know。

 you know basically create another layer， of social game almost like a meta layer of social。

 game throughout venues or throughout even cities， to really just create such a magnetized style of。

 game that everyone kind of wants to meet each other， and then they credit you with everyone。

 with them meeting each other and you just get a lot of。

 fall off value and a lot of fall off attraction， from that so one thing that was a lot like。

 really difficult for me it， and it was first realized it realized in。

 game and kind of understanding it all， as I thought it was pure rudimentary tactical game。

 I was like oh what degree should my left foot turn， I mean I mean I even read like an article once。

 about the 45 degree secret to pussy pounding pleasure， in seven seconds or less and I was like。

 oh you so you stand like this， but then I was like wait I'm standing too far。

 and it was just interesting I was just， remember like sometimes that stuff。

 was just kind of getting the way of my natural ability， which was connecting people together。

 and then kind of sitting back and watching it happen。

 really realizing that a lot of things that I was able to do。

 was just introduce people to each other， allow them to game each other。

 kind of create what I call a game leverage， right create this kind of game leverage。

 where you just kind of get the ball rolling， and then they build the attraction for you。

 and you just kind of really get taken under their wing， and then you get the attraction。

 as own really what's called attraction arbitrage， and that was something that I had deep down inside of me。

 but I wasn't really employing it before a game， but going through the game journey it allowed me to kind of bring that up in myself。

 yeah yeah with that beer self advice too it's like。

 I talked about this a lot of the promotional videos for this product too。

 and I there were like some comments like well， if I'm being myself like where are the results。

 but I always say it's like the yourself， or who you think you are say before the game。

 it's like you don't really know who you are， it's like most of the time you put on this front。

 or you know either say extroverted or shy， usually because it's based fear of some degree。

 and you're like this is me not really， because going through game it's like you kind of keel away at that shit。

 and you find out who you truly are， because you said you kind of found out like oh。

 I'm this guy likes to go out and like make people connect so on and so forth。

 you kind of found that through the journey that is game。

 for me I got very in tune with what specifically， I wanted my life to look like。

 and then I realized that myself is in tune with that kind of lifestyle。

 and whatever filled whatever like， it was almost like that book emeth revisited。

 right that business book about how you kind of plan out， all the different positions in a business。

 and then you fulfill them whether you actually have those people or not。

 and you kind of work towards that， that's kind of how I realized my ultimate I guess。

 good feeling of how to live my life day to day， is I was like all right well what does my ultimate life just look like。

 because that's authentic to me that's the most natural thing I want。

 is even though if I don't have it yet， I just want to really define what my perfect。

 Thursday Friday Saturday night looks like， and then I took steps to just really make that happen。

 and for me it was like let's take for example， for me I realized that like hooking up with hot。

 girls was awesome but also meeting really cool， and even more importantly successful guys。

 and coming in and out of my life is way more important to me than。

 than just boy meets girl you know boy hooks up with girl right。

 to me it was like this whole lifestyle kind of thing， I read a quote in Maxime magazine。

 a long time ago which was you know the point is to be the guy。

 that all girls want to be with but also that， all guys want to be to me that's like the kind of the cornerstone。

 or everything I think about in game because， to me that's that's more idealic of what I consider。

 social success really is right， so what I realized is that for me to get you know。

 the the 9s and 10s for me to move through cities， and actually never have to pay cover for a nightclub。

 for me to always have day 2s to close 100% of my day 2s。

 to kind of hit these like game these geeky game metrics。

 that I had like in the beginning why I was first learning game。

 the way to do that is is really employing， this social status style of game that ended up。

 that I realized like that was really what was going to。

 that really was my roadmap that was going to get me， to my kind of geeky goals anyway。

 and then as I was doing that is I realized that that was my highest。

 impact thing that I could do I realized that was the most。

 natural thing for me to do that that that was what was。

 loud kind of like dig down deep and just get rid of all these。

 blockages as you talk about like off of me， just doing that like like high high social。

 return investment kind of thing right where， it wasn't even a lot of work for me to do it I mean like。

 game has to be fun all of this stuff has to be super。

 enjoyable otherwise it's just it's just too much work。

 like there's just so much involved that if it's not。

 enjoyable and it becomes like this like for me it's like I。

 I end like a work day I remember I was like writing software。

 before I became pick up coach right and I remember a game。

 for me was my outlet I looked at game to like release。

 like any any like negative stress it like I got， like I remember like I would get tired from work。

 and then like I would start gaining three four hours into gaming。

 I was almost like I popped some like caffeine pills。

 and had some red walls from you know just because like it。

 it'll out like freed myself so much it was like my own。

 version of like art basically I guess if you will right。

 so that's really how I take that yeah same same I love going out it was。

 never like oh my god like going out like how do I need to be motivated。

 like how can I motivate myself to go out um but I love what you said。

 there too because that's exactly what I talk about in 10 game where。

 instead of becoming a slave to the game where it's like there's all these rules。

 like okay how can I close 100% on the day too how can I maximize。

 you know the validation and so on and so forth you really made it work for you。

 it's like this is the life I want these are the results that I。

 want for me without getting sucked into the the hype for some of the negative。

 conditioning of a game and how can I use game and make game mind to get there。

 game is to me is not about finding out the exact way that I want to get this。

 result and if it doesn't fall in line with that， that I'm not going to do it a lot of guys come up to me and they're like well。

 how do you gain in this kind of situation where you have to take the girl。

 away from our group how do you isolate the girl from the group。

 and I was like why are you trying to do that so hard。

 right this was just actually a couple days ago I go I。

 over 75% of my my lays in my situate my interactions。

 I bring the whole group back I don't even I don't even worry about。

 isolate so it's for me it's it's crazy how many PUA is well actually put。

 their own blockages and their own issues in the way because that's in their。

 mind like how it's kind of supposed to go， where in reality you have to figure out your own way of how you want to go。

 and what I've found is the more the more social game that you have the more。

 social proof you create the more pre-selection that you establish。

 the less crap and technique you actually have to do and the more the gaps。

 just kind of fill in it's almost like when you were a kid and you did the。

 draw the dots you try to draw the image between the dots。

 you just put a few dots in place like pre-selection and social proof。

 and the rest just falls in place for you it's pretty amazing how easy。

 all happens when you just put in the right social dots。

 well what would you say are some of the big sticking points someone who's。

 say full cold approach kind of getting into the situations where it's more。

 social reputation you're actually hanging out like you're now part of the。

 group with the girl i mean i've seen guys like who just can't stop like。

 gaming where it's like they just keep acting like if it's a first。

 open or some of the common sticking points to see making that transition。

 yeah the number one sticking point making that transition is thinking that。

 is thinking that each one is is independent of the next one。

 i actually never thought it you know the most natural thing for me was actually。

 creating my social circle methodology that i call elevated pickup right。

 because it was so natural because i never thought in my head i want to be。

 the social game guy i was pure cold approach um i still do a lot of cold。

 approach i love it to that it's my favorite hobby that i can possibly do。

 but what happened that happening is i just also thought that it was a waste of。

 time to for every cold approach either succeed or fail succeed or fail。

 it was like well wait this this is a lot of time that i'm putting into this。

 why am i just letting these these girls that i have like。

 you know those interaction that you have that are like 10 to 15 minutes。

 and they don't really go poorly but you aren't really sure like if you。

 should continue it um and then you just kind of do a lot of those like you。

 kind of get stuck in that early midgame we call it i just realized i want to take。

 advantage of all of that time that i'm spending and just throw them into my。

 social circle so it originally started with this， facebook group that's a private facebook group i have them basically all over。

 america and they're just completely closed groups it's just me and a bunch。

 of girls and you know a couple cool guys in each city um and we just threw。

 parties i caught the first party was called champagne kisses。

 and the whole thing is i was like you know what these girls think i'm funny。

 enough they think i'm reasonably cool enough to talk to but。

 we're not gonna date i'm not gonna sleep with them we're not gonna hook up。

 but why am i just like why why am i head am i thinking that if we're not gonna。

 hook up with each other i'm just gonna ignore it completely。

 and just think that it's never gonna happen it's a lot of social leverage。

 of the you know they're they call it the I think they call it the cheerleader effect。

 where you have like five girls that you know that are like five seven say next to each。

 other obviously it looks like they're all lines yeah it's kind of a similar。

 effect that i can i could employ by just me knowing all of these girls that are of。

 you know varying degree of attractiveness and i realized that hey you know you。

 you're usually only going to sleep with one girl per night that's a lot of。

 interactions in your night of cool interactions with decent people that if you。

 just you know fuck the phone and i'm not even gonna get it。

 fuck the Facebook close i'm not even gonna get it it takes what 20。

 seconds maybe to get that Facebook close at number of close and the mere exposure。

 of them seeing that you're always doing reasonably cool things that you。

 see and kind of then peer into your lifestyle of you doing cool things all。

 the time builds that interest interaction over time and that's just a。

 just a lot of a lot of good stuff that you can you can kind of maintain so。

 the number one thing is realizing that every interaction you're in that's。

 that's adding value to that interaction whether you succeeded or failed。

 in that particular interaction to me that's the most abundant mentality you。

 can have that there's no bullets such thing as a blowout that every every time。

 you speak to a girl there's a lot of value they're back and forth that you can。

 hold on to that and kind of stack that forward yeah value in the vibe but also。

 just value you know just like superficially like a lot of those girls who。

 guys find like unattractive like oh i'm not gonna waste for the number。

 have like massively like claw friends and just like for getting the fucking。

 number it's like remember like she can introduce you to these people。

 introduce these people these people these people so on and so forth so instead of。

 viewing it just like superficially like oh it's a waste of time it's like you。

 know go for it yeah i mean you gotta be building your pipeline you have to be。

 building your pipeline the cool thing too is you know like aggressive social。

 circle building has helped me with my same nightlay game and aggressive day two。

 building has helped me with my same nightlay game as well because it gives you a。

 different like 360-degree view of social interactions。

 it's crazy me how a guy will think to himself that he wants to be this good player。

 and fuck all these girls all the time and then but but not really have the social。

 skills to get into a nightclub without paying or to then not be able to have。

 friends it doesn't make sense to me when a guy is really really good at cold。

 approach and doesn't accidentally develop a social circle along the way。

 it's it's like what the girls either just like love you to death or they。

 had wanted nothing to do with you like there should be some there should be。

 some commonality building some social skill building along the way where maybe。

 that it didn't develop in such a way where you actually slept with the girl but there's still。

 this wave of cool guys and hot girls that wants to to invite you to things that want you to。

 invite them to things in a way i think it's also like the whole pickup conditioning that kind。

 of pushes you towards us like get the lake get the lake get the lake yeah and you're like oh it's。

 all about the lake you just get so like head down for the some the lake you forget to apply all this。

 to you know friendships or your life in general like mentioned here i think it's actually just。

 putting too much work on yourself like somebody asked me the other day like how do you how do you。

 get yeah that like it was two days ago i was with somebody and they're like well how do you。

 you know what do you do and you know you're trying to get the girl away from her friends and i was。

 like man just think about it for a second that's kind of a creepy thing to do like to work so hard。

 and have the girl watch you work really hard to isolate even the word just sounds like a little。

 bit you know date line is right like to try to like isolate the girl from her girlfriends well。

 most of the time if you try to invite the whole group back anyway part of the group is going to be。

 like no we're good here what you guys just go anyway it's the fact that you're trying to be so。

 possessive of the girl in that social setting to cause us the group then to be like no no she's。

 going to stay with us i think this is not going to happen right if you're super social and you're just。

 almost like kind of indifferent but you're still really progressively moving the interaction。

 forward the friends are like oh yeah he doesn't want anything from this at all now you can have。

 our girl as the sacrificial lamb to your night you know that's like heavy screening game right when。

 you're like so focused on the lay that you're just like like doing pure like screening game and i'm。

 just thinking it's just there's a lot of time of a lot of sets that just don't fall within that。

 screening criteria whereas you do this heavy social like this heavy social game um that it's just。

 it's so natural like it's almost like it's almost like you turn game into like this surfing。

 situation you're just surfing the wave and it just feels so easy that the lay has just come to you。

 with such little such so much less effort involved by you that it's you're using all this leverage。

 that you're gaining to get the girl um it's it's it's just it's just crazy how much more natural it is。

 to you know it's funny too you don't need months or weeks to build a good social circle type of game。

 you can do it in one night right and that's why like every set that you're in should catapult you。

 into the next interaction and most like if i just go to a new city um that i've never been to go for。

 or within a very short period of time girls are wondering how many how many years i've been in the city。

 or how i know everybody and it's just it's just using just some basic techniques。

 it you can use that social style of game to kind of build this mesh throughout the venue where。

 you're just really kind you're just really this really clever social guy in the venue and it's。

 not like you're you know seal team six sniper approach yeah yeah just merging will do that's like。

 you start merging and people are like oh my god you know everyone you know and you don't stand out。

 either is he i'd be in like the pick up guy going first you know he sets like you're out of one so。

 you're out of two one out of three uh and the cool thing is you can still aggressively close once。

 the attraction equities been built right once you've bounced back and forth i think one thing too。

 is a lot of guys are very timid uh and they're intimidated by gaming what gaming a girl and then。

 hopping out of interaction with that one girl and then coming back to her they're very nervous about。

 that that's something you and i do all the time i mean i'll i mean like you one thing that i noticed。

 i haven't seen be else do besides me and you is we'll like leave our girl with another guy put it。

 on the burner like on the warm side of the grill and then we'll go off in the other venues of the。

 club and then come back to her and then reignite it i'll do that multiple times throughout the night。

 without being nervous that that guy is gonna aim augment your steal the girl or something yeah yeah。

 yeah i do it because well on one hand it reinforces abundance like if you can't let her go it's like。

 you're already scarce it's already over so it's like give him away and every time i do it too it's like。

 what guys fail to realize is that who's the girl going to be thinking of me it's like wait who's。

 that guy why is he giving me away how do you know julie how do you know luke oh that guy so。

 and i oh that guy such an asshole that guy that guy that guy and i just do it all the time like。

 i'm like five girls i's like oh here's my friend here's my friend there's my friend it just plant。

 them there and they just keep talking about me they see me game these other girls my friends are。

 bragging about me and then at the end it's just easy exactly yeah but i think it's also that pressure。

 where you think that a girl if she sees you game another girl she'll lose attraction when。

 reality it's the opposite so i think that's the most attractive thing you can do yeah i mean if。

 you take that away from me i'm gonna be like why are we working so hard i mean pre-selection is。

 one of the only scientific proven things to actually you know it's that it's one of those only。

 things that like p-waves haven't come up with that's that real psychologist have come up with right。

 yeah and like what like the thing is if you're doing heavy aggressive polarizing game and just。

 dumping your intent on every single girl you see then yeah it's a little bit weird because now you're。

 this you're here's the thing it's attractive to be the guy that all girls wants but it's not。

 attractive to be the guy that's trying to go after every single girl right so it's a lot in body。

 language it's a lot in like you know it comes back to some game fundamental game concepts like。

 locking in if you're locking in really the properly positioned your body where it's like the girl。

 is talking to you and every interaction you're in there's no limit to the amount of girls that。

 you can talk to it's the most ultimate social thing you can do in any context yeah yeah and also。

 just remembering that she's not you because I think a lot of guys like kind of project where she's。

 they're like man if I leave her she's gonna get crushed you know her whole identity is like on me。

 and she sees me game another girl what is she gonna think she's gonna be hard-broken not。

 understanding the for girl a lot of the time her going out is just like it's fun and like hard。

 it which is what it should be for you know guys as well but we're like man if a girl did that to。

 me I'd be crushed so then it's like you're just stuck on that one girl you get you get knocked out。

 a good state yeah yeah and it's like a loose loose because then you're stuck on her because you don't。

 want to like go game other girls in front of her but that makes you even needy and it just drags。

 you both down we've game together it's always been a fucking blast what are some tips or how did。

 you kind of make that transition from a lot of efforts well apart from like the social aspect of。

 it how did you kind of bring that humor laughing allow yourself to laugh and have a blast versus just。

 doing the game reps and like okay we're in the trenches now and and then kind of how do you。

 cultivate that humor or amplify that humor anything along those lines there yeah totally so。

 I think the first thing to understand there's just a couple big concepts with it right I think。

 the first thing to understand is that most guys is even P。O。A。 who come on boot camp or you know。

 come to come see me in Vegas or whatever they're they're funny around their friends they're。

 funny around their family right most of these guys it's like they have funny jokes they know I。

 mean we all we all know what humor is we all we're very it's very easy to be funny around our。

 family and friends it's very easy for us to you know goof around and do whatever right it's when。

 we get into these these these group think kind of situations in like nightclubs or or day game。

 situations that that we kind of restrict that that humor ability because we think that we're supposed。

 to act in a certain way or that we don't maybe we don't necessarily aren't comfortable or familiar。

 with these people so it takes a lot of people it takes a while for a lot of people to get warmed up。

 right or get warmed to somebody or then they can tell the jokes I think one of the first things。

 that I realized is that if I want to have the kind of massive success and progress that I wanted。

 I had to just treat the world like it was just one even playing field and it's not I don't。

 I don't I'm not going to change the way that I act whether I'm in a social setting or I'm with。

 family or if I'm in a work setting however I am I'm just going to act like whatever the version。

 of me that I want to be is I'm just to act like that all of the time you know what it's funny when。

 all people talk about like turning game off or turning game on right I don't that doesn't even cross。

 my mind because what got me to be funny and what got me to be outgoing is realizing that I'm。

 just going to be that I'm going to so much bandwidth of Luke through the pipeline at all times。

 and I'm just going to see whatever happens and just you know I'm going to I'm going to assess。

 things afterwards and you know what if I if I break something I'll pay for it if I if I make some。

 you know horribly awkward joke you know if worse comes worse I'll apologize whatever it might be。

 but I'm just going to be the version of myself that I want to be at all times and not really。

 restrict myself or change whether I'm with one group of friends or another or with this one。

 person or a different person right that that allows me then to just be the really the most。

 you know the most awesome version of myself that I can possibly be so a lot of guys just need to。

 realize that that's just not the way that it's next I came up with all these different ways to。

 just have fun all these make gambits all these different things that really caused me to realize。

 that hey this is anything social you basically in an arena right it's like it's funny that people。

 are so stifled in nightclub nightclub is the most ridiculous place you could possibly be in as an。

 adult like almost anything goes like it's not yeah you know it's this it's this weird if it wasn't。

 for the craziness that's that's allowed in these nightclubs then there's no point in being there。

 right I mean if it wasn't for the women there's no point in that guy even ever stepping foot into。

 a nightclub right it's just it's just kind of ridiculous so one thing to realize is like I've。

 I've all a huge list of these different things that I do like to stop the the straw trick I do this。

 thing where I have a bunch of straws and I stick them together while I'm talking to a girl and。

 then I have her put her hand out it's a kind of guide the straw and I just drink someone's drink。

 like four feet away and I was just like suck the drink dry and then I'll like move my hands up。

 and the girl's suck holding the straw and then it's just it's absolutely hysterical it works。

 all it works every single time it creates this huge fun vibe it builds massive attraction right。

 away I have this thing with me and my wings you see this back and they already take off our belts。

 on the dance floor hand it to a girl that we were into when we do limbo under the belts and just。

 keep lowering the belt and we just create this and it's like the girls would just ignore big time。

 DJs because they're so busy like doing the limbo underneath the belt basically realizing that like。

 anything that I think would be funny to do in the nightclub and even kind of awkward like。

 even both those things could be really awkward but because I think that they're fun and funny。

 and it's got nothing to do with normal nightclub activities everyone has a riot everyone's in。

 uproar they all think it's hilarious and then it all it works very very well and lastly another。

 little gambit that he was all sent a big tray of shots over to like a basketball party of。

 group of girls filled with tap water but I'll have the bartender put salt on there and like。

 garnish it with a lime and I have the bartender tell them that it's I haven't kind of get in on it。

 and have them tell hey you know this is this is sent from those guys over there it's a really。

 new type of tequila it's you know it's it's it's it's the special type of a nao you really want to。

 you really want to take it back and you take it all at once and they'll slam it and nobody。

 really want no girl really wants to be the first one to admit that it was just water they're just。

 kind of confused and then I wasn't we just bust the lap bust out laughing and then they're they。

 you know they end up coming over and like you know freaking out on us hey why'd you do that。

 and it was just a fun funny thing to do so when you have this huge list of like gambits and。

 different funny things like that in your arsenal um you know it that that still work as good game。

 then you end up a self-amusing yourself but forward not backward right so all these。

 very self-amusement concepts you want to think of ways that incorporate self-amusements。

 still within the context and framework of what good game would be yeah rather than it rather。

 than you using it as a way it's like a scape good game yeah yeah it's like the the goal is still like。

 you building something with the girl um I'll see guys for example sometimes right well we'll。

 just recently it's like oh I approached in the mall with like in the lingerie department with my。

 hand above my head and my leg high yelling hey like that and she didn't she didn't like me I'm like。

 dude that's not self-amusement like that's not playing to win that's like you know freaking the girl。

 out doing some stupid shit it's like you're still aiming to like get the girl bringing her in on the。

 fun and yeah moving it forward as you said yeah it's got but people don't understand about that is。

 the whole like make sure you're having fun at some point she also has also has to be having fun。

 yeah yeah it's like how can I feel good how can she feel like how can we both feel good and then。

 move that for its sex which is the ultimate self-amusement um the the last thing I'd say is if you have。

 any I'd say what one thing I've just been stressing on a lot is like game is really about like。

 having fun having a blast while out having those like epic experiences those awesome stories。

 which just kind of look back on your like holy shit um if you could share one of yours like if。

 you think back to your journey in the game uh one story uh that just really stands out where you're。

 like like that's what I'm in this for or or something you just you'll you'll just never forget it's。

 like one of the stories that sticks around for years yeah I mean I I just have I have a huge huge。

 list of stories in my in my later sports and field reports that are like that um I'll just go。

 with the most recent one I mean two nights ago um you know me and a student in Vegas immersion。

 pulled three girls back from uh from the nightclub and I mean it was I mean it was it was just a very。

 very aggressive situation I mean like nights like that are what I consider average nights but also。

 kind of the nights that I that I'm in this for right um because here's the thing like it's just。

 it's just it's too easy to get into a situation where you're gaming for a day two you hook up。

 at the day two you're just a part of your life it's just it's you're learning too many awesome。

 with skills and you're getting it's just you're putting too much effort into for it to just end。

 there right it's got to it's got something more has to be there something that you can really。

 anchor anchor your experiences and stories to have these crazy anecdotes so we're in the。

 nightclub it was a very quick pull um you know you know we were in the we're in the club I was with。

 a girl um we we we met these other two girls they were they were all over it um we basically。

 within two three minutes stopped them making out with each other um growing each other in the night。

 club basically you know I mean again getting into a point where they're actually fingering each。

 other in the nightclub then we you know they're like oh you know my friend our friend is over here。

 we're about to go pull that friend and all of a sudden I see that my student is talking to。

 their friend and then just creates this crazy social situation um and then about five minutes。

 in after that um like you know hey let's just keep this social situation is really fun let's。

 just move it back and then immediately we all went into just um into this car together in this。

 limo it was uh it's actually it was all on my snapchat about a day and a half ago and um and。

 it's just it's just this really really social situation but the crazy that you know is heavy。

 buying temperatures throughout the entire interaction that kind of held it together um then we。

 all pull you know in the in the middle of the limo there are everywhere like it's just basically。

 in terms of this whole huge crazy situation everyone's making out with everybody um you know it's。

 you know the girls tits are out I'm stuck in on the girls tits everything well they're all making。

 out with each other um you know it was just it was just this whole like arms and legs everywhere。

 kind of situation pull them back to the apartment um throw on some rion and drake and then everyone。

 has a good time so me like nights like then that was just you know two nights ago so the always。

 the craziest situation that happened the the in the the previous time is always the one that's kind。

 on the forefront of my mind especially when I can bring somebody else into it some other。

 student or some guy that um doesn't have that situation happening all the time for me that's。

 just the normal Wednesday night um so it's always cool to kind of see that kind of that be able to。

 be duplicated and uh you know be passed on kind of um so for me it's it's like you know very few。

 words were spoken in that interaction it was pre so it was massive pre selection massive social。

 proof and aggressive leading and that was it then you can I could teach that to somebody in an hour。

 you know it doesn't it's not that it's not that difficult you don't have to go with this huge round。

 about self-discovery journey to create cool situations like that you could just do a couple。

 of those techniques and and uh and have that kind of fun and then carry it to aggressive three。

 sums and wild times and stories that you know that most people don't have。
