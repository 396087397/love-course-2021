for them to create a win-win situation，then once I made it， I create such a unique， fun situation。

I create such a positive environment of those around me，I have such good energy。

meaning I'll get myself in the DJ booth，I'll get myself into the different tables。

but I do in the table drill，and all the other different table openers that we'll discuss。

over and over again，I'll show you as the examples of，I'll do that to the point where。

and then I'm bringing introducing people， bringing them around me，that everybody that hangs out with。

everyone who knows my first name，created an epic story with myself。

you'll be shocked at the type of bosses that you have， during the day they're super professional。

very straight laced，and then the type of networking that I've done，with guy。

 I mean one of my biggest clients，one of the $3。2 billion tech company。

in a was Sam Mateo or whatever it is，and the way that I was able to， bond with him。

is I showed him how much of a fucking degenerate I am，and he was excited to see it。

and every time we hung with his friends，he was like， or his co-workers or whatever，there's employees。

he was like，you know， these people got to be careful of this or that，you know people trust you。

in a business setting， networking setting，when they tell you hey just so you know。

these people aren't down with it，they're not you know they're not like us。

that's when you've really bonded with somebody，when they introduce you their friends，their family。

their people，and they say oh you know they're，you know just so you know。

they give you a preempt right，they warn you，that's when you know that you've created。

such massive fear missing out，massive stories with between you and them。

when they start to give you that kind of litmus test，the feedback，when they kind of tell you that。

you can hook up with so many girls，that are very very attractive，with piss poor game。

by creating such amazing stories，with their friends of friends，with the people that are around them。

because you create the story，that then gets spread，its cascading game。

regularily I'll have stories that I talk about，that I am a part of，whether its at some after hours。

even a fun way to do it is this，I'm not really a nightclub guy，despite how often I'm in nightclubs。

but I'll take a night I'll be in a nightclub setting，with what kills me this。

i'm not the only one who are business guys，are guys who are nervous about creating and causing a scene。

who then like don't go to nightclubs，because they're nightclub people。

or they'll go in the nightclubs，and then be boring as fuck in those nightclubs，I'll tell you what。

whether I'm in a dental office，whether I'm in an airport，or I'm in a nightclub。

i'm going to be the exciting Luke that I can be，mainly because I'm going to create fear missing out。

not only for other people but for myself as well，which rises in my self esteem。

it rises in my attraction level，it rises everything else that I want，in' in a real-chef success。

so don't think that you can only cause a scene in a social setting，point is this。

no matter whether you're in a shitty dive bar in Wisconsin，or some low-reside bar in New York City。

or Vegas nightclub，create the story with the people that are in your life。

so the first way that I create that story，is by causing the scene。

so step number one of causing that scene，is you amp up the energy。

the first second that you meet them， first way that you do that。

is deciding that you're not going to wait，to build up that energy。

a lot of guys will sit there and be the guy that just sits in the background。

waiting for something to happen，you cannot make an omel without breaking a few eggs。

what you just described as a scene，where you have successful people，successful males，bankers。

investment bankers are a good example，and these investment bankers are doing what they do as you said。

they're having fun，meaning they're probably getting pretty drunk。

they're probably what acting a little bit crazy，and people around them。

maybe don't have the best impression of them，is that accurate？， cool。

they don't give a fuck about the people around them。

because the people around them are not in their circle，they don't give a shit。

because when you start caring about the people that are the onlookers。

when you start caring those people have，you know the reason why they're not having a favorable opinion。

of those investment bankers，and again an investment maker could be one of many many jobs，right？。

but the example you just gave，the investment bankers。

those onlookers don't have a good impression of them，because they're not a part of it。

they have such strong fear of missing out，that they're just jealous that they're not a part of the group。

that's the only reason why，they're jealous that they don't have the money to be at that table。

they're the success or the connections，they're jealous that，and here's the thing。

it's kind of like a guy who sees a girl fucking a bunch of other guys，or several of his friends。

or even just a girl that is flirting with some guy in the club，it's so easy，they're all the time。

they'll call that girl a slut，it's so easy to call a girl a slut，who's not fucking you。

oh that fucking slut，oh that bitch，but she's being flirting with every guy but you。

it's kind of like those investment bankers，who are being friendly with their close group。

and going crazy，but they're not being friendly with the onlookers，right？，that's because they know。

that those people are just jealous，the type of stuff that i do。

i get crazy crazy posts to my snapchat，to text messages to me，of people are just jealous。

that's when you know that you've reached a very good level of fear missing out。

when those people are just so jealous that they're haters，right？，they're drinking the hater aid，ok？。

the more hater aid that you are spewing，the more people are drinking that hater aid。

the better you're doing to create these cool experiences。

yeah these group of guys are achieving success in their daily life，whether it's with tech。

whether it's with investment banking，whether it might be。

and they're having a lot of fun in some nightclub area。

and maybe they're having a little bit too much fun，they're getting a little too crazy。

 a little too belligerent，well，for them to be able to sustain that。

they'll be able to press the reset button，one of my best wings in the world is。

about the best personal injury attorney，and mass tort law，man in the world。

and no matter how crazy he ever gets on one night，right？，and again he's partying with judges。

 lawyers，at a very high level，he's partying with some of the people that。

i've only ever dreamed to know，but he creates such fear of missing out with them。

such crazy experiences，that no matter how nuts it gets，every night he goes out。

there's people judging and hating，in a peripheral circle，looking in。

wishing that they were part of the cool kids，it's so much better to not hate on the cool kids。

just be a part of it，create your own cool kid group，so this guy i regularly all hang out with him。

and，do for my first fears in game，i just want to be the guy that just went in，got the girl left。

i don't want to have to，double with the cool kids，or be popular or worry about that。

so much of game comes down to avoiding groupthink，but when you can master groupthink。

and make it your bitch，then suddenly everyone not only wants you，to be a part of their group。

but you can create your own，it's like not only do，can you get the the comp table。

but people are asking you and begging you，to have your own comp table。

not only are people asking you to，go to their parties，but they're begging you to go to theirs。

so with that investment baking group，or a young professional group，or whatever group that it is。

understand they might have a very boring，daily life，they're letting loose that night。

and just like my buddies，the lawyer，once they hit that recept when they go to bed at night。

they'll wake up the next day，ready to do work and ready to be productive，and professional again。

but they've created that story with their co-workers，they've created that，that type of。

fear missing out that people only here，and only imagine themselves being a part of。

this took me several years to realize，I realize this，you don't have to create a story。

with 4 to 8 hours of a night，everything in game，if you lower your own expectations。

of what the efforts and rewards，are going to be of that technique，or that thing。

the better it's going to be，so for a long time，I thought that，this whole fear missing out thing。

was no no，it's got to be a long night story，we have to go to，after hours，whether it's。

draise or jay guires，or the box in New York，right，we have to do this，epic crazy thing，or。

and SF there's a bunch of after hours places，and it's got to be this，huge， huge elaborate event。

and I started to realize，you know you can do this in one or two，senses。

I started shortening it to like，one liners，I have a bunch of interactions。

where I build this fear of missing out，with people，with just getting，number 1，mastive positive。

affirmation，when you meet somebody，so when you meet somebody，you act extremely exaggerated。

with how cool it is when you meet them，it's worksin a good business，and interpersonal。

and woman getting sense，right，so when you meet somebody，you act like it's，there like you act like。

there a long lost friend，you haven't seen，sense middle school，and you get super excited。

for every single person，that you meet，you are going to feel，mastively fake and confusing，at first。

but once you do it，here's the funny thing about a lot of pick up concepts，they'll feel fake at first。

because you're not used to it，it's not you being fake，it's you're just not used to it。

I'll do this with people，I'm trying to network with business wise，or people I'm trying to get their。

contracts in terms of business，or girls I'm trying to fuck，the second I meet them。

I act very aloof at first，suck into what they're saying，and then，and shocked and surprised。

that they're actually here in front of me，and then I get very very excited，and loud。

given the interaction that's at play，so I'll get introduced to。

so I'll be talking to the first person，I'll get introduced to them。

and then as the introduction happens，most people will go oh hi，I'm Luke，nice to meet you。

or if it's a nightclub，sending maybe they'll go hey，great to meet you。

that might be the most that most people do，I'll open with the break and report。

if it's off the introduction，which you open with a break and report。

if a break and report off the introduction，you end up creating an effect。

where that person will never forget who you are，off that one line，so an example of that is this。

so you're in a setting，you're talking to one person，somebody introduce you to another person。

or you even just approach them，right off the bat，you know they say oh I'm，Jack，go fuck yourself。

go fuck yourself as a break and report，that's very very simple to say。

and it will create such a massive，pattern interrupts that they're going to。

remember you when you create a，pattern interrupts right off the open，right off the bat。

they're going to be excited to see you，this where the irony is this works。

even better in business settings，then it does in interpersonal settings，or so go fuck yourself。

get the fuck out of here，shoot your mouth when you're talking to me，anything like that at all。

the massively sparks that report，that massively creates that，cargdive dissonance，right off the bat。

that's a relative version of creating a，pattern， next thing is using a song lyric，if you can anchor。

you meeting somebody to a very popular song，every time that song comes up。

they're going to realize that they actually，had that story that interaction with you。

they use this all the time，guys and girls，for example let's use a，guys an example，all of the time。

created situation where I'm talking to，somebody when a G easy song will come，and or a fedio，obs。

if you don't like these musicians，if it's nitty and gritty，it's a very very good example。

again this isn't like this is a fear of，missing out in such a case by case basis。

where you don't actually have to have this huge， interaction with them。

but this song when people remember me for years，of just this one，literic transition。

I want to show you guys some situations that，I do you can you can look at my social media。

 and you can see how i create，foMo just off of that and we do the。

social media part of this you'll see that，that's long term fomo。

when you first meet somebody i want you to realize，you have the break heavy breaking rapport。

 which is go fuck yourself right，you don't have to use that exactly that's not a routine。

 that's just an aggressive breaking rapport，another nonverbal one to do is just the old flicker。

 flicker the other person off right when you meet them。

when you first meet somebody just put your finger，right in their face。

the problem with this is if you just stay at that， you can't really trade through the entire conversation。

 what you do is you pull it back， when they say wait what do you say。

 i'm just kidding with you what's your name， i'm luke great to meet you。

 they're so stunned that you do that so quickly， that it creates this story for you and them。

 that they can talk about later， in two sentences without you having to create this huge long story of。

 hang out for hours and hours， then the song lyric is this， when i right now i go meet some cool guy。

 i meet some guy that's a good networking connection， i'm going to say the fedie-wap lyric。

 within a couple sentences of us communicate with each other， i'm going to randomly say。

 oh and i went in your house and i fucked your bitch， and he's gonna look at me like。

 wait what'd you say i go， i'm sorry just nothing you can do about it， which then is a g easy lyric。

 i mean this is what makes， like a lot of the biggest question i ask is。

 like what makes luke luke right， and this is the this is the stuff that makes me me。

 this is the stuff that allows me to have type， of the type of results i get。

 this is what allows you to actually build a network business。

 in a business setting or a business wise and then also， fuck that hot girl at the exact same time。

 at the same damn time， when you're able to do this， it's the confidence that you have by doing this。

 that allows it to work， if you're fidgety and twitching， when you're like。

 i fornicated with your woman， and there's nothing that you can do about it。

 that's not going to work as well， but randomly you're like oh i'm luke。

 oh you jack nice to meet you oh， you're out last last night i fucked your bitch。

 there's nothing you can do about it， or even better bonus points if you look at the。

 his buddy and say oh you jack， gonna meet you oh by the way i fucked his。

 bitch there's nothing you can do about it， they're gonna go wait what。

 and you go i'm just kidding with you i'm， fucking with you the song it's the song。

 anything that's third party third person you can get away with。

 because it's not you actually saying it， so that song comes on that's what it is。

 it's not me actually portraying it or saying it， so then the immediately the reaction back is oh my god。

 i can't believe you said that， haha and now you're in the interaction。

 that's the first step in making a story， causing a scene that normally if you take that out of context。

 about me explaining that that's obnoxious， it's insane why would you ever be able to say that。

 and if you said that without the song playing， that way it wouldn't work as well。

 when you first meet somebody and you treat them， as if they're your long lost friend from middle school。

 right that's like at a maybe a， you know， nine out of ten eight out of ten of。

 energy then max they're going to be able to give you back。

 nine you know eight nine ten out of ten of energy。

 if you go and meet somebody and you give them like a， a limp handshake， right and you。

 give them a four out of ten energy， maximum back to you they're going to give you a three or。

 four out of energy very very rarely are you going to be able to， meet someone and say oh hi i'm。

 i'm Luke nice to meet you， and they're going to go holy shit， that's awesome great to meet you。

 and then create the story for you because the burden。

 of all of this is on yourself once you realize the burden is on you it becomes very very easy。

 whereas instead if you go， Sarah fucking amazing to meet you get the fuck out of here。

 i don't know you the test did not come back， i didn't get a letter from mori get away from me why are you talking to me right now。

 i burn letters from from mori just like i do the irs。

 i put my circular file when it's called the garbage you should you and i should not know each other。

 turn around and get the fuck away from me she's gonna look at you being like wait what the fuck is he saying。

 i'm just kidding come here come here come here give me a big hug come here you're amazing hug gets on the cheek。

 right in two to four sentences 20 seconds， i'm creating an interaction she's never had before rather than just。

 i'd be kicking myself all day if i didn't come over and say hi to you that's why this game works better than a direct style of game。

 when i say it works better i mean works faster gets you hotter girls in a quicker amount of time。

 this will， without a doubt unequivocally get you more attractive women to your life。

 with less approaches than any other style of game。

 because you're creating this story off the first two three four sentences。

 every breaker rapport you give， every story that you do should be kind of handcuffed in the cookie jar。

 one of the biggest connections that michael's ever given me。

 and it's only being materialized in the past couple weeks， you know he values douchebaggery。

 the most douchebag value type thing you can give him。

 i introduced him to three Dallas Mavericks cheerleaders and a couple of cockdwages from Dallas in Las Vegas。

 and， in some other dudes hotel suite， and every person that i'm meeting i make sure in that situation。

 to do a bit of a one two three， a one two three， create a story situation as possible these every every single one of them。

 but i'm saying it with a hand-con the cookie jar expression。

 i'm not saying it with a you know i really had sex with your wife。

 it was when you were at work so there's just nothing that you can actually do about it。

 i went in your house and did it， and i really mean it i'm sorry bro i just。

 i fornicated with your wife it's uh。。。 it's just the situation that we have at hand。

 there's also reverse fear missing out， people are so annoyed that you're the bear of bad news。

 that even if you're correct and factual as us guys like to be。

 it's the inverse the reverse of fear missing out to the point where they're。

 they actually have some negative anchors to you that the stories are so。

 bad they don't want to be around you that you're， the classic example of that is the guy who does the bcc's at work。

 the guy who in a corporate setting bcc's everybody bcc's the boss。

 the guy who bcc the boss send the email and it's just it's very very emotional。

 because it's coming from a very email kind of place。

 that's the type of guy that every time the boss even sees that they're like okay。

 you're clearly just being dramatic and not helping good communication in the workplace。

 if you're bcc and everything same thing with with a lot of women。

 you go on a date and you do the aggressive keynote。

 you're touching on stop that's that's not a good， if you look at it in terms of you have just have full abundance in your life。

 you want to create a story with every single person that you meet you have that full gregariousness。

 then they'll be totally fine long term with the past mistakes。

 meaning the people that are happy with your future gregariousness。

 don't give a shit about people who are upset with you in the past。

 girls who are super super into the fact that i'm willing to。

 in front of anybody pull them to the bar， i was like a Michigan accent there for a second you hear that？

 bar， girls that i will pull to the bar in my buddy's house。

 fuck them outside the bar walk them back in and go eat with everybody else。

 and these are types of girls that are way too hot for me to actually date regularly。

 it's a concept we'll talk about later but these are girls who are way more attractive than you actually date regularly。

 you understand this concept a little bit i think， we'll be talked about fuck them send them right back in。

 or video shoot go back to whatever thing that we're doing， go back to our social setting。

 send them with a bosses or people like that， guys who are in a career authority positions with you。

 the more that you can be the gregariousness with them。

 show that gregariousness and not actually care what those results are going to be。

 then you might fuck up a little bit you might burn a couple bridges。

 but it's not a zero sum game meaning that the people who do fall within your gregariousness trap more。

 than you can be obnoxious gregarious the more times that you can overstep your bounds。

 as simple like to put it the more feedback that you're going to get the more intuitive you'll be。

 so when you actually do have that business situation that occurs you actually are with that。

 perfect 10 that you're trying to hook up with， she won't look back at your past and discretion and say。

 oh yeah well you were really uncalibrated a year ago six months ago。

 no do you want to get that girl or are you trying to get the girl tonight， that's the solid seven。

 no if you're after that amazing business contract you're after that amazing girl that you're trying to pick up。

 and you're okay with it being 90 days from now you know it just 90 days that's it。

 I'm not even saying like a year or two years of personal development I'm just saying。

 give it two weeks go 13 14 days of being gregarious of being aggressive。

 being overstepping your bounds right of creating such situations with people。

 that their borderline offended or their bit touchy。

 do that and watch the types of people that do come into your life once you're done with it。

 because it's not a zero sum game they won't judge you for it they won't look look good。

 don't judge you for it they won't look look down on you for you creating those。

 kinds of stories with every girl that you approach。

 you want to be the guy that is the tightrope for her to walk on。

 but also provide the emotional net in case she falls。

 so the best mindsets you can have for women you want to be so crazy， so fucking nuts。

 wake the fuck up， that you're the guy who will fuck her in public you're the guy that will。

 be so crazy that after 30 minutes of knowing her， she'll think about you forever that's that tightrope。

 but you're also willing to be that net underneath to catch her just in case。

 things get too wild or rightly or rightly or crazy。

 understand that's kind of like the group you just described。

 you want to be the crew that is willing to fuck shit up but then when no one's looking。

 when you break the lamp you break them off and you take care of the guy who owned the lamp。

 you want to be so fucking nuts that you and your friends can get into crazy trouble。

 but you already have， I'm have a group of guys that are like this right they taught me to do this。

 they actually did it for me where they're so crazy that they have lawyers on retainer。

 just in case they do such stupid shit， or you ever see nightclub security that's private security for like one table or one group of people。

 that's security is for that those that group those people。

 that security is not for everybody else it's not to look cool。

 Justin Bieber's head security guard is to make sure Justin Bieber。

 doesn't get into a fight himself Justin Bieber's security may weather security。

 that's to make sure that may weather doesn't lose some contract because he's fighting with somebody in a club。

 you're going to create as much of a setup in your life where you're continually。

 and create a cascading effect of that tightrope with that net underneath， my best friend Mr。

 Saw's enough， he creates a situation where he has no judgment of any girl or any guy what they do。

 he wants him to get lit and get party and get a party atmosphere。

 but then he's the one who will be the designated driver 100% of the time。

 that creates that tightrope of party no judgment fun。

 creates that story but then everybody knows that you know。

 we can go crazy because we have a designated driver all of the time。

 he's 100% not going to drink even if we paid him or forced him to。

 maybe that doesn't need a driver that's that crazy atmosphere。

 with that net underneath to make sure that person's safe and。

 and okay creating an event or a container is one of the easiest ways。

 to create that setup where people have foam or fear missing out。

 the easiest way to do that is just have a theme， a white party a pink party go a little bit further and label it something。

 mean girls party the one that you went to the other night where we brought。

 and I the Owen pulled from that party， first set that Owen pulled。

 for first set that Owen opened he pulled mainly because he was thrown， that girl was thrown at it。

 you want to create a container， even if you have no money。

 even if you have no friends nothing going on， you have to create some sort of container。

 because what this container will do is will bring people into your life and create that foam or whether they go to it or not。

 I like to create such an aggressive container， that 80% of people I invite to this or。

 the cold approaches that I do， I'll tell them hey we have this thing coming up this weekend。

 you want to increase your cold approach game， by double quadruple even。

 have some thing that you're inviting every girl to。

 rather than just saying oh you want to grab drinks some time。

 you know what are you doing later tonight， you going to some nightclub， you want to grab sushi。

 have a regular scheduled programming， happening have some thing that's going to happen with or without her。

 and you know what this thing is going to happen with or without you。

 sometimes you'll even see it。
