# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：2. 内心游戏：2.自尊与自信

每明期我面团节起漏壽司，习命，对我在本 top social media，把所有种类传期动力， golden that's one thing，那这一部分是关系 realm， beloved。

我的 свed，感情短暗，谡量我，有水悲，做我做过现在的，我们也非常尽力，啊， 我都是感情短暗，其他部分，一定没有， And that cities are pretty important， jix。

self-esteem is really a deep level of confidence，what guys will ask me regularly is。

look how do you have such strong self-confidence，and the question is a very simple question but the answer can be very complex。

 the answer that I first started giving guys and the first kind of came to me。

 isn't as correct as what I have formulated now， what you have to understand is confidence and self-esteem is extremely deep rooted。

 we can't just trick ourselves we can't accidentally have strong confidence or self-esteem。

 in fact it's so categorized that the way that you develop confidence。

 is you develop confidence in specific skill sets and areas of your life。

 take your ability to tie your shoes for example， my ability to tie my shoes is so confident。

 I have such high self-esteem in that regard， that I don't really think about it in a case by case basis。

 I don't every time I tie my shoes each morning， I don't really think about how I feel about tying my shoes。

 I'm so competent in that area that I can just tie my shoes really without looking at my feet。

 driving is another example are you more confident behind the wheel now than you were at 15 or 16 years old。

 of course and that's because competence breeds confidence。

 more competent you are in something the more confident you'll end up being。

 confidence ends up being exuded into self-esteem， the more self-esteem that you have and the more rock-stallowed that self-esteem is。

 the less negative issues are going to creep into your life。

 and the more positive of a life you're going to live。

 self-confidence self-esteem stretches far beyond pickup。

 stretches far beyond your ability to see that girl that you like。

 and approach that girl and seduce and win her over and date that girl。

 self-esteem and self-confidence is really a lifelong journey and goal。

 for you being extremely satisfied with yourself from the core from the inside out。

 I'm going to go through a bunch of different ways for you to increase your self-confidence。

 and to really identify what your level of confidence currently is and how to measure it。

 the theme that you're going to notice throughout the social circle blueprint。

 is this if you can't measure it you can't improve it。

 I'm going to show you the nitty gritty details of pickup。

 the nitty gritty details of confidence building， the brass tax feet on the ground examples and anecdotes of how you actually get。

 success with women of how you actually increase your confidence。

 you actually increase your self-esteem rather than having fleeting self-esteem。

 in the moment that comes and goes， most guys tackle self-esteem confidence building in completely the wrong way。

 they tackle it in a case by case subject by subject basis。

 this is the wrong way because you want to make sure that when you increase。

 your self-esteem that every morning when you wake up。

 you're actually improving your overall self-esteem。

 your core level of self-esteem that you know that you're on the road。

 that you're on the track to being that guy， you might not be there yet each day that passes。

 it might not seem as fast as it could be or as fast as you want it to be。

 but each day that passes if you follow everything that I'd lay out for you。

 in the social circle blueprint and specifically in the self-esteem building and confidence building section。

 you're going to realize that every day you're increasing your core level of self-esteem。

 an amazing thing's happened after you increase that core level of self-esteem。

 you'll realize that you're able to achieve much greater things than you were to。

 able to achieve before， you're going to start realizing once you have higher self-esteem。

 that your status naturally increases， that you'll naturally start building more social proof。

 pre-selection will be a lot easier， and you're just going to draw much higher quality people into your life。

 because what ends up happening is this， when you have a low self-esteem you just attract low self-esteem people。

 but when you take all the concepts that we're going to discuss and how to raise your core level of self-esteem。

 then it's a much more natural process， you don't actually have to try to build that self-esteem when you go out。

 quite regularly guys will ask me， hey Luke how do I get into state。

 and that question is a really interesting question， because just the nature of asking。

 how do I get into state， it immediately takes you off the track。

 of being somebody who's in good state all the time， don't get me wrong。

 I am definitely somebody who wakes up on the wrong side of the bed in the morning。

 I definitely have my good days and bad days， that being said I will never let my internal feelings。

 I will never let my physiology affect my results， however when you increase your physiology when you increase your core level of self-esteem。

 your results will always be higher， but you have the choice。

 the choice is 100% within you to let a negative self-esteem。

 negative confidence situation affect your results in a positive or negative way。

 what I'm after every time I put any amount of money， time。

 any other bit of investment into something， I'm after a specific and direct result。

 I'm not after wishy washy potential grey area kind of feelings。

 when you focus on questions like how do I get into state， how do I improve my mood。

 when you start realizing this， it doesn't actually yield you a better result that day。

 it's just kind of like a drug， it's kind of like when you buy a treadmill。

 studies show that when you buy a treadmill， you actually get the exact same feelings as if you were to get into shape。

 studies show that every time you buy an exercise magazine。

 you're actually going through the exact same mental motions。

 and physiological changes of if you were to go run。

 there's no real way to increase your state in a case by case basis。

 instead what you want to do is you want to focus on this。

 the main core part of building your self-esteem， building your confidence is this。

 whatever it is that you feel like you should be doing。

 that's the thing that you should do in that exact moment。

 a lot of guys feel like they could take this kind of too far。

 but this has been the number one factor， in increasing my self-esteem and confidence。

 and really my overall satisfaction with my life， at every point in the day I do exactly what it is。

 that Luke wants to do， now that definitely comes to bite me sometimes。

 but I learn from it and move forward， but I always am able to look at myself。

 think inward and realize I'm doing exactly what it is that I want to be doing。

 now when you stop and think about that for a second。

 when you make that choice over and over and over again。

 to always decide that you're going to take the action that is what you want to do for yourself。

 despite the consequences， despite the negativity from people around you。

 over time not a lot of time， over a small period of time that ends up actually increasing your self-esteem dramatically。

 because it shows that you're taking control of not only your daily life。

 but you're taking control over how you're going to feel about certain situations。

 but any situation that comes up， most people want to look for a quick fix to increase their state。

 what's the random self-immuniciment thing that they can do， what's the joke that they can tell。

 what's the thing that they can do to increase their state。

 the quicker that they increase their state， the quicker it will decrease。

 whereas when you increase your baseline level of self-confidence and self-esteem。

 by doing everything that it is that you actually want to be doing at all times。

 and the other techniques that we're going to go through in the self-esteem module。

 you're going to realize that each day you can measure a increase in your overall self-esteem。

 rather than it being a vague verbose type of concept， when people talk about self-esteem。

 originally when I first heard about self-esteem， it was when I was a child and we。

 I think I overheard different parents， either parents of my friends or my own parents talking about different kids self-esteem。

 in that moment I realized that self-esteem was this thing that people like to bestow upon other people。

 you like to look at your friends and say， oh that person is more confident than I am or less confident than I am。

 or they're jacks more confident than Tim or vice versa。

 the reason we like to do that is our ego gets in the way， and it causes us to have to make these。

 assertations that causes us to have to make these decisions。

 whereas instead if we realize that we're all on this forward momentum progression。

 to just increase our overall self-esteem， you're going to have a lot more success。

 when you decide that self-esteem is should be what you're after。

 not state self-esteem implies and creates this concrete deep rooted level of confidence。

 when you take the social circle blue protagonics， when you take all the techniques and formulas and anecdotes and examples that I show you for different items in the social circle blueprint。

 you'll notice that every single one of them increases your self-esteem， increases your confidence。

 whereas if you just try to increase your state， or you just tell yourself that certain outside factors don't matter。

 or it's not about actually changing that physiology。

 when you're going to notice this when you do take all those techniques and put them into practice。

 when you do take all of the concepts that we talk about in the 9-10 game section。

 about how to get 9s and 10s about the different fear of missing out experience sections。

 what you're going to notice is all of the tangible and actionable techniques that you employ。

 that you create into a habit for yourself， that you make intuitive and intuition about these correct habits。

 what you're going to notice is that your self-esteem not only rises but it's fairly measurable。

 you're going to notice that each day each week you actually have more self-esteem that's not fleeting。

 even if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed that morning and you're just pissed off。

 you're going to notice that you do have this sense of self-esteem that really is a very competent based self-esteem。

 a competent based self-esteem is where you just know what to do even if you're not feeling particularly up to it that day。

 an example would be you know that you want to go meet some girl this weekend。

 Friday rolls around all of a sudden you realize you're in a really bad mood for whatever reason。

 it's a boss situation a family member maybe just got dumped you got you know you had a big break up。

 whatever might be your competence is what should power you through your competence is what should give you。

 the self-esteem in order to have success competence in a certain area competence in the skill set。

 all of a sudden increases that self-esteem despite you having a bad day。

 just the other day actually I had a really bad day and there was no real reason why。

 it's pretty average day but I had a bad day and for about half the day I let it stop me。

 I let it affect things I was doing but what I decided to do is realize that I actually had a list of things that just needed to happen。

 they need to occur I need to accomplish them and when I decided and realized that I had the competence to actually achieve those tasks。

 the items on that list then suddenly I dug deep and realized that I did have the self-esteem or to accomplish it。

 and then once I actually accomplished the items on that list I actually crushed those things。

 suddenly my self-esteem also kept increasing so what you want to really focus on is this。

 create this hearted effect to your self-esteem you don't want to be the egg that you just cracks and all of a sudden you crumble。

 and you just leak everywhere your confidence your self-esteem really what you're driving for is a very slow and steady increase in that self-esteem。

 because when it's slow and steady no one can take that away from you just like the other parts of games。

 specifically sociological game nobody can take that away from you nobody can take those introductions away from you。

 nobody can take this skill so away from you just like this nobody can take the self-esteem away from you。

 when you have that rock solid self-esteem every time you go up to check in at a hotel。

 the person who's checking you into that hotel will recognize that you have such solid self-esteem that you don't have to try to have entitlement。

 you don't have to try to have it a abundant mentality。

 when you have that much self-esteem they just recognize that they just bestow those traits upon you。

 they have that characteristic for you already， you're going to notice that they're going to give you complimentary upgrades that you're going to get comp bottles at nightclubs。

 that you're going to get complimentary dinners that you're going to have people throwing girls at you。

 purely because of your self-esteem alone， each part of the sociological blueprint works if you don't take any other part and take action on it。

 if you just take the self-esteem section you're going to notice that you're going to have people in your life。

 just creating the you army without you actually creating the you army。

 you're going to notice that people are just throwing value at you because your self-esteem is in fact that high。

 that solid， that unbreakable， when you have that high self-esteem something as simple as checking into a hotel。

 you're going to notice that you're going to get complimentary upgrades without you even questioning it。

 without you even asking， you're going to notice that girls that you're introduced to will suddenly just give you a little bit more indicators of interest。

 they're suddenly going to be more into you because you have that high self-esteem。

 common theme that you're going to notice as you go through the sociological blueprint is that every single lesson。

 task that I show you， is something that I specifically have done in my eight years of teaching game。

 everyone is on a quest for state building everyone's on a quest to feel good， to be happy。

 to be content， what you want to do is you want to stay away from these vague verbose words and instead to keep your feet on the ground。

 focus on the brass tax of what's actually going to get your results。

 when you focus on specific tangible lessons that actually get your results that are measurable。

 this isn't to say you're going to get results 100% of the time but when you focus on increasing your self-esteem in a pragmatic way。

 in a very objective kind of way then what you do is you end up making something as ubiquitous as emotions。

 and you make them containable you categorize them in such a way where you can actually improve them。

 too often people like to use subjective terms for emotions because it's easier。

 it's a lot easier to just say that you're feeling good or bad。

 it's a lot easier to say that you're feeling better or worse or that you're in a good state or bad state。

 really what is it's a sign of a deep down more rooted issue or cause。

 it's not really just a fleeting emotion， if you're somebody who is even willing to say that you're in bad state。

 what ends up happening is you realize that deep down you just don't have the self-esteem core。

 that other people have or that you see some guys having or that you could have。

 the way that I learned proper self-esteem and confidence building is through a massive amount of quantity。

 you're going to notice that you can in fact get quality through quantity。

 because the quantity gives you such strong reference experience。

 such strong anecdotal experience and even more than that the quantity itself。

 will just instill in you positive traits， lessons and actual tangible things for you to do。

 when you instill those actionable tangible things for you to do to take action on。

 you build that skill set， you build your tool kit up， you have that emotional toolbox with you。

 suddenly your self-esteem goes up and up and up despite different things that happen to you。

 despite a door guy not letting you into a nightclub， despite a girl rejecting you。

 your self-esteem is so high that it can take any of those hits。

 self-esteem is not something that came natural to me。

 self-esteem and confidence were two of my biggest and strongest weak points。

 when I first learned about personal development， lifestyle redesign， game。

 I had one area that I was confident in before game。

 and that one area in all honesty I really wasn't as confident I thought I was。

 I was just a lot younger than my peers， so my age combined with me knowing a decent amount about that subject。

 gave me a bit of an inflated sense of confidence， that could be punctured almost the way a balloon could be punctured with a needle。

 you might have parts of your life where you feel like you're confident。

 but perhaps people in your life think you're maybe more confident about that。

 than you even know that you're confident about that subject topic， skill set。

 an example of that is career before game I was extremely confident in my career。

 but I didn't exactly have high self-esteem for my career because I always。

 kind of knew that I took a different process in learning the skill set that I knew。

 it was a process that even though I got a strong result。

 I really kind of relied on the fact that I was younger than everybody else。

 in order to create my self-esteem， so it was really a strong ego protection。

 my very first boot camp I ever took， I remember I was shocked at how bad I actually was。

 now I was a virgin at the time but because I had a few strong points。

 and other parts of my life you might even have a very similar situation。

 where you're actually talented at a certain skill that you have。

 or you have certain eptan that you work or competence in another area of your life。

 you know you know a lot of facts about something， but then all of a sudden you try to go meet women。

 you're gonna notice that a lot of those confidence points and self-esteem points are sucked out of you。

 really without warning， that's really what happened to me I took my very first boot camp。

 and I just had this massive approaching anxiety， and it's not like I hadn't talked to people before。

 it's not like I didn't have a decent sense of self-worth and self-esteem。

 but what I did realize it was actually hiding， I was actually bearing a lot of my biggest fears。

 and frustrations I was bearing them for a very long time。

 which then gave me this sense of confidence， we're gonna realize through social circle blueprint is that。

 it's a sense of confidence or it's a core grounded sense of self-esteem。

 you can't have both you have to really let go， you have to cut that imbiltical core to this ego protective sense of confidence。

 and really strive for that core level confidence core level self-esteem。

 so on that first boot camp I took， I remember I was just floored I was shocked at how terrible my opening was。

 I couldn't come up with anything to save right off the bat to any girl， any guy let alone a female。

 and then I remember this one key moment is， on the Sunday of that program I got my first number close。

 I got a first contact details of a girl my entire life。

 and I realized that it wasn't the best phone number close。

 she wasn't my exact ideal girl but what I realized is that I had control over what happened。

 and all of a sudden guess what happened to myself a steam， myself a steam skyrocketed。

 it skyrocketed because I now realize that even if I'm not at the level of。

 game or persuasion or lifestyle design that I want to be at。

 the fact that I was able to get her phone number and I wasn't able to several days earlier。

 before I took my boot camp， that told me that I'm on the right path。

 it told me that I made the right decision to buy that boot camp。

 I made the right decision to go down this rabbit hole。

 and I knew that if I kept going down that rabbit hole， new accolades of self-esteem。

 new personal interpersonal accolades would happen。

 and what ends up happening is you get this significant uplift of confidence。

 because you're now in control， you now have the control to create options in your life。

 which really is what game is all about， it's really what most lifestyle redesign aspects are about。

 it's creating more options in your life that you can pick and choose。

 that life doesn't happen to you， you are in control of your own life。

 everything you do to increase your self-esteem， it doesn't have to have these rollercoaster highs and lows。

 it doesn't have to be these defibrillator shots of self-esteem， that's where state goes wrong。

 when you're trying to improve your state， you really focus on the short bursts of confidence。

 the short bursts of self-esteem， when in reality when you just increase that self-esteem。

 slowly but surely each day， each night that you go out。

 the ones that are happening is you don't have to have these large bursts。

 you just can roll with the punches of any sort of negativity that comes your way。

 it doesn't mean that negativity doesn't happen， it just means that you're able to address the negativity。

 you're able to address any sort of critical objective， negative thing that comes into your life。

 either from another person or self-inflicted， and then you're able to actually convert that into positivity throughout your day。

 and that's where having that strong self-esteem base comes from。

 that's what you can get out of that， a lot of guys think that they can get self-esteem。

 through purely outer-game specific situations that occur to them。

 there's definitely some truth to that， every positive situation that happens to you。

 you'd be lying to yourself if you said that， that wasn't increasing your self-esteem or your confidence。

 but you do have to be careful， because every time that you increase your self-esteem。

 based on something that's outside your control， outside your factor， then it's less concrete。

 the self-esteem isn't quite as solid， one way that I'm going to show you to increase your self-esteem。

 is to be outcome-dependent， to look at the other side of the coin， to have tangible objective goals。

 metrics， not to the point where you are obsessive-compulsive about it。

 but to the point where you actually know， each week are you getting better with your game。

 are you getting worse with your game， each week are you lying to yourself。

 are you potentially getting results， despite your game or because of your game。

 when you actually look at the mirror and take a really honest look at， how much you're progressing。

 suddenly it gets very frustrated， it gets very disappointing at first。

 you might go two steps forward one step backward， but you'll still be going two steps forward。

 it's really one of the best ways to increase your self-esteem。

 because you're actually taking an honest look at yourself， rather than sugar-coating things。

 a lot of guys choose to sugar-coat their results， they sugar-coat their progress。

 if you want to actually get results， you want to get those 9s and 10s。

 that I'll talk about in the other module， you want to get the type of girl you're after。

 if you really want to get the type of girl， that messes you up that got you into game。

 and persevered in the first place， you want to get your ex back。

 or maybe you want to have your ex regret， ever leaving you in the first place。

 then you're going to realize that these tangible skill sets。

 the stuff that I'm going to show you the toolbox， that I'm going to construct just for you。

 is exactly what's necessary to build up your self-esteem。

 I'm going to show you how to build up your self-esteem， even if you're overweight。

 you have bad style， maybe you have a bad beard， or you have a skin issue。

 or you have some sort of other physical ailment deformity。

 problem that is one of your biggest insecurities or weaknesses。

 I'm going to go through an entire inner comfort checklist， that you can do just for yourself。

 you don't have to share with anybody， that will literally show you exactly。

 what you're most insecure about， whether you know it or not。

 and it will show you how to actually turn that into a strong point。

 it will show you how to turn your strongest insecurities， into your strongest points of confidence。

 the way most guys go through their life， is they take their insecurities and they cover them up somehow。

 they cover them up with the way they act， the way they address the different career choices that they make。

 they cover up all their insecurities， when instead if you look at your insecurities right in the mirror。

 and you welcome your insecurities， you acknowledge them。

 what ends up happening is you're able to actually get past them。

 in a productive way where you increase your self-esteem。

 you increase that confidence with all those insecurities， having to creep in。

 it's exceptionally easy to have high self-esteem， when you're making the kind of income that you expect to be making。

 when you're in the physical physique that you expect to have， when your style is on point。

 when you have a strong social circle already， when you have girls that are already clamoring to have your attention。

 it's very easy to have high self-esteem， but can you have high self-esteem when all that gets taken away from you。

 can you have high self-esteem when you are perhaps a bit out of shape。

 maybe a lot more than a bit out of shape， when you're on unemployment and you're in between jobs。

 when you're friends for some reason decided to call you less。

 when all these other outside factors happen， can you still have an immense high self-esteem。

 that's when you have a unshakeable， completely unbreakable self-esteem。

 there's going to be lots of different ways both inward and outward。

 that I'm going to show you in order to increase your baseline level of self-esteem， take both。

 realize there's a balance， you might find yourself enjoying the inner self-esteem exercises。

 and techniques a lot more than the outer game techniques and exercises， or vice versa。

 maybe you'll enjoy the actual examples， the tangible examples， of building up your self-esteem。

 either way realize it's a balance， it's a back and forth， when you do both。

 when you realize that sometimes doing the thing that you don't want to do the most。

 that that's actually what's going to help you the most achieve the most results。

 then you end up getting motivated to take that action。

 every time that you meet up with another social circle blueprint member。

 every time that you go through the other modules of the social circle blueprint。

 keep in mind what is the action that you could take to increase your self-esteem。

 because it rubs off on everybody， the more self-esteem that you have。

 though higher status your self-esteem the easier all the other techniques are going to be。

 throughout the rest of the social circle blueprint always realize and understand。

 how can that concept that I'm demonstrating for you that I'm showing you。

 how can that increase your self-esteem because the more self-esteem that you have。

 the higher status your self-esteem is， the more of a badass that you actually are。

 and that you recognize that you are， the easier everything else will be。

 when you're in a group of people and you have high self-esteem。

 your joke doesn't need to be quite as funny， your energy doesn't have to be quite as high。

 because the self-esteem gets carried over to them。

 they'll recognize that you're somebody of self-worth and of value， that they'll want in their life。

 they'll realize that you're somebody that they can actually， soak up some value arbitrage from。

 that you actually could be a potential connector， rather than somebody who sulk and sinks in their own self-pity。

 nobody wants to be around that， it's not about faking it till you make it。

 but it is about setting yourself up to succeed， you have to stack the deck in your favor。

 the house always wins， so what you have to do is realize that， self-esteem is a challenging thing。

 you can't just out-emotion your way into high self-esteem。

 you have to create these logical categories， you have to create these patterns。

 these habits in your life， that prove to you over and over again， that you are the f***ing man。

 that you are a badass， that you do deserve all the results in the rewards。

 and the women and the life experiences， that you always knew that you deserved。

 but you have to take action， you have to take massive action。

 you have to do everything that I'm going to lay out for you， in order to have that high self-esteem。

 or it's just not going to happen for you， the crazy thing is this。

 I believe in every single one of my clients， every single person that I've taught。

 these social circle blueprint concepts too， in person， I've believed in every single one of them。

 more than they've actually believed in themselves， and that's because I can take somebody and see。

 where they could go， a lot easier than they can actually see it themselves， even you。

 I can see exactly how far， you can take these concepts。

 exactly how many quality friends you could put in your life， exactly what type of real solid 8， 9。

 10， that you could be dating， sleeping with， exactly what type of entrepreneurial effort that you could succeed with。

 I can see that because I can see the potential， that's inside of you。

 as long as you actually had the self-esteem to back it up， if you're the self-esteem to back up。

 your work ethic， to match up your to your ambition， the sky's the limit。

 you would be going to place it， it would be impossible for you to not be going to。

 high status award shows， high status nightclubs，， high status restaurants， whatever the thing is。

 that is of high value and high status to you， you would almost be more work for you to not do those things。

 once you complete the social circle blueprint， you're going to realize that it's actually more work。

 to not get your 9 or 10， it's actually more work to not hang out with。

 the cool guys that you've always wanted to hang out with。

 it's more work to not feel good about yourself all the time。

 and then once you stack the deck in your favor， by making it more work to not do those things。

 suddenly your life just becomes this continual flow， of amazing experiences， beautiful women。

 and everything else that you ever knew you deserved。

 once you understand how important your own confidence， your own self-esteem is。

 and how critical your level of self-esteem is to your success， with women， with your career。

 and the entrepreneurial efforts， your networking， epic experiences that you have。

 once you realize how significant of an impact， that your self-esteem has on your life。

 is very clear that that's the route you should take。

 you should really put a concert effort into developing。

 that self-esteem and really treating it like a muscle， not like an accidental afterthought。

 when you treat your self-esteem and your confidence building， like a muscle you work it every day。

 it's a prescription that you take each day， it's not something that accidentally happens。

 or something that's inadvertent， it's obvious that having strong self-esteem。

 a high level of self-confidence， is going to help you achieve all the results， that you're after。

 it's going to help you seduce the girl that you're trying to hook up with。

 it's going to help you get that X back， it's going to help you get a promotion at work。

 in fact you're going to realize how powerful self-esteem is， and having that core confidence。

 when you notice that these accolades and these cool things， just happen to you randomly。

 and you didn't really do anything differently， you just have this new confident， high self-esteem。

 high status， aura around you， and other people not only do they sense it。

 but it causes a lot of pressure inside of them， to then do things for you。

 to then be a part of your life， the easiest way to increase your confidence in your self-esteem。

 is to look at the other side of the coin of outcome dependence。

 traditionally we don't want to have outcome dependence， because it will put us in our head。

 it will bog us down， it will slow our progress down， it will create a situation in an environment。

 where you're not going to have as much success， however， the other side to that coin。

 is knowing what you're after， being very specific， authentic to what you're trying to achieve。

 and knowing that you have the ability， that you have the skill set， you have the tools。

 to create consistent results for yourself， once you're able to create consistent results for yourself。

 you'll notice that your self-esteem and your confidence， skyrockets， it will almost be immeasurable。

 your confidence will go through the roof， and levels that you never could have imagined。

 purely because of this one word， and that one word is consistency， there's a lot of guys out there。

 that hook up with a lot of really attractive girls， but a lot most of those guys。

 a lot of them just aren't consistent， they're still kind of pissing the wind or grasping for straws。

 the real way to increase your self-esteem， and your self-worth and your confidence。

 is to have consistent results， over time having a pattern。

 because what this does is it reinforces in your mind。

 that you are deserving of the results that you're getting， if your results come sporadic。

 they come off the cuff， they're random， you don't feel as deserving of those results。

 you don't necessarily deserve a 9 or 10 right now， because if you did deserve her。

 you would have her in your life， but that doesn't mean that you don't deserve her one day。

 but you got to actually put those things in place， something has to tick。

 you either need to be using your game， you need to be using， some guys use looks， some guys use。

 they try to use money to get girls， if you're going to use your personality。

 you need to put an aggressive approach， a tenacious approach， into increasing your self-esteem。

 and not just relying on the fact that you're kind of okay， there's five levels of content。

 when you're at the lowest level of content， you're the most likely person to actually achieve success。

 because you're coming from such a low place， whereas if you're coming from a place of high content。

 you're coming from a place of abundance already， you're not as likely to improve。

 you're not as likely to make strides in your progress， because you don't need to。

 you're already content， it's that middle ground that you kind of， have to be especially careful of。

 where you're getting decent results with girls， but it's not consistent。

 because what that's going to do is it's going to cloud your mind， it's going to tell you that。

 hey you know what you're actually good， when in fact you might not be， it's going to tell you that。

 you're funny in situations when you aren't， just because you're at that three or four level of content。

 that three or four level of content， is the type of guy who probably got his college degree。

 maybe it was in a frat， maybe it was another student organization。

 got a job in some decent metropolitan area， has a few social circles。

 and every once in a while randomly， goes home with some girl。

 that's the type of guy who's a lot less likely to， try to learn gay and try to better himself。

 this exact way that you're better in yourself， that guy is a lot less likely to。

 increase his status and increase his， success with women， because he isn't coming from his。

 painful place， if you're coming from a place of， just as much pain as I'm coming from。

 you're going to skyrocket your results， they'll be extremely measurable。

 and they'll be kind of spooky， how aggressive your confidence becomes。

 to the point where you'll actually go through the。

 arrogance phase you'll have so much confidence that。

 you're just completely going around any negativity， from that overinflated confidence。

 because the confidence you're getting， will match up with the results that you're getting。

 so it won't be for nothing， you'll actually have real tangible self-esteem。

 that's based on anecdotes， it's based on numbers， it's based on something you've actually gone through。

 the worst that you can have is confidence， based on pure affirmation alone。

 I'm going to discuss with you a lot of ways， that you can gain confidence。

 in self-esteem with positive， affirmations by doing a lot of， inner work。

 but the way that you can gain， consistent confidence， is by having consistent results。

 you have those consistent results， by doing some of the core， fundamentals of the social。

 blueprint I accidentally found my， self-confidence I accidentally found my self-esteem。

 I never really looked at myself as a guy， who had high self-esteem or， high level of confidence。

 until， tens or maybe even， hundreds of guys kept coming up to me， and asking me about it。

 and the reason why I didn't really notice it， or think about it at first is when I。

 realized and I decided that game， that persuasion。

 that human psychology is something I wanted to focus my efforts on， lifestyle redesign。

 then I realized the fact that， I don't really want to have time。

 to think about emotions that could be negative for me， or that could slow my progress down。

 so instead I filled up my entire time， gaming， studying， focusing on leveling up。

 and then eventually， I learned confidence and self-esteem along the way， my technical ability。

 was always further， than my inner game was， my inner game was always kind of。

 catching up to my outer game results， and that actually， catapulted my confidence。

 despite what a lot of people， would say， it catapulted my confidence， because I was always seen。

 what type of lifestyle， that a guy with high confidence was living。

 because I was living that lifestyle， despite me being a few stages back， in the confidence area。

 so all that I had to do was keep going， keep aggressively approaching， changing up my goals。

 dating more attractive women， higher status women， women that were open to， being bisexual。

 women that were open to having other women， in their relationship。

 open to meeting women that had a very， aggressive career ambitions。

 just aggressively tackling my dating life， then there was also the guy aspect。

 so much of this comes down to， not only just being the guy that every girl wants。

 but being the guy that every guy wants to be， it's kind of ironic， one of the pivotal moments。

 that motivated me and got me excited， about lifestyle redesign， learning how to seduce women。

 is this article that I read， when I was really young， in Maxime magazine about。

 how to be that type of guy， the article was literally， something like that guy。

 and in the article it kept reiterating the point， of being the guy that， all girls want to be with。

 but also it's important to be the guy， that all other guys want to be。

 and that's super critical to me， because at a certain point。

 you have all the girls that you can have， about nine months into game， I reached a level success。

 that was higher than what my original goal was， when I took my very first boot camp in the first place。

 so when you look at， the rabbit hole that is， personal development， psychology。

 learning all these different techniques， the women aspect is actually a small。

 percentage of the overall picture， when you meet other， other people who are， trying to find a guy。

 or perhaps even guys， that could be mentors of yours， guys that are， more advanced career path。

 guys that are dating the exact， type of girl that you're after， guys that are doing。

 exact things with their lifestyle， that you want to be doing， that will catapult your success。

 with women even further than， just focusing on those。
