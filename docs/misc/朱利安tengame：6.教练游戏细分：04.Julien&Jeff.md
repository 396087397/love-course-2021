# 朱利安ten game：6.教练游戏细分：04. Julien & Jeff

我才會說，我剛好，不太喜歡， da)(h test signal，Gethness of it all，You know what I mean？。

I never wanted to be a poor man，S this or a poor man's mystery。

or poor man's style or anything like that，Yeah，You know I used things like say Dacube， Yeah。

I do remember if you remember what that is，But you know I used to shit like that。

But it was always colored，By my own personality，I don't know if that's because of like narcissism。

Because I had just had an inherent belief that，If I brought my own twist to it，It would be better。

 I can do better than this，You know what I mean， 와這是專業，應該要參數拯救，我有同樣的表明，就是說，我是即已至他等他，我不知道我等他一天。

可是你到底是 besides，如果你有用的帖子，或者你把自己的帖子，把自己的帖子，把自己的帖子，你会不会负责，你会不会负责，只要有一个半个帖子，然后，你会不会负责，因为你会不会负责，因为你会不会负责。

你会不会负责，或者你会不会贪om，我感觉说，我感受到， furniture， furniture， furniture， representa，这些颜色，我就会看到这些颜色，这是一种手法的。

一个 thee，包ünd羞，很甜，这个其他変更的，让我为你们去答应，你可以选择，你有住的地方，你心里，要和喝，到每個人贪富，我看到有 expose，她要和在父親去，火灯是几个问题，通过人外警生。

我在意味着，一个大 рас住，不同人在钉头里，这些ips是小 obstruction，柔性凶，找家人和长官，要先家陋，进行一个简单，已经刷成她的身体，然后你知道，她的身体呐。

Hey Hello My Island Hello My Baby，Yeah，Yeah，Like this little vaudeville act。

Now it's a lot more grounded，It's like，Yeah，Here it is bitch，Do you like it？，If you don't，I，Sori。

And as Canadians might say，Sori，I don't know what to tell you，Have a great night。

So the thing is what I realized，Is that when you are coming from that place of authenticity。

It is kind from that place of，Your sense of humor，Your unique approach，Your unique。

Take on everything，That，That's when you are going to，Like when the girl is attracted to that。

The attraction is going to be 10 times more powerful，Then，If it was you are like。

You biting someone style，Like Jeffie style， Julian style， whatever，Because。

Again it's rooted in authenticity，Right，And when you，And again you might have to talk to 10 girls。

And to find that，As opposed to like，You talk to 3 girls，And they are all giggling and laughing。

But then at the end of the night，They are like，Haha，No thank you，But you are cool。

You are really funny，You know，You might have to talk to 10 girls，But if I have to talk。

Like I believe Derek said this，If I have to talk to 20 girls in the night。

To find a girl that I have that chemistry with，I can do that，It's not a big problem。

You know I can talk to 20 fucking people，To find that girl。

And I'm not going to take the rejections personally，Because again。

I know I'm just putting myself out there，And I'm not seeing，Rejection anymore。

I'm seeing lack of chemistry，Ofcourse，This is provided，Your game mechanics are on point。

You are not making dumb fucking errors，Body language shit，You know how to move an interaction for。

You know the waypoints of the interaction，And in other words again，The nuts and bolts of mechanics。

As long as you are doing all that shit right，If you are being authentic。

Again it's not rejection anymore，It's just a lack of chemistry。

And so you don't get all but heard about it，You don't go into the downward spiral about it。

You just kind of turn to your friend，You hear what that's the plus and center of that shake。

It's ridiculous，Alright what's next man，Let's go，Boom，And you go on to the next。

And your neck goes up，Yeah，Yeah you'll never also like reach like full like confidence when it's routines。

Because you're always dependent on the thing you're saying，Like you won't be able to shut up。

Because you feel like，Oh if I'm not saying the line，She's not gonna like me。

Like you have no proof for her，It's cheesy as it sounds，Liking you for you，There's always。

Oh but I was saying that，You know I was using that line，I was acting like Jeff。

I was acting like Julian，That's why she liked me，I recently got back into online。

After the release of ETP2，Execute program 2。0，Which，I'm intended to be incredibly comprehensive。

Like literally every single thing that I know about online dating，Online，Appdating。

Is poured into that shit，It's the program itself is 24 fucking hours，I believe it's，Excuse me。

It's like 16 hours of，Like seminar about it，With examples，And breakdown。

And then there's eight hours of like infields on dates，But，Anyway execute the program。

But anyway with that，It's like，A big part of，The whole system of online is screening。

There's four main things，There's working volume，Okay，And this applies not just in on online。

But the thing is with online，Everydingleberry，Sitting on his ass，We covered in Cheeto dust。

Is on that shit，Because there's no，Realworld，Realtime，Like rejection，Style consequences to it。

You know，Like they can just send out these messages，And。

 even then guys do get very butthurt on that shit，When girls don't respond the way they'd like，But。

You got to work volume to cut through the fucking noise。

Like there's a terrible signal to noise ratio for the girls，So you have to work volume。

And this is what we say，Like get more girls，Like what if I can't get girls。

It just means approach fucking more，Like you got to approach a lot。

 Especially at the beginning when your skills aren't necessarily there。

To start to see the patterns emerge，To，You know，Get those，Good behaviors and grain。

To learn the social intelligence etc etc，But especially online。

Just the medium requires you to work volume，So furthermore that requires that you have some kind of system in place。

Because you can't be crafting，You need messages for every single girl，You have like a skeleton。

 a funnel，A sales funnel if you will，And that's the skeleton。

But you also have to be able to flesh that out，Because you can't just like need this robot spitting lines on the fucking internet either。

That's a thing，That's a lot，That's a big problem，Prob that a lot of guys encounter。

When trying to use that，To execute the program system for the first time，But I'm running the lines。

I'm just running the lines，It's like the girl doesn't feel any connection。

So you've got to at least flesh it out a little bit，Like a little tiny bit。

So that's where bringing your own personality comes into it，You know。

And the big thing is you've got to be different，You just got to stand out in some way。

And this is why like，You know，Could I open girls in the club by touching them on the arm and saying。

You're pay，My name is Jeff，You're gorgeous，Could I say that？，Sure。

I could probably even make that work，But I could probably also，Spray myself with fart spray。

And make that work，Why would I want to，Do you know what I mean，It's like your handicap in yourself。

I'm not putting some kind of personality in it，Because the thing is，Does that shit suck。

Does touching on the arm suck，Does saying hey what's up，I'm Jeff，Hey you're gorgeous，Does that suck。

I mean it's not fucking terrible，But the thing is every，95% of dudes are doing that。

That's how I identify，If I have a person that guy is open in the club，And so by doing that。

You are automatically，Slotting yourself into that regular guy category。

99% of who is the fucking brush off，The autopilot response，Sorry。

I'm not saying you have to be this like，You know， fucking lunatic， like entertainer，You know。

Hey kids，Pusting the fucking clown，No，But you gotta put some，Some money，You know。

 put a little spice on it， Motherfucker，You know what I mean，And that's both online，And IRL，Yeah。

Yeah，It's like giving her that sample，For to see who you are，Experience who you are too。

I'm not saying，We are going to text them，To see who you are，Experience who you are。

To see who you are，Experience who you are too，For who is like，Hey， What's up， window，心肯定不辦瀑布 在日本。

等我直接去，我在家里，我一直和某些 小弟们，去齐语，也不再知道，然后声音，会看到 knife，是，她。。"红翠娜，你干吗？"，hnely，嘿啊  pretty good，yeah。

What's your name dude，Where do you live，I know it's not even just，You're job，We the fuck are you。

Get the fuck away from me，I don't want to think about this shit，Yeah and it's not even casual either。

It's not like so how's it going，It's like there's so much like，Expectancy。

It's like their identity's like，So what do you do，Like did it，Yeah like very intense and shit。

So what we do is we go up，And we front load the attraction，We're like，Baba。

We I will go in pretty fucking hard，Right off the bat，I'm like，I'm not there's not a lot of。

Cit chat I'm like I'll go in，I'm like damn who are you，I'm Wendy。

Damn your name should be fucking love，Anyway，Damn you're making me feel weird。

And I'll start like ramped，I'm like your appearance is wonderful，I'll start ramping up like。

It's very clear what I'm there to do，I'm there to have a romantic encounter，Okay。

And I'm going to start layering that shit in，I'm going to start layering physicality。

And then once I get to the point，Whereshe's like accepting of this。

She's like okay I'm down with the possibility of hooking up with this guy。

Now I'm going to downshift and go to that get to know you crap。

Because now she has some kind of investment，She has some kind of reason to want to answer my questions now。

Because now she's interested in me romantically，She's still you know，So I want to see。

So I got to spend the requisite time，You know like about 45 minutes hour and a half。

And that's just to see if the guy really is normal。

Because weirdo can't keep up the fucking normal mask for that long，You know over，Over an hour period。

Even if she likes the guy，Over an hour period，And weirdo is going to fuck up。

He's going to say something fucked up，He's going to do something fucked up。

He's going to look reveal his butt hurt，Neediness or something like this。

And she'll be like oh thank god I didn't go with him，Take god I spent the time。

But you know in an hour passes，He's still pretty normal，Rules with the punches if the friends come。

You know when he gets difficult for him，And then he like you know smoothly orchestrates the pole。

She's going to go with him，She's like alright this is good，Let's do it，I feel safe with this guy。

Let's go，Yeah，Yeah，Yeah， Dude I keep thinking like those questions like。

It's literally like a fucking like if you're stuck in the uber。

And there's like that uber driver just keeps wanting to talk，It's like so how's your day。

And you're like oh good，And I'll sometimes like I'll do the headphones like。

And he's like so what about this，Yeah，He's like you know they did construction on this street。

About two years ago，And they put all this stuff in and you should see，I'm like fuck you shut up。

And I'm like and I'm like oh yeah，Oh really，You know trying to like be polite。

That's like literally the girls reactions，Like most approaches like so what's your name，Oh yeah。

Windy like oh yeah it's nice，And then that's like，Yeah that's a great analogy man。

Yeah if you're asking those questions，Imagine that time you were in the uber with the chatty driver。

And you just wanted to shut the fuck up，And how you acted，Look for that reaction to the girl。

See if she's acting like that like being polite，Yeah，And not partaking either。

Like well why isn't she contributing，That's why she's purposely not contributing to try to get out of it。

To try to hint，I don't want to talk，Yeah many guys lack the ability to see that，Yeah。

Or they'll come in and they're like be telling some story，You know they'll be like oh，Fuckin story。

Dudududududuah，And you're like，Just full ignore，Full ignore，And there's like keep going。

Cause they can't read those cues，You know like oh，Even me if I'm telling some story。

And the people are interested，But I see them kind of like。

Looking around or trying to like not paying attention，I have the ability to。

Okay let's just cut like maybe there was like 30 more seconds of story。

Let's just like cut everything we can，And finish it in seven seconds。

You know you have to have that ability，To see when people are glazing over like that。

And make a course correction，Maybe even call it out，I can't fuck，I'm kind of，Yeah。

It's a state of saints kind of boring isn't it？，Anyway I'm sorry。

I changed the subject and a lot of times if they see oh this guy at least had the fucking wherewithall。

You know he has the，SocialeQity to see emotional acuity to see that I'm fucking bored and change it。

That will actually hook him in，Oh yeah，A lot of the time and change it around。

Yeah cuz that's who it's like yeah no one has that social intelligence。

Like just having that your values like，And uh and linking it to routines too。

It's like that's something that even like focusing on，Like the lines and routines。

It's like you're so focused on that， That you forget or you don't even have like。

Was like the mental ramps even like zone in on what the girls feeling。

It's like they're so like I'm saying this I'm saying this I'm doing this。

And the girls like trying to get out of it but they just can't see that either，Yeah。

Yeah they're not present or like stuck in their head，Or conceptualizing is another one too。

They're just thinking like，The ones actually that come out now are pretty weird，It's like。

It's like am I offering value，Am I need you，I'm not offering value 100% of the time。

Like that's the shit that goes on through guys heads，So I'm like，Stop thinking that，Yeah。

What do you think guys should be thinking when they're in set，Uh I was joke。

They should have like the song，Fun fun fun fun sex sex，Fun fun fun sex sex on repeat。

I'm focused on what is this girl giving me emotionally right now。

And what are the changing dynamics if any like who's around what's the peer group。

What are the logistical obstacles I might have to like circumnavigate。

And where am I in the interaction and where does it need to go。

Right that's what I'm consciously thinking，The rest is just like again，Yeah。

Fun fun fun fun fun fun sex sex sex，It's boobs fun。

And that's the thing like guys don't bring the fucking fun man。

They go in there they're like so what are you doing like look again。

Because professional communication is concise，You know what I mean。

If I go up to like if you go to your boss and they're like，Hello Johnson，Like。

What are the numbers of the gss report today，I want those gss scores and you're like well boss。

I'm Chinese I love balls，Buzz，Buzz，Buzz，If you start doing that you're getting what is your boss like they say。

You're fucking fired，You know，However in a club，I'm Chinese and I love balls，Works amazing。

And I picked a girl up in Amsterdam like I'm fucking，Glorious like looking girl，Like by my saying。

Hi I'm Chinese I love balls，And then chanting the word balls as I slam the table over and over。

That's like my opener，Like if I go up to a girl in a club，And I say good evening。

You know my name is Jeffrey，And I had a rough childhood，I in a rough you know early 20s，However。

I met some friends and we stumbled into a weird kind of niche industry。

And we created it and we were the first movers，And we were able to build this brand and this industry into a。

MultiMillion Dollar International Business，And over many years I worked and I created a brand。

And now I'm relatively well off，And I'd like to you know I've traveled and I've had a lot of great experiences。

And I'd love to share these experiences with you，And maybe we could become you know get to know each other and get involved in a relationship。

And you know watch our children grow and achieve their dreams。

And and I would that might maybe that interest you。

Now what's more likely to work that or I'm Chinese，I love balls。

 Like obviously I love balls because it's low investment，Yeah。

 I have balls because it's like my way you do you want to hear my latest like。

 One of my latest statements at intent I just made this shit up， Like last weekend， I go I go。

 I'm like damn girl， I'm like you don't want to know what I'm thinking about doing。

 You don't want even want to know what I'm thinking about doing to you right now， And they're like。

 Oh I know what guys think， I'm like no you don't want to fucking know。

 She's like just say it just say it， Like I want to get to know you over a period of several months。

 Grow closer and closer as friends， And then perhaps consummate a romantic encounter。

 And meet all of your peer group and possibly your family maybe a trip for Christmas to your family。

 And then build a life together， And have children and watch them grow up。

 And achieve their dreams and be proud of them， And then live our twilight years together and die hand in hand。

 That's what I want to fuck you to you right now， You know like you're gonna say some gross sexual thing and then you say that。

 That's fucking， I like you， Yeah actually the one I'm doing now is。

 I find this fucking hilarious is like， I'll go in and， I was joke about my age。

 I'm like you know yeah just turned you know whatever say it's like 21 here in America。

 And then I'm like yeah you know first I'm in a club， It's still like it's so。

 But then I build then I'm like， It's I still like so gross here it's like everyone just is here for sex。

 I hate sex like dead serious， And she's like oh， And you'll see like most girls back。

 Yeah yeah sex you know， And I'm like yeah you know it's like I was hated it like honestly。

 And I know this is forward but， I was like too scared to masturbate until I was 17。

 And then like I stacked this in like， You'll see the girls just get sucked in I was too scared to and then I'm like。

 So you know how you know when guys like we're in the shower in school。

 And everyone just masturbates together， I would just like never join and she's like wait a minute like。

 Is that a thing？， And then I just stack like thing upon thing upon thing， So it's like yeah。

 That's my game now， You know I would never join in the masturbation circle in the shower in high school。

 It's like I would just never join us too scared， I would just like try a couple strokes。

 But then the other guys were just going way harder than me， And I just felt himself cautious。

 And I was like what the fuck， And like full of dead serious， Yeah it's， Oh shit， Yeah it's dope。

 Yeah that's my game now， But even that it's like you could open like。

 Yeah it's just kind of like into a part you could open with that like hey。

 So you know when you're 17 in the gym when everyone just masturbates。

 You know just always the little runt on the side， You just can't do it。

 And I would like dread the shit， She's like what the fuck like that would work better than you know like hey what's up。

 Hey what's up， You're beautiful， Yeah， You're beautiful， You're beautiful how's it going？。

 Yeah because it's also like bringing us into your world。

 I think that's like the most powerful thing， It's like the best way to even open is like check this out。

 Like join into what I'm into who I am， Yeah it's like some fucking line like the frames different like you're seeing it together。

 It's not even yours， it's not even your world， And yeah it just won't work。

 The other thing I was going to ask you to， And you talk a lot about this。

 And you have like a lot of footage about this is three cents， You have any advice on that。

 Oh man three cents is， It's one of those things that。

 It's probably the best thing I've ever done with my life， Aside from getting ripped abs。

 Maybe equal， Literally probably the biggest philanthropic contribution to the world。

 Was having three cents， You know I was joke like a lot of people will say oh three cents it's cool。

 But you know they're not that great， These people are incorrect， It's fucking awesome。

 And it's like I would say it's like， Driving two sports cars at once， If you could somehow do that。

 No it's fucking dope， But again the key with that。

 Is maintaining this sort of like dream like ethereal presence。

 So you know there's this one video in the hot seat where I pull。

 I'm with my girlfriend and we pulled this girl from the nightclub we pulled her into the van。

 And she's like oh I have a， My boyfriend this and that some bullshit。

 And the boyfriend even calls while we're doing it in the van and she answers the phone。

 She's like oh hi honey， Oh I'm I'm just gonna be home soon， Oh yes I'm having a great night。

 I'll be home soon I love you I love you baby， I love you bye。

 She's like my boyfriend's and she hangs up， She's like my boyfriend's the sweetest thing。

 And it's so weird because she obviously loves the boyfriend， Right she loves him。

 But why would she fuck me and my girlfriend in this van， Well number one。

 It's so outside of the realm of like normalcy that， She it doesn't count。

 Right at some point she's like oh do you have any liquor in here。

 I want to have a shot or something I'm like oh no I have booze at my house。

 It's a couple blocks away we can just drive over there and I can mix up cocktail。

 She's like no she says no it has to be now， Right because going to some house that's cheating。

 Right fucking in this weird crazy van with all these lights and shit， That's just a dream。

 You know what I mean it's just a fucking dream， And I think like the key and this isn't just with with three cents。

 But also in pick up in general it's like you said， Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun。

 You do not want to bring in like your LinkedIn， Or Instagram or Snapchat or any of that fucking shit。

 Like as now if you do that shit Facebook， Now you are part of her social circle。

 There are consequences to social circle， There are no consequences to fucking in like this dream van。

 With a Donald Trump peeing out in it and shit， Like it's like a fantasy it's not real。

 You know what I mean this is the same reason why girls will fuck on the first date。

 From the internet they'll fuck me off the first date， Because I nothing about me is real。

 In fact I even had girls， Say to tell me later that they said that they fucked me。

 Because they wanted to see what I was what I act like when I'm not trying to get laid。

 Like they would they wanted to see how I act after。

 Right and it is true I turn like I become more of like a real person then。

 You know what I mean like oh actually yes I hear less you know we can have dinner and shit like that。

 You know if I want to continue that with them you know that type of relationship with them。

 But yeah I mean it's just keep it fucking fun you know like that's the key with three cents keep it fun。

 And as far as how to get like a three way make out。

 And this is like a quick practical advice that I can give that anyone can use like whether you're going out with your girlfriend。

 Whether you're going out solo and you have two girls you know in the set with you。

 How to get a three way make out a lot of people think oh this is impressive。

 It's not impressive in the slightest in fact because all you do is you do this you go you go you take the heads you go happy family。

 And then you bring together that's it that's all you do you say the words happy family。

 That's it how do you family boom and bring their fucking heads together and then they will do it nine times out of ten。

 So there you go the happy family technique it reveals I do that。

 I'd say the last thing this is usually I conclude these videos if you could share like one thing I heard about in a lot in ten game is。

 Games really about like these epic stories experiences you have if you have one you could share like if you look back like you know one story。

 Or experience that kind of stands out or you're like fuck you out like that's what the game is about。

 Oh geez if you read my book you you might remember there's this kind of like。

 climactic event in the first like third like right before the halfway point where I've been doing game for several years and I got pretty good at it。

 And I had a situation where I wanted to fuck this girl but she someone knocked on me and told all of this guy studies pick up。

 And she's like she's like this guy fucking she's like she emailed me she's like I heard that you do this pick up shit。

 This is disgusting it's fucking retarded this would never work on me or anyone I know please stop contacting me。

 I was like fuck you ho I was like wouldn't work on you or anyone you know huh。

 So I decided to systematically sleep with all of her friends her female friends just to spite her and so I made a。

 Fuck list like from kill Bill you know she had a death list and a fuck list of five girls I started with the fatty and worked my way up。

 So I had I got to the last one and she had heard about through the grapevine about me doing all these other girls。

 She's like she started talking me one night out at the bar she's like I heard about you dead and out of all this shit。

 She's like the fat girl must have been a interesting experience I was like yeah anyway so we started like talking back and forth。

 And I finally got her to meet me out at the club one night and so she met me out and we started making out etc and then her friend comes over。

 And she's like oh isn't that them dudes we was talking to before and she looks up and she's like oh and runs over there it's like these dudes there。

 And she starts talking to this guy and he's like a tall good looking guy and again if you you hear that phrase you probably have。

 Like a vision your head of what the guy looked like that's what he looked like right and so I'm like all fucked up more high too。

 I'm like what do I do what I do my friend Kristoff comes over he's like man you this cheek she says you she going to fuck you tonight you got to。

 Foxy's cheek tonight in French if you were wondering what that was and then he's like you got a Foxy's cheek she says I'm going to fuck Jeffy tonight I'm like yeah but she's with this guy now。

 And he looks over he's like hey mad Foxy's guy go get her I'm like I'm like okay okay so I go over。

 And I have this huge tug of war and you know I get her attention back he pulls her down and we're I do I make some。

 Commotion over here so she gets up and sees like back and forth back and forth back and forth it ends I'm with her out front the venue the guy comes out drags。

 Or off and she's like we're going to the phone booth come with this other bar and Kristoff's like all right man let's go and I'm like dude fuck this shit it it's over you know I'm not going to follow。

 This her around with her little fucking dude like her little puppy dog fuck this shit is like oh okay man see you next time get。

 Sound is like a little best button like fucks off。

 And so I start walking home and as I'm walking home I'm fucking crying like like waters coming out of my fucking face。

 Why well I was like dude， I thought I had like this connection with this girl， you know。

 We talk on the phone all the fucking times she came here to meet me we're making out and now this guy comes and she just fucking leaves。

 Like how could this bitch fucking do this？ You know what I mean？ How could she fucking do this？。

 And it kind of said me like the good looking guy comes and the game doesn't matter。

 you know all this crap you've been learning， It didn't mean jack shit like with in the face of the good looking tall guy and so I'm saying they're crying at like in this residential street。

 And I think to myself all of a sudden I'm like what would Tyler do？。

 Right like wwtd and like literally I see him there in the street in my mind's eye like like a spectral vision like a blue ghostly。

 Apparition like Obi-Wan fucking Kenobi and he looks at me like man。

 He's like man like you know what you got to do， You got to march to that bar low that motherfucker eat。

 Pull the girl back and fuck her， Right and I'm like yeah， cuz that's what he would do。

 You know what I mean？ That's what he would do because the number one thing that I I respect about Owens game is that。

 He's always at the cause not the effect like he's never there's never things happening to him。

 It's always like， Him doing things to other people like him making things happen in the environment and that's like what the hot seat's all about。

 His hot seat my hot seat like it's about because it's not just about girls。

 It's about becoming the cause not the effect in your life not just with girls。

 Been your business and your goals and your fitness in your life not just at the effect end of shit being knocked around under the water。

 You're up you're surfing the way of life。 So I， Was like yeah。

 and I got up and I marched back and to that bar and the chicks like oh my god。

 You came and I had another big tug of war with the guy back and forth like literally the chicks running back and forth across the。

 Cross the bar to me and this guy me and this guy finally at the end of the night。

 I forget exactly what happened there was some little skirmish outside with him and then she announced I'm going home with。

 Jeffy and I put her home and I beg her， but here's the most important part， I。

 Thought that that guy was cooler than me， You know what I mean？。

 But what I realized afterwards was that the only reason he was cooler than me was because I thought he was like I gave him that power。

 Right， so what it comes down to is again being at the cause not the effect winners。

 Quarant quote will always do the most productive thing in a given situation。

 They will look at the situation will make what is the most productive thing I could do here and they'll do that losers almost never do。

 Right losers almost never do so again， The big takeaway for me and like again with game is just one avenue to be on your path。
