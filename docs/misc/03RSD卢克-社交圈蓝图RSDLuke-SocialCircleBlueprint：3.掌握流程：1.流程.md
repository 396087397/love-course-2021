Legistics will always trump game， always，If your goal is just go out there and get laid。

 first of all，Legistics will always trump game，This is a concept that will get you laid。

 more than any wingman pick up coach，female wing girl， any job promotion。

 any six pack will ever get you laid， This concept of logistics trumping game。

 will always give you better results， and what this does it tells you that。

 it reinforces in your mind that， game can only get you so much， game is a， a dial。

 game is this spiral of emotions， game is this roller coaster emotions。

 now granted the better at game you get， the more persuasive ability you get。

 the more influence you have， the better success you can have with your game。

 but logistics will always trump it， an example of that is the， the doesn't need a driver。

 see you meet a girl and she loves you， is while they track it maybe you。

 made out with her when you guys walked， to the bathroom， she just broke up with her boyfriend。

 a month ago which is just kind of， enough time for to get over it。

 but enough time for her girlfriend， to get back out there， she's your exact type， she likes you。

 i don't know why， she just happens to think you're amazing。

 and her friends are getting massive shots， at the bar， she is the designated driver， a lot of guys。

 will amp it up，因為他們會說，Oh， the girl likes me，My jokes are working，So how do I pull this girl。

 Cuz she's giving me some resistance on the pull， She's giving resistance on。

you getting her back to your place， So what do you do？， A lot of guys will just tell more jokes。

 That are working really well， Nickname that worked in the past， They're gonna use it a lot further。

 The thing you have to understand is， Logistics will always trump it。

 Logistics of the situation are that， She cares and has a lot of trust for her friends， Usually。

 So she is going to be a designated driver， And take her friend's home，那么一个阔水不会很抚，但好一些传去。

这两件事 pirates，曾经有一展，各个双方认识，这两个是这男椠，有关任何传埠，这两个男椠，那一点，也是就是輒 top死的，和咻再再一块，这个细节，为大家指審，让你的外 journey，也就是。

这两个人，就去下密方式，如果你之前，感觉好像セット，c我在普手，加油，有個公司100%加起來，或者是一個Ult initiation，而貴ests的能夠，以貴 Stock on 100%，我告訴你。

Lsonon，想不知能不能，例如有個Lonice，天政，我是個Lonice，自帶牌，連RU工作， meaning I want to create some sort of big bang that happens in the group。

 where everybody thinks that I'm this crazy social guy。

 because it happens when you're a crazy social guy， you're safe， you're trustworthy。

 you're preselected， all these traits， you're confident。

 all these traits that you're actively trying to embody just happen。

 so when I'm trying to hold the whole group together。

 suddenly every girl thinks I'm this safe trustworthy， amazing guy， they don't know they know。

 so instead what happens is half of them don't ever want to come with anyway。

 and it'll kind of break off but you'll probably stuck with a few of them。

 what I like to do if it's a alcohol situation is I like to I'm the Uber master。

 I am the Uber master I will I will have the Uber waiting for them， because here's the thing。

 number one is like if you're a guy who's improving his dating life or。

 you're increasing your social networking life， you should have unlimited。

 Ubers almost unlimited Ubers like I have more Uber credit than I could possibly use。

 and I use Uber as probably my main vehicle most of the time。

 but I mean I'll install Uber on girls' phones who don't have it to get the $20 credit。

 because it's pretty funny it's like an easy way to add value to it。

 it's crazy how many people don't know that， that you you know you give lift or Uber to somebody else you each get some free credit。

 it's crazy how many people don't know that in the in the interaction。

 so you'll give them a free Uber credit you'll get them an Uber。

 because I mean the reason I even mentioned that is a lot of guys will say。

 oh but you're paying for their Uber's I don't want to pay for the other some other， chicks Uber。

 funny thing is the most cities the Uber bill is six to twelve dollars， like it's super cheap right。

 but you get them in the Uber what why is it important to use Uber， instead of another method。

 why is Uber very helpful in this moment， Uber is very important because， uh。。。 cabs。

 cabs are like as shady as Uber's are cabs are way shadier， you put a little Uber。

 all the info comes out it's it's very difficult， to have it for an Uber driver to be super inappropriate。

 it happens but， it's uh。。。 the drivers info is there you can see the path that they go on， uh。。。

 you can share the， there's so many things with an Uber now that make it a very safe logistical。

 helper， you can even do Uber XL now where it's uh。。。 cheaper than， the SUV， but it's uh。。。

 you can still carry the whole group， you know the one of the you know the Uber SUV those was easy ways to。

 truly appear like somebody who's very very high value of having to actually。

 display it well maintained logistics， logistics that's something that you can spend a some a decent amount of。

 money on that actually helps you rather than value spending money on values， like this， empty。

 bucket you can just keep， there's always somebody with a nicer car。

 right one of my best friends here he drives a drowsy lamborghini hurricane。

 which is like a two hundred three thousand or a car， i think epic i don't super cool。

 but someone pulled up in his one of his neighbors just bought two of， interdoors。

 those start like six hundred or something five they're very very expensive cars。

 so what do you do this is is these are， high-status social circles i only。

 kind of a dabble in an ad value in terms of women and networking but， uh。。。

 he the next day he had to buy a ferrari because he couldn't handle。

 being the guy with the baby lamb， right well it's value values this pit it values kind of like looks there's always。

 somebody better looking， there's always somebody with more money there's no way to do that right。

 logistics， you can just be ingenious you can just be clever gregarious， poignant。

 and solve logistics， and close girls that normally you never be able to close because of。

 logistics not match you know， you understand i'm gonna keep going to get a select four or five times。

 points about this， every main module that i go through with you guys， you can use to。

 close girls hook up with girls date girls， just off that one module alone if you become an expert in。

 taught a lot of guys just become expert in logistics， and they didn't。

 build their army they did the the you army they didn't uh。。。。

 work on the inner game at all they do the parties they did anything else。

 they just did this one thing alone， but they they got really good at it， uh。。。

 step one is to realize this， not step one， the asterisk the the mission statement the core。

 the core part of logistics trumping game， is the concept that if the girls back at your place。

 at three and more the chances something sexual is going to happen， extremely high， extremely high。

 platonic or not platonic the chances are very high。

 but so many guys are worried about their openaries so many guys are worried， about。

 how they're gonna spark attraction this one case over here or， this other situation over here。

 who gives a shit， think about what what what your uh。。。 it's like poker， when um。。。。

 you know that the the the shows the hands， not the hands the river the flop， i don't play poker， uh。

。。 i don't play poker but that when the dealer does something with the。

 cards and they see in the little tv， all the different percentages that uh。。。 that change。

 that's kind of like， getting a girl back at your place at three and you get her back at your place。

 at three and， even she fucking hates you for some reason， which would be odd but it happens。

 right consentually back at your place at three and。

 something was what the chances of something's happened， very very high， so knowing that。

 all of a sudden you start realizing escalation is not your problem， escalation。

 will stop her from getting back to your place at three and， escalation will make。

 the chances of you in her hooking up once she's back at your place， more likely。

 because what's gonna happen a lot of girls who are up for that escalation。

 they're not gonna allow themselves to go back to your place。

 they do you less safe they need less trustworthy， they don't like the grouping they don't like that escalation。

 but think about it once you're back at the place if the odds rise。

 regardless of the escalation you've already done， as long as she's back at your place at three and。

 that's something sexual is going to happen， then when she want to just cast a bigger filter to have a better chance of。

 getting the girls you talk to back at your place， at three four and。

 rather than having to screen them out earlier on， you follow， so the answer is yes。

 get the girl back to your place through commonalities。

 through any hook any plausible liability anything just get them back， for whatever reason。

 talk about a lot of reasons， later about how you can get them back and how you can see the poll and just。

 fight the clothes and all this stuff right， but if you can just use logistics alone， to segue it。

 you're gonna beat out any guy that's gaming to the point where， logistics beats out， uh。。。

 logistics will be out， friends that know have known the girl for a long time。

 logistics will be that you and your attraction building， will be that everything。

 logistics at first starts with， the four logistical questions， four logistical questions。

 who are you here with， what are you doing after this。

 where you stay in and what are you doing tomorrow。

 these four questions are not meant to be read off like a checklist。

 these four questions are meant to， get the answers from the girl。

 and then drill down deep into each answer， if you don't know what to say when you're talking to girls you're not pulling。

 consistently， or closing consistently for that matter。

 then just make your entire interaction about these four questions。

 and even if the girl tries to steer you off of these questions。

 just dive in deeper and deeper and deeper into each one。

 for example when you ask so where you hear with and she says， i'm with my college sorority girls。

 it's a once a year trip， she's anything right， then what you do is。

 you always reward the thing the girl says， holy shit that's really cool it's great that you guys were able to maintain。

 this， consistency each year， able to stay close a lot of people are able to do that。

 a lot of girls just kind of after college is ditched their friends。

 so that's a big reward it's two three four sentences about how cool it is， that they're able to。

 you know how cool is that you think that they all came together， a lot of guys will tease that。

 and then they'll try to tear apart the group， the better persuasive tactic is to build the group up。

 and then watch them go against it， if you're the one who's trying to drive the wedge between the girls that you're。

 talking to， it's very very apparent obvious， was audio， it's very obvious。

 what's less obvious and a little more interesting and sneaky is for you to， actually。

 build the groups up and then watch them come up with watch them give you， reasons on why。

 they should hang out with you instead of them， so you do the you know one two three four sentences i'll even go even further。

 with my rewards， i want to be as elaborate with them as possible and then i'll ask a deeper。

 question about the thing that she said， so an example of a deeper question would be。

 switch one of your sorority girls is your， was your best friend back then。

 it's pretty deep question right， another example would be which uh。。。

 when you're sorority girls have you， kept in contact with the most。

 which one i mean there's an infinite level of questions here that you can ask， right。

 so you ask the question because you gave a very positive frame and rewarded。

 the previous thing that she said， she's much more likely to give you a big answer。

 to the next question， but again this isn't game， this is really just。

 asking the real questions and making her feel good about asking these questions。

 if you can tie the second part onto the logistics which is， if you can make。

 the woman feel better about herself when she's around you where do you think she's， going to be。

 around you， so if you can make her feel consistently good about this is where it gets a little bit sneaky。

 if you can make her feel really really good about herself will she's around you。

 well you're for getting the situation escalating into a place where something sexual。

 intimate can happen， where do the chances， of her actually going to that place， well she。

 feels good what she's around you higher lower， dramatically higher。

 rather than just trying to like force it into you know into plausible liability or。

 some weird justification and why she's back your place。

 you justify it because a lot of us just say I'll see the close， or， give plausible liability。

 no it's about all it's a it's a very multifaceted situation if you want to have。

 the magical thing in game called consistency， if you want to have consistency。

 you want to look at all these factors， so one of those factors be just fine the clothes with some sort of。

 plausible liability again that's not game， having some reason on why she's back your place。

 I know a guy who does the whole glass blowing thing is a mature。

 hand blown glass back is place girls love it， they eat it up， I am the after party guy right。

 I'm the guy always knows where the best after party is and then I have an。

 after after party in my place which is， more chill。

 I mean I'm the party guy there's the there's different things you can do here。

 to have plausible liability other just go to the after party or they're just。

 going to this other thing， you know my friends were in that hotel room。

 you know you're going to some， I mean girls all the time who they they wind up in some random guys hotel。

 room because their friends were， we're going to that hotel room。

 well that's the plausible not abilities that friends were going to go。

 that hotel room even if the friends weren't in that hotel room at all anyway。

 any kind of plausible not ability that you can you can establish， it's better， got it。

 then on top of that if you can get her invested in the logistics。

 is a step two get her invested in the logistics， again most guys will just screen for logistics or they'll read off like。

 a checklist to look at logistics as a， a step in their game not as an overarching structure。

 if you look at logistics as an overarching structure。

 you're going to get a lot more buying a participation from her and solving， those logistics。

 if you can get her buying in and participating， in the logistical questions that you're establishing。

 what ends up happening is you get her convincing herself and you the logistics， are not a problem。

 based on the structure of these conversations and questions， in the linear path。

 for example when you ask the girl， who you're here with and then she tells you her。

 co-workers to switch from the sorority girl example。

 girl says I'm here my co-workers we just left a work conference， a simple reward to that would be。

 holy shit that's awesome， so to get buying from her， you do a strong leading reward。

 a leading reward is an example of that is what I just said， holy shit that's awesome。

 when I say holy shit that's awesome， what do you think she says， anything she says what she says。

 yeah thank you， you know thank you or what is usually the common response to that。

 and either way I don't really care I just want that skin in the game I want。

 that buying that participation， again most guys will just say， most guys won't even do this at all。

 the logistical game at all but， once you learn about logistics most guys are just saying oh who are you with。

 and the girl says oh， here with my co-workers and they'll just say okay。

 where they at and then they'll try to do what isolate， how do I get her away from the co-workers。

 right， no no you want to have the opposite mentality， you want to keep the thing together。

 because you don't actually have to hold it together all the way to your place。

 you just have to show in fact the more you shove it on their throats that。

 you're this social friendly guy I'll even say I'm a social friendly guy it's okay。

 we can say how much of a social friendly guy you are the more you can portray that。

 the less likely they are to actually stick around， and I'm going to show you some ways that you can。

 keep it going even if they do stick around but trying to isolate is very apparent。

 so when you reward you say holy shit that's awesome that's great， the girl says oh thank you。

 and then what you do is no really it's， it's fantastic how you can actually have a good working relationship。

 but then also maintain a relationship where you guys can go out and be social。

 and let it hang there as well， another leading reward， when I say no really。

 that's almost implied the no really almost implies that she's。

 disagreeing with me at first or she's saying something that。

 isn't in alignment with what I'm saying it doesn't matter。

 I'm trying to package up what she's saying and run with it， so no really it's actually amazing。

 this is about to be a positive frame， when you lay out this positive frame。

 they respond in a very positive way to you at least for the next couple。

 sentences which is all that you need to keep drilling deeper。

 no amount of impact and emphasis I'm putting on these logistics and getting that。

 buy-in from the girl， it doesn't matter how much you win her over what matters how much。

 skin in the game buy-in you can get from her in this type of conversation。

 that's really that's really awesome holy shit， oh thank you she's gonna say and then you say。

 that's just awesome you can maintain that work relationship and then， still see them at。

 you know a nightlife type setting， a bar whatever that's that's really cool。

 a lot of people just can handle that they get too competitive in the workplace。

 then hang out socially a lot of people need that social。

 let me get notice you're talking but you're not talking about yourself。

 she's you're encapsulating the conversation， in a very。

 us against them kind of frame you're encapsulating conversation in a。

 I understand and show empathy for where you're coming from。

 watch me now show how much I really understand the words that are coming out， of your mouth。

 because most people don't ever think that anybody is actually listening them， when they're speaking。

 but when you can show the girl that， not only are you listening but you're understanding and your empathizing。

 watch the trust and report is shoot through the roof。

 rather than another guy in the bar try to make a bunch of funny jokes。

 you can still break report throughout this entire interaction。

 but that's if you want to add the game on top of it you don't even need to。

 you can use the the assumptions questions， uh。。。 the， you can use the assumptions。

 to drive the interaction further， and watch what the game kind of naturally happen as you're doing this。

 so that you want to do positive， reward to each thing that she says to get the buy-in。

 and then give deeper questions to each one， this could last you forty five minutes to an hour， just。

 doing these questions， and you're gonna get massive buy-in from the girl。

 so again you should have twenty questions set up， by the time you get down with this the four-year school questions and four。

 follow-ups to each， that's four-original plus sixteen that's why it's twenty， once you've done this。

 it's a bit of a good litmus test to know that you've， gone through the basis。

 no once you've had one say this， once you've gone through all twenty。

 it's a good test to know that you've actually put a good effort into。

 solving the logistics and going for the poll， once you've done the twenty properly you're gonna notice that it just promotes。

 and prompts， a widespread conversation that you don't have to work for the conversation deeper。

 the teases will come naturally， yes girl where you stay， girl says Luxor， start laughing。

 let's say you ask where you stay and the girl says um。。。， Carrollton， or Plano。

 suburbs north of Dallas， ask her what time her uh。。。 her flight leaves， she can make it on time or。

 you know is uh。。。 she can have to， you know do the chores or will the cows be fine on her farm。

 implying that it's a， you know a rural area， again these。

 this doesn't have to be vagus la my amy you could do this in any any city right。

 whatever city you get me your eyes are all from different cities。

 any one of these cities you guys can tease about this right rural area uh。。。 make。

 fun of me and rural， guess what if she's from a city area an urban area。

 make fun of her for that too， it's irrelevant with the thing is just。

 polarized the girl and run with it， that's we can sprinkle a little bit of game to it。

 but we're gonna find is when you start going deeper deeper you should ask。

 things like all we do tomorrow， you're gonna notice the girl kind of flip back with you after you put so much。

 investment into the conversation， and she's gonna say things like， i'm not sure yet。

 what kind of the winter tomorrow， she's gonna ask the girl what you do after this and she give more open-ended。

 responses that you can， drive home， this is a very good way to do this on a。

 first time you meet a girl kind of basis， the best way to make。

 closing off logistics and realizing that， logistics always trump's game is on your day to close。

 if you're willing to， you know go on dates with girls。

 not many dates with individual girls but just what you want to do， you can do an amazing。

 layout an amazing linear progression in your date。

 that will give you that even if you want to go off of it， use my anecdotal。

 reference as a good experience， manager experience is good reference for you。

 the way that i set this up is this， i said my goal goal was how do i。

 close the girl how do i hook up with a girl， even if i'm just too exhausted from gaming。

 to exhaust from game in a teaching game or， i have a big work project how do i do this because i just because i。

 and you know don't want to game on a particular day。

 doesn't mean that i should lose a chance to hook up with a girl that's my， exact type of girl。

 so i was in texas when i came up with this which is， the sushi trampolines and chocolate date。

 have you guys ever heard my sushi trampolines and chocolate， you heard it。

 go i wanted to tell you to， and scostle， so i came up with the sushi trampolines and chocolate date。

 because i wanted to find a way to get the girl back to my place， hundred percent of the time。

 but with her begging to go back， whether she had work in the morning whether this was a girl who。

 it was a party girl or she was a professional whatever whatever the girl。

 it was relevant how did i get her to， my goal is how do i get her to agree to come back to my place。

 with pretty much a hundred percent consistency well the first step is。

 what if i could get her to agree even subliminally or or suddenly to go。

 back to my place before she even accepts the date， before she even shows up for the date。

 and then the rest were just fulfilling the steps as it progresses。

 what do you think that's going to do my confidence level or my state or my。

 self-esteem or my inner game it's going to go through the roof。

 what's it going to do to the social proof at each place along this date it's。

 going to go through the roof， it's going to be very easy to build the army so we're very easy， to。

 network it's going to be very easy to create this set up where。

 everybody's got phomo because they see how how much cool shit i'm doing。

 on a consistent basis with how cool this date is， i'm able to save a shit ton of money。

 right it's all the five cornerstones i'm able to save a shit ton of money。

 because just by going to this but becoming a regular。

 and by always bringing a date to these regular places， you're going to find that。

 every bill is oh here's fifty percent off and general manager comes over and。

 gives you a you know complimentary dessert or， um you know you walk into the the bar at the end uh you know in the middle of。

 this date and just give you the free drinks and， stuff that i never even asked for it's。

 it was very uncomfortable at first because i didn't know how to handle it and。

 i realized oh this is why i'm getting laid off this because。

 all the it's not about the the dollar profit lost savings。

 the whole point though is it's like it's cooler than if i was a guy who's。

 just blowing the money on each thing at each point in the date。

 because girls would tell me they're like oh i've been on dates with guys that。

 were spending a lot more money on me than you but。

 they would say a lot of things like who are you what what。

 they're oftentimes uh say things like what are you i was like what do you mean。

 what am i and they're like well how is this happening why is every place that。

 we go to they're just treating you like a king， oh i don't know i don't know right you just downplay the whole thing。

 so the way this date sets up is you meet a girl you get her phone number。

 first text is this right and you guys ever wonder what's the text girl what kind。

 of game message you can send to to kind of spark it i mean we all have right。

 so i said you know what's the what's the highest leverage text meaning the。

 text that i can send with the least amount of words get the best response。

 for my actual goal of dating this girl or sleeping with her。

 and i tested you know 50 to 100 messages and the best one i。

 came up with from the data not just randomly， is want to go on an adventure question mark。

 i actually also tested out the spaces it's better if you can put a space。

 between the last letter of your question and then the either the question mark。

 or the exclamation point or whatever i don't know why it works it just works。

 really well super simple um not even worth stopping for。

 if you can put a space between your last letter of your last word in the。

 sentence and then your punctuation you're always going to get a better。

 response especially the question， so the one that i tested was want to go on an adventure it's got a very very。

 high success rate of girls responding back， even girls that didn't really like me were responding back to this。

 they maybe didn't say yeah of course when can i do that but they were。

 responding back haha what kind of adventure， well that's awesome because all i want even if the girl wasn't super interested。

 first you have to look at game has been a segue to approach。

 meaning everything you do should just get you into the next step you if you。

 can do that game is a piece of cake you're success with women is a piece of。

 cake so want to go on an adventure she says， haha what kind of adventure or for sure definitely any sort of response。

 whatever the response is you send back， do you like well first you'd say all right sweet cool you know some sort of。

 statement like that and then you'd say do you like sushi trampolines and。

 chocolate question mark at this point she's just so。

 fucking confused that she wants to answer it because now you've turned this。

 very serious thing like a date into a game so you've created an amazing。

 setup which is you are the text buddy that she's， so engaged with texting between you and her that she is very excited to keep。

 it up it's not just a random text buddy， so when she's so once you say uh do you want to go on sushi do you like sushi。

 trampolines and chocolate the beauty here is you're wedging your full。

 clothes your actual pull in between two things that are innocuous that are。

 simple so sushi and chocolate very common date idea is very simple。

 it's almost from a buzzfeed article very very simple right well the trampolines。

 I had a huge uh what was big trampolines in her backyard we lived you know。

 15 20 minutes from the downtown area in the small town I lived at the time。

 and I determined hey how do I how do I get the girl to be in a place where。

 she's very comfortable with me well I told myself you know I lived in a。

 place where it was good weather I was I was thinking how do I get a girl back。

 to my place will drink that's you know let's creepy and boring movie I don't。

 know she's got to be really into it how do I get to go back to my place even。

 she's like curious about me or mildly interested well without me putting。

 any pressure on her well I got a big big-ass trampoline so what what is。

 everyone jump on with their kid right these big-ass trampolines a bit of。

 age regression any time that you can make the other person feel like they're。

 a kid again their emotions very vulnerable and valuable the more you can。

 make her feel like a kid again the more excited she is to be a part of what。

 you're doing well the trampoline kind of covers that front but I wedged it。

 in between and sandwich sandwich that in between two things that are very。

 obvious and simple right like the sushi and chocolate she's much more。

 likely to agree the whole thing rather than if I say oh do you like trampolines。

 she might be like wait what this is kind of weird but if I say do you like。

 sushi trampolines and chocolate almost that was almost a hundred percent。

 conversion rate of a message back ha ha I'm confused ha I love sushi or I。

 I love chocolate or I haven't been on trampoline a long time there's some sort。

 of response like that which is all that you want you want that buy-in you want。

 that participation so then you lock it down with logistics again without。

 gaming at this point a lot of guys would try to game over text to build more。

 attraction I just wanted to show up for the day too even my attraction。

 goes down a little bit but my percentage of her actually going to the day。

 to increases that's better than higher attraction and less。

 chance of it her showing up because I want consistency I don't want。

 random success so when she shows up right so the sushi place sushi is a good。

 date and again you're not going to do this date on every girl right it's just a。

 it's just a good anecdote it's a good reference example you can switch it up。

 with whatever you want just kind of take the the framework for it on why it。

 works so well so far there's been no game it's been very。

 fundamental it's been very simple so when she shows up we go to sushi place。

 that obviously I've already taken I've already taken a lot of girls on this。

 date too right I've done my group date here so I have a lot of social。

 proof every you know hostess then waitress everybody in this place I've。

 already know obviously you do this for the very first time it's not going。

 to work as well but you do five ten dates here， girl every girl it works there every guy that's there is going to look at。

 you like the man they're going to do the whole， oh you again all this guy this fucking guy。

 every every cocked waitress is it is going to come out from behind the thing。

 every bartender is going to come out give you the hug oh hey good to see。

 again even they don't really like you that much because you're regular。

 right it's pure mere exposure effects just showing up somewhere over and。

 over again builds deep level rapport you want the effective。

 wait how many girls have you brought it she's never going to be a。

 accusatory she's never going to look at you and be like oh yeah how many。

 girls you fucking brought here it's not it's not in a mean way she's。

 going to look at you and go oh yeah how many girls have you brought here。

 and she's going to smirk and it's going to be kind of funny。

 so if you go oh no you're the first one baby I love you。

 right it's not going to go very well which is you play it off you go。

 right there's a lot of ways you could say right you could actually say。

 that exactly I mean we have to say a little bit differently right like oh。

 you're the first one I just texted them ahead of time I。

 I told them to do that to make me look good anything doesn't make you look。

 good or make you look like a player or make you look a little bit off。

 just say I did that to make me look good and it will。

 it's a bit confusing it's a bit of a pattern up to the point where。

 they'll it ends up helping you more than hurting you。

 right what that doesn't so make me look good but if I say oh I did that to。

 make me look good right it's completely converts the negative。

 positive it's a really really cool little little move。

 but massive pre-selection bro even if those girls like our own have。

 only come here on giving you that hog and the handshake or whatever because。

 you've been there a few times it doesn't take a weeks or months to do。

 this takes a couple a couple times so they see you at your table。

 you just start asking her questions really boring questions even with。

 just a few questions just statements and questions。

 you know I had a certain point you're going to have if you've been there a few。

 times you're going to have the the general manager come over。

 you know make sure everything's okay right joke if you want to add a little bit。

 game piece with him a few times you know tell him how this fish you know this。

 fish on this sushi roll doesn't seem like it's cooked well enough。

 or you don't you think it's a little bit undercooked that's funny because。

 sushi's raw okay hi jokes back and forth with you。

 then you ask the girl at a certain point oh do you want to go grab that。

 chocolate now the girls are going to say oh sure okay fine I guess you know。

 that's the next thing because you're already preempted all。

 she already agreed to it whereas if you're on a date some of his。

 hard to get the girl to go on these bounce locations you know because。

 it looks like you're trying to do something whereas if she already agreed to。

 it all ahead of time makes it very easy on you， this is why I can give you very consistent almost guaranteed results。

 so then once you go to the chocolate place the chocolate place that I set up。

 was a place with this open air it was a， bunch of gay and trendy bars outside so as crazy people watching。

 it was like really really funny and then all the seats there were love seats。

 were we kind of like squished into the middle just a little。

 so you're not on you know stools or tables or whatever。

 and then at the venue which helps with you know， you know keynote and touch you don't have to actually escalate you just。

 naturally kind of close to her then what I ordered is this off the menu item。

 which is uh make your own smore so we you know it's not on the menu but I。

 know that you know it's chocolate but it's not just random chocolate it's。

 unique right we you never even have one of the， couple bites each like you don't even have to do that it's super simple the。

 point is to satisfy that that next stop， get that next thing in but think about how unique is how cool is it when。

 the thing isn't on the menu just just by you knowing that that's available。

 is really cool next is it's an activity anytime you can create a date。

 out of an activity that's what you want to do that but the problem is most。

 activity is our sports or it's a lot of investment on your half on your。

 behalf it's a lot of stuff that you have to do， whereas you roast your own smore super simple you hold the fucking stick here。

 and you roast it but again more age regression it's back when you guys were。

 kids roasting marshmallows at camp right it's it's it's crazy to watch it if。

 they've never done that before it's crazy to watch how well it works。

 so you roast the smore you do the whole thing then again you know each each。

 of your cities it's a separate thing it's crazy how many cities have this。

 roast you're on some more thing but you know make this。

 applicable to your own thing just use mine as a reference experience and。

 reference anecdote then at certain point I go you want to grab a drink。

 after they've done all this with you they say sure so you go into the bar it's。

 again it's walking distance and then once you walk in that bar obviously。

 you have massive social proof again you have mere exposure the bar。

 tender comes already high fives you oh you want your usual sure the more of a。

 usual kind of frame that you can have with these different people the more。

 stable you appear the more stable that you appear the more trust you're。

 gonna have which then is makes it more likely to go back to your place at， 3 a。m。

 the more likely she is to actually volunteer to volunteer to go。

 back to your place more likely she is to ask you to go back to your place。

 well you have that first drink we never finished the first drink either i'm。

 gonna say it or she's gonna say so what's up with those trampolines or what's。

 going on with the trampoline thing i'm so confused and we'll have a big laugh。

 about the trampoline bit and i go oh you know there's。

 fuck i almost forgot it's almost closed there's only one trampoline。

 place i even know of it's still open and this is right before they start。

 having those like sky zones those jump zone places so it's kind of i don't。

 know you know this one would work as well now because it's kind of funny because。

 i actually have these these establishments but now i told her you know i only。

 know one spot you know it's it's kind of in my neighborhood you still want。

 to do the trampoline thing well she's been thinking about the trampoline。

 things since the second you texted her so she's got emotional investment。

 wrapped up into that trampoline thing even if she hates trampolines or she's。

 not very athletic it's really kind of funny to see how they dress。

 because they're dressing for like a date but they usually don't want to wear。

 heels because of the oftentimes girls wear two pairs of shoes。

 you know one of their purse one on their feet， for this date because they're confused about the whole trampoline thing or。

 they're nervous about it so then what ends up happening is i'm like。

 all right let's let's hop in the car or something or whatever let's go let's go。

 let's go check out the trampoline so we go there and we we go to the you know。

 my house i parked the car and you know at some point she's going to say。

 wait this is a suburb this is your house or yeah i said it was kind of by my。

 house and she goes okay and then she starts talking and as we get out of the， car i go sh shut up。

 all right so by already you know taking a bit of an authority tone。

 and surprising the should over because you know we've had so much fun i'm。

 smiling the whole time i go sh what are you doing， what the fuck。

 oh i am down the girl's gonna go oh i'm so sorry， why are we whispering because you're gonna wake him up。

 what the fuck now she's scared shitless because she's wondering where the。

 fuck are we but again she's wondering where the fuck are we。

 but she we're in a very well-lit suburban area it's a house i'm not。

 i'm not physically touching her almost at all i'm just trying i'm creating。

 this amazing daydream in real life for her i'm creating that tight rope。

 effective helping the girl walk down that tight rope will you be in the net。

 underneath that net underneath is we're not in some creepy alley we're not。

 i'm not trying to like force her into my apartment instead i'm we're in a。

 well-lit suburb and i'm telling her just be quiet it's all i ask of you。

 it's the only thing i'll ever ask of you and our entire future together。

 all right so future projections right and our entire future of us knowing。

 together us knowing each other just be quiet right now please they're。

 gonna wake up i really want to do this， right so then when it's happening is the girls like okay she tiptoes。

 i lift up my mat right i don't see a key i'm like feeling around。

 also i lift up my mat and i'm like oh yes they left it here fucking sweet。

 and that's about the time where she's like i say oh they left it here they left。

 the key here and that's about the time where she's like with a fuck are we。

 she gets like super petrified and i go it'll be fine it'll be okay。

 i go be fine it'll be okay don't worry about it but i'm still like whispering it。

 but i'm whispering i'm like yelling whispering like， it'll be fine don't fucking worry about it。

 right because i want to be a little bit sarcastic i open the door and i。

 get you got everything in game you got to sell it you got to hammer it up。

 it's all about buying right so again the girl's not going to buy in anything。

 that you're not fully bought into you have to drink your own coolate a little。

 bit so when i'm opening the door i i you know it's not like open the door when。

 you know you're going to go into your place where you open the door you walk in i。

 i slowly open the door， oh i it's sometimes creaks i've only been here one。

 of the time i've been here one of the time i haven't been here a while。

 she's probably doing what are we doing and she's freaking out but you're taking。

 the lead on it and it's you're so sure of yourself right you go you walk in。

 all of a sudden you know my cat would run past me i go holy。

 fuck i didn't know that i can't hear let's go let's go and we kind of。

 scurry we close the door very gently obviously i'm in a。

 yellow door for close the door to aggressively even if it's not。

 aggressive again there's no game here and there's kind of game but there's。

 no game i'm literally telling her be quiet whisper。

 i can't find a key they're going to wake up like there's no。

 you know there there's really no i mean i'm myself i'm using sure but i'm not。

 trying to i'm not trying to do anything i'm not trying to。

 act a certain way i'm just setting it up so it's segway's in the next step。

 so we'd scurry through my living room we get to the back we close the door。

 obviously we jump on my trampoline and i go， be still she goes why i don't know i just feel like it's a good idea。

 and i was setting in my roommate which is uh you know one of my。

 pick up mentors at the time he is like we always kind of come on。

 and i go look be very very still be still so they don't see us。

 and i go come here scoot closer or i still see a scoot closer again i'm。

 trying to keep you know i still like no i'm just telling you go scoot closer。

 running it we're gonna call it out right so she's a little bit closer we're。

 sitting next to each other and then the light goes off and i go。

 we made it she goes you're crazy you're fucking crazy i go right no i'm。

 nuts right the point that was not to be crazy， the point is to lead the girl down that tightrope。

 right the segue into the next step now again it's like two three a。m。

 with a chance something sexual is going to happen it's been pretty platonic i。

 even kissed yet but do you know how easy it is to get a kiss。

 from a girl on a trampoline at two three a。m。 like a nice。

 you know 75 degree evening you know super simple you get that kiss。

 and then just let the kid like and then just go back to it。

 now deep comfort story talk to girl about some some shit you guys are。

 passionate about watch the girl just jump on top you can start making out with。

 you after this crazy thing you just did there's other things all right there's。

 i mean so many other things you can do for this the goal again is the。

 sandwich the clothes in between two things that she's definitely down for。

 down for up for other one right so then i would lead the girl up off the。

 trampoline leader inside i'll make as much noise as i want i open the。

 fucking door go hey you want some tea you want something to drink。

 and there was like what shhh quiet she runs for me and tells me to be quiet。

 i go what's your fucking problem and she go and then i i'll pick up my cat。

 you know play pet my cat over the cat it knows me and she goes i don't get it。

 and i'll turn on and i got really clever with this i would turn on a。

 a little entryway light that has like photos of me and the cat and my friends。

 and she'd see the photos and she'd look at me and goes you fucking asshole and she's。

 start like you know kind of punching me and kind of you know play fighting。

 and it's that up and down it's an emotional roller coaster that you're guiding。

 her on again i'm not forcing myself on her i'm not。

 groping on that physically escalating almost no no escalation to all。

 hardly right it's borderline platonic until we get back。

 but i'm doing all this you know in comedy they call it callback humor right i'm。

 doing all this this callback attraction building to previous things in。

 in the interaction where you know in the earlier interaction i'm just i'm。

 building all this trust getting into the place， but i'm also able to then escalate without it being weird and creepy。

 because i made it such a sensual emotionally sensual situation。

 a lot of times when people think about sensuality i think of physicality but。

 you can be emotionally sensual as well where you create this undertone of。

 it's sort of romantic sort of flirty sort of funny but very safe。

 that type of emotional sensuality is very very effective。

 but again remember that tightrope net concept， all right you do this and you'll be able to close just off the logistics of。

 this results。
