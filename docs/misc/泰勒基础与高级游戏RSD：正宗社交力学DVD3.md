# 泰勒基础与高级游戏RSD：正宗社交力学 DVD 3

 Some girls are messed up， Some girls have learned that fighting is a precursor to love。

 Some girls will try to make guys fall in love with them， and you know， string guys along。

 you guys should recognize girls like that， you know。

 don't get involved in relationships with girls that are like that。

 because it will just be a huge headache for you， recognize what's going on there，有你的朋友離職，女兒片來說，娘。

以上的女兒，出奇， Xia Lu'm Wei，想要就是，姜香，不要聽食夢，但是天天，我示的是，對 Joseph，之前在這 Элект西藥 lake，就是我们主要是，在国内有信 Knock там。

因为信请轻炷，因为改革的是，这个球开了，也有什么，就现在，等这集，这么一堆，什么，好，我们，这样，应该对，中国 let me，对空派，而，就是， cancers，各方面，ack，祂，能记住，就是。

要给害，就能记住，所以，老实，你要ster，整理，大家，我們先動一張，KINGRUNES test， sometimes people will try to force you into a role。

 that is not who you are， they will try to put you into a role， into a。

 to create a dynamic between you and them， where you're either trying to impress them。

 where you're trying to qualify yourself to them， where you're being submissive to them。

 things like that， this happens a lot in environments where you know， guys get drunk。

 where girls are acting a bit cocky， things like that that can happen。

 you've got to be prepared for that， you've got to expect that to happen， it's almost like a。

 like a game， it's just kind of funny， some examples， some guy comes up to you and says。

 hey dude dude， you're cool guy man， show me， show me something， show me something， see？。

 once he's trying to do it there， he's trying to， he's trying to get you。

 to try to impress him to put you into that role， a girl might say， are you gonna buy me a drink？。

 if you're gonna talk to me， are you gonna buy me a drink？。

 someone who wouldn't reciprocate it might say， hey go to the store and get me something。

 and you know that they wouldn't do that for you， trying to put you into that role。

 say that a girl who you just meant says， you're gonna pick up line， are you trying to pick me up。

 trying to put you in that frame， as if you want something from her。

 she's trying to put you in that role， maybe she calls you a jerk， when that happens。

 what a lot of guys will do is try to answer logically， but you have to have a line。

 of what kind of behavior you'll respond to logically。

 and what kind of behavior you will basically blow off， what kind of behavior you'll just。

 not even acknowledge it in any logical way， so I came up with sort of a list of different ways。

 that you can respond， one of the kind of wacky things about when I come up with these big lists。

 because you know I'll just think， I'll just sit down and think of the various different ways。

 I have responded in the past， is that a guy will memorize that list。

 and try to unload every last one of them， based on one situation， that's weird， don't do that。

 the more passive the better， so the first one that I said， and this is the most passive one。

 is just to answer straight forwardly， but not be visibly emotionally affected。

 in any way to what they're trying to do， so say guys like， say that a guy said。

 say that you're showing someone pictures for example。

 okay have you guys ever seen situation like this， you're showing your friends some pictures。

 and some cocky guy comes and says， oh pictures， those are cool man， here show me your pictures bro。

 show them to me， come here， show me your pictures， and you're like， okay here it is they're like。

 oh these are awesome buddy， so it's happening there， it's he's trying to put you in a role。

 where you're trying to qualify， where you're trying to qualify yourself。

 and that's what he's trying to put you into， so a passive way of responding that。

 is literally just not showing， any emotional reaction to it。

 like actually just doing what he wants to go， yes sure， here come here， just you know。

 just no emotional reaction， because it will happen， he's expecting you to go submissive。

 in your eye contact， your body language， your voice， and so when you show no。

 when you just show complete indifference to it， he just looks like an idiot。

 he actually just looks kind of hyper， so that's basically that's a， that's a simpler way to do it。

 right， if a girl accuses you， you know you're a jerk， yeah， that's it right。

 no emotional reaction to it， that's important okay， another one this is interesting。

 don't answer at all， just don't answer it， a lot of guys don't realize that。

 you are not required to answer， every question is asked if you want to day-to-day basis。

 if someone asks you something， they're trying to and it's not a legitimate question。

 it's a question where they're trying to put you into a role， just don't answer。

 if you want to get a bit scientific here， what that's conveying。

 is that you have a certain sense of reality， and you're so accustomed to being treated a certain way。

 that when someone says something to you， that's outside of that， you can't even process it。

 it's like it's just it makes such little sense to you， that you just don't answer it。

 that's basically what it's conveying， you give me an example， so anyway the third one。

 is to cut off their thread by not responding， and asserting a new topic of conversation， okay， okay。

 so， well that is basically， you know the， okay when you're meeting a girl。

 she's going to throw these conversational threads at you， she's going to throw stuff at you。

 that it's like a curveball， and it's useless， it's not helping the pickup。

 it's not helping you in any way， it's just moving you away from your goal。

 if she's throwing something at you， this moving you away from what you're trying to do。

 just ignore it， and just talk about something else， they teach this to you in PR， in media training。

 where they say， they'll say answer the question that you wish， you would have been asked。

 so if you're some kind of media mogul， you know you're in the media lot。

 and they ask you something like you know， like for example here's the kind of thing I would probably get。

 say I would go on television， they'll say， are you teaching creepy men to manipulate。

 vulnerable women， which is it's so far， outside of what I'm doing， it's so outside of my reality。

 I don't even know how I would answer that to be honest， because it's just， it's so， weird。

 of a question ask， there's no way that I can respond to that， I have no answer for that。

 so of course， how do you answer， just answer the question you wish that you would have been asked。

 you say， yeah I have a strong passion for helping guys transform themselves， and that's what I do。

 just answer the question you wish you would have been asked， so if a girl says to you。

 pick me up one answer to that is， you're just like， anyway I saw this kid day was really cool right。

 and you know we did this funny thing， you bumped into a garbage can， whatever tell a funny story。

 just， just cut it off， you don't have to answer everything， you don't， get that in your head。

 you do not have to give a logical response to everything you're asked， just cut it off。

 force a new threat of conversation， here's another way， so say that someone， say that someone says。

 can you go get this for me， and you know maybe you'd actually be one to do it。

 you'll yell doing a bit， and you can still do it but you could do it later。

 say that a girl says buy me a drink， maybe you could buy a drink， but make her wait。

 what we're getting at here， is that you're showing that you're in your own reality。

 and you're not responding to everything that's being thrown at you， that's the issue here， next one。

 to answer， almost in the way they want， but to do something that's slightly different and funny。

 so for example， I mean you know very basic， you know if someone says， here come over here。

 right here could you walk towards me， you're just like， yeah sure， like that you know。

 it's just any silliness that shows that you're not like。

 because if they're trying to clown on you they're trying to tool you， just to show。

 that you're not being affected by that， you're not being pulled into it。

 next one to jokingly call them out for trying to step up， like if a girl you know。

 if a girl says something you know call she's your， whoa， you trying to step up， what's up。

 right just plow it like that， you know tease them for it， hey whoa， uh oh， stepping up。

 that's all you got to do， just joke about it just make jokes with it， another great one。

 joke with them that whatever they said， is playing up to an earlier observation。

 that you made about them， that's a great one， say that earlier you said that they're。

 that they're troublemakers， say you call them the girl troublemakers joke。

 and then she says you know she says something， you know what wow， you are troublemaker。

 what that's conveying is that they're basically， playing into the reality that you set。

 it's almost conveying that they have a， we cry out in a way because you call them something。

 and they're just playing into it， so they're just living up to exactly your。

 expectations gives you the position of power， another good one， joke that they're just too powerful。

 for you to handle that they win， that's a great one， like you know if someone throws something。

 and they tell you， some kind of test， whoa， wow， you got me， you win， you're too powerful。

 just too powerful for me to deal with right now， anything like that， anything。

 just not taking too seriously， answer was something， equally random。

 and as absurd as the role that they're trying to put you in， what does that mean。

 that's some completely weird question， just come up with some equally absurd answer。

 don't you don't have to give that the time of day， in any which in any way， shape or form。

 another one answer cryptically， a lot of guys in Hollywood you'll see doing that。

 they get it you know the you know the artsy type， right so I'm asking them questions， like oh yes。

 I'm being real bros， you know they've got to be like yeah， be chill bro， and you know what。

 basically you're trying to figure out what they're saying。

 so they're pulling you into their reality， last couple， to do whatever they want。

 but make them do something first， say that a girl says to you， I don't smoke myself say she says。

 do you have a cigarette， you say sure make your best animal noise。

 make them make the animal noise go you know， that was awesome here。

 like that jokingly imitating them， that's great whatever they said。

 just say it back she says you're a jerk， you're a jerk， my my buddy 26。

 he would take two cigarette cartons， I like this and make them like talking heads。

 and he would imitate their conversation， like I just want to talk to you。

 go back and forth like that， anything imitating them， it's great， give them a weird look。

 just like that， don't respond to give them a weird look， ignore them entirely。

 that's when guys are being or kind of being dicks。

 just a lot of time of guys trying to put you in a role， just ignore it。

 literally just keep talking to your friend， as if you can't even hear what they're saying， last one。

 I gave a lot of examples of it， is misinterpretation， misinterpretation is great， misinterpret。

 they said something entirely different to you， misinterpretation that they complimented you。

 say thank you， I'm glad you like it， misinterpretation they tried to impress you， hey hey whoa。

 im already impressed， you don't have to impress me， you're doing great。

 imitate that they tried to come on， misinterpretation that they tried to come on to you。

 go hey you know what， I'm having a great conversation right now， having a lot of fun。

 but I think we need like more， more confident connection， before we can do something like that， um。

 act as if they were kidding and trying to entertain you， you know she caused you jerk， awesome。

 yeah she's trying to entertain you， uh， another one， you know。

 misinterpret that they said something funny and weird， that they didn't mean to say。

 well I can't have sex with you， I'm sorry， anything weird， another great one。

 misinterpret that they mumbled and that you couldn't hear them。

 so they have to keep repeating it over and over， that's a good one too， what。

 sorry I didn't get that， pardon me， well I'm sorry I'm not hearing you， these are frame reverses。

 notice what I wrote underneath here， because it's important， uh this kind of thing can be。

 one of the most severely misunderstood aspects of social dynamics。

 it's something to be used sparingly， otherwise it comes across。

 immediately as a obnoxious overcompensation， so again， what I've given you guys here is。

 a pretty good list of a variety of different things， that probably people have done to you。

 and think you know ways that you can respond when women throw curveball at you。

 when you're talking to them， a lot of the time when women。

 first talk to you they throw these congruence tests at you to see what you're made of。

 they'll do it quickly the other day I want to bus， I'm playing a video game machine。

 that my friend lent to me， and the girl immediately is like， we've got a video game player here。

 alright what do you guys think that is， immediately that's a congruence test。

 she's throwing that me right away， if I'm like， no my like say that I actually told the truth。

 I don't normally play video games my friend just lent it to me， and I thought I would try it out。

 it's a terrible answer， even if it's true， so I can't remember I probably said something。

 I remember first I just looked at her I was like， just kept playing video games。

 so then of course that that interest her so she's like， she's like she's like so you know。

 why why you all into these video games， I love video games， I love video games。

 I have not left my house， in five years， because of these video I have the strongest thumbs。

 powerful， whatever you know just you know， just say stuff here。

 the point is that's going to hook that interest quickly， when girls first like you oftentimes。

 throw these little pieces at you， and it's the way that you respond to。

 now the thing is some of those responses， they're actually probably a little bit more higher energy。

 than I might even normally go， usually I'll pretty much just。

 if I don't like it I'll just blow it off， it's just the least reactive way as possible。

 because a lot of time when guys use the more fancier techniques， they come across as very reactive。

 they come across as very， kind of you know， so it's actually really horrible。

 I might deal with this on a workshop all the time， and you know after I'm worried。

 so the point is that， have an idea of what you'll respond to， when women throw that stuff at you。

 that's cool that's a good sign that's her way of playing with you。

 play with her back that's a great sign， because the truth is， a woman's not going to say that。

 to some dorky guy， this girl's not like some evil creature， that walks into dorky guys。

 just tooling them for playing video games at random， at least I don't think she is。

 so the point is that she's doing that to you， because she's kind of curious about you。

 she's interested to see what you're about， it's a psychological thing。

 when women will do it when you have a girlfriend， even when you have a girlfriend。

 and she sees some guy that's hotter than you， a lot of the time your girlfriend。

 will come back to you acting bitchy and grumpy， to see what you'll do。

 and if you're a little bit more gentle， that then they lose attraction for you。

 but if you don't show any response to it， and you just think it's funny。

 you play it off like it's very cute， very cute you have that kind of attitude towards it。

 then you come off as strong， and she keeps her attraction for you， in fact。

 you know most girls I've dated， are like that they're very testy。

 and a lot of the time they say as a man， you know a lot of people say this is that you always have to have your own purpose in life。

 outside of your woman， because it really doesn't affect what you're about anyway。

 you always know you can be someone new， so it's fine but just remember that guy。

 okay guys yeah let's do a microphone， what if you're on a date with the girl， and the restaurant。

 she says don't that weight your shirt is cute， how do you act with that。

 she says your shirt is cute， your weight your shirt is cute， how do you act with that。

 you just get your ad fuck them， you know， or you can just go cool， just go cool， just cool whatever。

 don't respond to it， yeah because especially when you have a girlfriend。

 like you can do the whole like yeah I fuck them thing。

 but when you have a girlfriend there's only so many times you can do that。

 so you know before she might want you to， or something， so you want to be， like I'm very passive。

 like with my girlfriend man， I'm just very very passive， she will throw this stuff at me。

 and I'm like look I got a， girlfriend right here， I'm just like I don't even feel it。

 I will act I will tell my if my girlfriend， starts to go crazy I'll say look。

 and this is true by the way I'm not I'm not trying to mess through it anyway。

 I'll say look whatever like argument you want to have， just imagine I'm like answering it all。

 like answering all your questions go have it， and then I come back and hang out。

 and but I don't say the mean way， because all because you know there's especially in a relationship。

 there's also a bounce of showing， if it is legitimate。

 because sometimes the girls coming to you with a legitimate issue。

 you guys will learn this material， but they'll go too far with it， they'll take it too far。

 if their girlfriend has a legitimate issue with them。

 they might you know they think it's all a test， they think everything's a test。

 and they start walking through life thinking everyone's out to test them。

 that's where you get situations like a seminar like this， we're all walking the room。

 and I'll say you know can I borrow that chair， and the guys is like how much will you pay me。

 and I'm like just please give me the chair please， I got to do a seminar here。

 they think I'm testing them， and you wouldn't do what I was saying。

 because he thought I was testing them， so that's like that paranoia， that everything is a test。

 chances are it's probably not a test， it's just that if they're trying to put you into a role。

 and you can see it's like an intentionality behind it， then in that case that's fine。

 generally though you want to be passive with this， you want to be you know as passive as possible。

 really you know the best answer to that， yeah they make sure you're hot cool， you know。

 awesome that's it just no reaction to what's so ever。

 don't let it don't let it don't let it in there， okay because in a lot of way too。

 if you're like if you do the whole like， yeah I fuck a mango。

 if you say it but she can hear that fluctuation in your voice。

 like she hears that in your like in your vocal cords， you kind of shook a bit。

 because you were affected by it， that's where you get that that's where you get into trouble。

 so it should never have that whole， kind of kind of thing behind it。

 it should just be like who you are， it's just your regular answer。

 do we have another question by the way， okay because that's how you grab the mic back。

 so those are congruces guys， the kind of picture， the sort of picture， why don't we do。

 we'll do another quick question yeah， been tested and failed。

 is there something that you can do to recover from that， because I know when I've been tested。

 and it's coming on and sometimes I've passed it， I mean sometimes I failed it and I'm like。

 damn what are some ways that you failed it？， um， I don't know you just get that their energy turns。

 I mean I'm not thinking of a specific issue， you can feel yourself react。

 yeah you know you know you've blown it， it's like oh damn， yeah um。

 is there a recovery from that or do you just say you know it walk away。

 but once that girl's got in her head that you're a chump， it's pretty hard to work out of that。

 I mean she could see with other girls maybe， but see if I tell you to go do that。

 you'll do it from a place in reaction， and you'll be like oh this is going to work my super plan。

 and then she'll feel that too so I mean， she's not working there working to set with a girl。

 and something like that and she gives you a test， she throws it at you and you're like oh damn。

 you know like you miss it， and then you know like recovery。

 you want to know why I don't fail tests that often though， I mean pretty much pretty rarely。

 because I really don't care， do you see what I'm saying， why would I， it doesn't make any sense。

 yeah most of the ways I pass tests， I just ignore it， I just ignore it I'm like oh cool。

 that's it you know who does that， I don't know Trump you see him doing that on TV a lot。

 you see that， I remember he did um he was on like Larry Kanger。

 or one of those shows and the girl came on， she was like she was like Donald Trump。

 why do you feel the need to brag， about your money， why do you feel the need。

 right so you see she's she's， she's putting him into a box， because whatever he says。

 he's qualifying himself to her， and you know Trump this guy， because he really doesn't care。

 this interview could go horrible， will not affect his life， he's like oh， well you know sometimes。

 you know when a business has success， you know like Oprah， you know some businesses。

 like that you know， it gets talked about， but uh， really feel the need to talk about it。

 that's it right， yeah I'm sure the girl is， you know because， you know it's just， doesn't care。

 I saw Trump on Conan O'Brien， and Conan kept trying to， and he was like， Trump does not care。

 she's completely unreacted to it， she does not， unaffected so I think he's kind of，這樣的感覺，傳說模型。

師姐いっぱっ，有擔任的惹人，它真的很好的，那，我考慮沒有孕婦，我們這個，我也知道，你很不爭理，不可以太過渴，沒有，就這樣，也一定，我也可以，但我會說，人家是否懂 一加睿，都有就會和勇敢也聰明。

他 Found His own wife，飛機的人，有一個人，在他棟賢，在他棟賢，有一個人，在他棟賢，那時候，比如說，無尺寸， giant，有一個人，不是，什麼，什麼，OK。

 being good with women isn't about that， that's not what being good with women is about。

 being good with women is just about being a cool guy， who doesn't worry if every woman likes you。

 who's not sweating that， and who just naturally picks up women as he goes along。

 that's what it's about， it's about having that dragnet。

 it's not about like the one little fish you want， just trying to get that one fish。

 it's about that dragnet， of having that natural personality。

 that just comes across to women really well， and women just happen to be attracted to you。

 it's just who you are， you know， and if you've got that one girl who you failed to test with。

 who cares man， who cares， if it goes it goes， if it doesn't it doesn't you know。

 but you can't get you can't you can not get stuck on that， yeah， and that's your best chance。

 and that's your best chance of making it work by the way， is really what I just said。

 I'm not a big fan of， complex structures， for newbies， I used to be more into them。

 I found them useful， but what I find is that people can't remember。

 I find is that people can't remember them， I find people get stuck in their head and there's a lack of retention。

 so what I did， over the last couple of years， was really refined down， the structure that I teach。

 to being， as straightforward as possible， and as potent as possible， what I've listed here。

 is a very very potent formula， for repeated success， it's just。

 it's one of those things that if you do this， it just works， bang bang bang。

 like if you have it down， you could go out to a nightclub。

 and you could approach five women that night， you have five phenomenal interactions。

 and five very solid phone numbers， and probably you could take your pick from among them to。

 you know head out somewhere after the club afterwards。

 this is the formula that I'm going to teach you guys， very very straightforward， it goes like this。

 these are elements of a solid pickup， you don't have to memorize them。

 but I do want you to at least understand them， at least for today， basically goes open， hook， touch。

 vibe， qualify， number of venue change sex， open being， you get the conversation going， hook being。

 you quickly differentiate yourself from the other guys， you got to stand out from them in some way。

 there's got to be something about your personality that stands out， touching。

 we talked about your issue， and about how， you were doing the touching。

 you didn't have the touching going， so that the dynamic isn't there， why do we want to have。

 some kind of physical contact going early， because you want to establish that kind of。

 that kind of interaction style， with that girl， so that when you escalate it's more comfortable。

 viving， that's just sharing stories， shooting the shit， having a great time， qualifying her。

 that is giving her some kind of reason， as to why you'd want to see her again， believe it or not。

 when you start to get better at this， the hardest part is not making the girl attracted to you。

 the hard part is showing her why， she should feel good about going with you。

 what is it about her that you like， that would make her。

 would show her that this is something she'd want to be a part of， phone number， venue change。

 sex you guys know those， so let's get it started， some of you want to go。

 with what's called a wingman， wingman's old， top gun terminology。

 wingman is when you go out with the buddy， going out with the buddy is great。

 if you guys can get a buddy to go out with， it can be a lot like a training partner for a gym。

 it's fantastic， if you cannot get a buddy， don't let that hold you back， absolutely not。

 going out alone is fantastic， it's great， it builds character。

 but it's also a little bit more difficult， when you're starting out。

 so if you can get a wingman great， if not don't worry about it。

 if you do decide to go with a wingman， couple things to keep in mind， most guys。

 when speaking to a girl， we'll be talking to her， and when their wingman comes in， what do they do。

 oh hey what's up buddy， boom back on the girl， it's terrible。

 communicating to kids all the wrong things， if you're talking to a girl， and your wingman comes in。

 do what the girls would do， if you're talking to a girl， and her friends come， you know。

 that you're going to be probably sitting there， with your dick in your hands。

 while she goes to hug her friend， and squeal and cheer。

 whatever when you're just going to be sitting there， you know that。

 we're going to talk about how to deal with that also， so， when your friend comes。

 if you're talking to the girl， immediately turn your body language to the friend， what's up man。

 give him some respect， say hi be happy to see him， he's your friend。

 if you're not happy to be there， with your friend， then your friend suck， what's that say about you。

 so you've got to give him that， you've got to give him that， so hey what's up。

 now you want to quickly catch him up to speed， with the conversation。

 say you know we're just talking about whatever， whatever we're just talking about。

 just say it quickly， the short version， otherwise you'll not off， then give him a big introduction。

 we call that accomplishment intro， accomplishment intro is like old school， pick up stuff。

 okay this goes way back， very very important， whatever it is that you say about him， make it big。

 it's okay to brag about your， you can't brag about yourself， but you can brag about your friend。

 so that's kind of cool， if he's got something cool going on his life， say he did this。

 whatever that cool thing is， great you know， he you know he just， parachuteed recently。

 he's a race car driver， whatever it is， that he is， if it's not that cool， that's okay too。

 it's fine no big deal， you say oh， this is my good friend， you say you know what。

 if your mom knew that you were talking to this man， she would be pissed。

 your mom would not want you to talk， this is a bad man， no don't don't don't say hi， don't do it。

 that kind of thing， it's good， playful， anything like that， but whatever it is。

 you know big up your friend， big them up right， just give him some kind of props。

 another great thing， it's awesome， so awesome， most guys don't do it， joke around with your friend。

 using inside jokes， in front of the girls， it's great， your friend comes in。

 if you know if your buddies， with this guy， you should have some kind of inside joke。

 kind of a style of interaction， that you guys have， do that， if you immediately turn。

 just joke around with your friend， she's going to see that， and it's so funny。

 that she wants to be a part of it， she wants a little piece of that。

 so she's going to try and get in on that， now if you have some kind of inside jokes。

 going on with your friend， and she's reacting， to try to take part in that， what is she doing now。

 she's leaning towards you， she is investing into you， she is reacting to you。

 so you always want to have that， the sort of like those little pieces。

 where you joke around with your buddy， so you guys look like cool guys， most of the time。

 and I'll talk about this later， if I'm with you like one of the RZ boys。

 and we've got girls back at the house， I'm probably talking equally as much， to my friends。

 as I am with the girls， what's that called？， it's called be normal， being a normal guy。

 the girls want to go， with regular cool guys that are having fun。

 they don't want the girls to want to be the party， they want to get led into the party。

 so you've got to be the party， if you and your wing， are having a great time。

 and you're the life of the party， the people in the club can see that， and they want in。

 so many guys， are going around the club， wandering around the club， like stalkers。

 looking around for that， next real， give me a value， I call that value scanning。

 they're value scanning， they want someone else to entertain them， they're like。

 where's some girl I could talk to？， what community is scanning around？。

 if you can't create a vibe inside your own group， how are you going to create a vibe。

 and somebody else's group， you should already be joking around with your friend。

 having a good time shooting the shit， almost you could almost call that， gaming each other。

 in a non gay way， and sort of just shooting the shit with each other， having fun。

 when you see the girls， think of the transition here guys， it's so simple。

 you're already shooting the shit with your friends， you walk by a girl， tap her on the shoulder。

 boom she's writing that conversation， you don't even need an opener， it's a natural thing。

 it's totally natural， you don't need， you know to have that， to have that piece that you go in with。

 if you've already got a friend who you're joking around， if you've merged them into conversations。

 so quickly， it's great， so always be joking around with your friends。

 always give them the body language， always give them that accomplishment introduction。

 give them the respect when he comes in， now there's different dynamics， when there's two guys。

 and two girls， there is a different dynamic going on， than when there's just one guy。

 with two guys and two girls， the way that we'll generally go。

 is the conversation will start as a four-way conversation。

 it's you and your friends are joking around， they're joking around， it's all going back and forth。

 you're all joking around， you're all having fun， what will eventually happen is。

 when the girls buying temperature goes up， the conversation will split。

 splits into two separate conversations， hopefully you and the girl and him and the girl， so。

 you'll see it split， you'll know when you're in a club， you'll know the guys that are。

 you'll see the people that are， quote-unquote picking each other up， because you'll see。

 the two separate， the two very lively conversations。

 because you know that if that's the girl's boyfriend， she's probably not having that much fun。

 so you know that it's that， it's like probably two people who the girls just met。

 the conversation has split， that's how it's going， now let's get to happen。

 remember we talked about girl eye-coding， right how the girls will eye-code。

 what's always happening is this， if one of the friends， is not having fun， and the other one is。

 more often than not， even if the friend likes you， if the friend is growing up。

 your girl will leave， that's how it almost always is， that's how it almost always goes down。

 it's just like when you go back to the house with two girls。

 if one girl wants sex and the other one doesn't， it's quite common。

 that they just both won't have sex， it's not you know there's different situations。

 but it's something that can commonly happen， so when you go in， it's a two-on-two approach。

 usually the way that you usually， you can do one way is to have your one friend， go in on his own。

 warm it up， and then your friend will come in and merge in， that's a very common way， that's good。

 why？， it shows a lot of confidence， the guy went up by himself that's good。

 another way is just to go in with your friend， if you're already joking around。

 you have a great vibe between the two of you， you're already being kind of loud， you're partying。

 you're having fun， merge them in easily， bank very easy， very smooth， that's a great one too。

 you and your friend， you're out with Todd from RSD last night。

 and you know when he's getting the girls phone number。

 I was telling the girl not to give the phone number， saying don't do it， he's bad。

 don't do it don't do it， it just makes her want to give it more。

 I can really see some of you guys misusing that one， messing up and making your friends。

 taking your anger or something， but you know we do do a lot of ball-busting on each other。

 that kind of thing， it's good， it creates that good vibe， the basic power of that is that。

 you're showing that you're not a try-hard， you're showing that you're not some try-hard guy。

 who's so desperate to get in with that girl， that you're having fun。

 she understands that you could walk away at any point， and you still be having fun。

 the girl whenever you speak to a woman， she always has to understand。

 that you're having fun on your own time， and that yes you might be enjoying her company。

 and yes you're drawn to female energy， and that's just the type of guy you are。

 but at the same time if they were gone， you could just be having just as much fun on your own。

 with some other girls， and that you're okay with that， you're comfortable with that。

 it's the most important thing， so the more that you're joking around with your friend， that's great。

 now with that two on two dynamic， you know there's some interesting parts of it。

 when you go to extract， like when you go to take the girls， say from the club， to the restaurant。

 usually both girls have to be into it， that's how it usually goes， it's always that thing。

 sometimes even when you're talking to two girls， you'll see them holding hands back to back like this。

 like that， and like that， and you'll actually see if you're perceptive。

 the one girl will pump the other girl's hand， and the other girl will like double pump the girl's hand back。

 and I've noticed this a lot， and they just， it's like they're both going into state。

 both of their buying temperatures are going up， and they want to know that the other girl。

 is having the same fun， because they don't want their friend to judge them。

 and also because girls put their friends first， usually usually girls will。

 you know when girls go out to a club， it's not necessarily， I mean not to be like paranoid。

 but it's not necessarily the safest environment for them， it's a relatively safe environment。

 but you know they want to look out for each other。

 they want to make sure that nothing crazy happens。

 they've got to make sure that their friends don't get drunk， and go home with some random guys。

 the girls know that their friends buying temperatures， are going up from alcohol。

 dancing all that kind of stuff， and they know that if they don't， quote unquote cock block。

 some guy who's not worthy， that their friend might wind up going home， with some guy。

 and they don't necessarily want to go home with， girls are the kind of。

 creatures that will say things like， they're in a cabin and go， okay we'll go to these guys' house。

 but we have to promise we're not going to have sex with them， they're having to。

 to sort of keep themselves from doing what they want to do。

 so that dynamic there where they're both having fun， and they're both having good time。

 it's very very important， I'm going to talk later about different things that you can do。

 one of them is not having fun because there's different ways that you can handle all sorts of different ways you can handle that。

 the two i'll tell you this though， the two set， like the two guys and two girls。

 has got to be the most consistent， consistent way of having a lot of success with women。

 like it is so consistent， because from a girls perspective， two cool guys。

 that is awesome for girls， because they can go out with them and with total safety。

 you know like it's a situation where it's completely， it's a lot more comfortable and safe for them。

 they're both having fun， no one's judging， so the two cool guys think it's a good situation。

 it's actually so easy， that it can become addictive， you actually want to go out。

 with your wing all the time and do it， that's actually terrible because you should never need a wing。

 you should never be out by yourself a goal my wing is not here， that's horrible。

 but it's a good thing to understand it's a lot of fun， I love going out with just one other guy。

 and having great time， you know it's funny because a lot of people will say。

 that the best way to go out is with a group of girls， you guys see how that can be powerful。

 you're out with a group of girls， and I agree， you know I do it all the time。

 but in a lot of ways I actually enjoy just going out with it， just going out with one other wing。

 because it's so， blindingly efficient， it's just so good， two cool guys， two cool guys is awesome。

 if you view your buddy as being cool， if you view your buddy as being cool， he'll be cool。

 if you're kind of like oh I wish all girls around， with them of course girls will feel that。

 but if you're proud of your friends， that's what it's all about， like if I'm teaching a workshop。

 and the guys that are on that workshop， you know they're new。

 maybe they're a little bit socially awkward， when I'm talking to the girls。

 I will be so proud of those guys， because the girls will think that there must be something amazing about them。

 they're not seeing and they'll want to find out， that's what it's all about。

 it's like you've always got to be proud， even if you're out。

 this even goes we're going to tangen you here， but even if you're a house。

 if you live in a terrible house， it doesn't matter， you've got to be proud of it。

 if you've got a job that sucks， you've got to be proud of it， you've got to talk about it in a way。

 that brings passion to it， but whatever it is， whatever it is in your life。

 be enthusiastic about it， your wingman， your friends， your life， your social circle。

 you should always be talking good stuff， if you ever talk anything negative， or a victim style。

 to grow you just met， you're pretty much blowing yourself out。

 so always have that kind of positivity， let's do a microphone。

 I think we had another question after that too， I was just going to ask you， one guy is talking。

 I'm talking to the girls， and so forth and the other guy， is not doing well or that girl。

 doesn't like that guy， then what's the next， what do you do next？。

 I was going to go into that on the extraction part of the program。

 but I mean the preview is basically， you can either swap， or you can kind of address it。

 there's different ways that you can address it， so we'll get into that。

 but is that an issue that you get sometimes， yeah。

 another obvious answer is just take the phone number， it's not ideal。

 but you could just take the phone number， a lot of times that's what you have to do， but。

 the attitude that you have towards your friend， will help you like I just want a huge rant about。

 and basically， you can also swap up， you can also talk to the girls。

 so we'll get more into that later， the girl code within a set， when they're not having a good time。

 versus like when like you go up， to try to dance with a group or something。

 and then they're all like， well we just want to dance with our friends。

 like what's this like college you're behind， by the way I'm not a big fan of the whole。

 like the kind of like dancing， kind of thing， probably might as well better dance。

 I'd be more into it， I see some guys do though， though it looks kind of cool， but anyway。

 the bad girl code is kind of like， I don't know if you guys could get a closer to this。

 they kind of just， they do one or two things， they give like a weird look like that。

 or they go on like freeze frame， which is very funny when they lock up。

 and they just sit there like， it's like freeze frame， and then you know。

 the girl will see her friend is locked up， see later right， so either the two ones that give you。

 we have to go dance or we have to go the bathroom， and it's funny because as I just said that。

 I actually don't I haven't heard， that I have to go the bathroom or we have to go dance in a long time。

 so you will move past that but I remember， I heard that a lot， I heard that for a long time。

 I definitely encourage a lot of girls to dance， and go to the bathroom my day， so yeah you know。

 it takes， so when they freeze you out right away， when they're all in a group。

 you just want to dance with their friends or what's the psychology feeling then， well they do。

 okay say a girl says to you， you know the other one I got sometimes was like。

 I haven't seen my friend a long time， we're having conversation， you know please go away。

 and it may be true， I mean of course， of course it might be true， but bear in mind。

 if you come in cooler， it would have ceased to be true， so you know I mean， I'm sure that。

 if Matthew McConaughey wanted to dance with them， they might make you know。

 a little space for him to kind of get in， right so that's the thing。

 so like you can't take it personally， it's all， it's shooting basketballs man。

 it's the only way that， that whole old school， success mentality， which goes all the way back。

 like you know the polian hill and guys like that， which are like you know， learning you know。

 you're just modifying， you're never a victim， don't worry about it。

 every rejection is one step closer to a success， all that stuff。

 and that's got to be in that mindset， so it's fine okay， the number one person who's taking more。

 blowouts and rejections， in this room， thank you very much， okay that's the thing。

 I've taken more than anybody， I don't really care， I gotta tell you I really don't care。

 like when I say that I don't care about rejection， I cannot emphasize too much。

 it's ridiculous to care about rejection， it's irrational， is dumb， and if you realize that。

 logically you may not feel emotionally， right you can understand that logically。

 but how it feels is a very different thing， but by going out for a period of time。

 that comes into alignment， it's the same what you remember， when I was old。

 I was probably afraid to go down to laundry room， in the dark laundry room downstairs。

 at some point it maybe four and a half， I said you know what， I know there's no cookie monsters。

 and then jump out of laundry machine， so I'm gonna go down here， and I'm just gonna go。

 and I'm gonna do it， and eventually by doing it， my sense of reality， caught up to that。

 so the idea that rejection doesn't matter， if you keep at it as a man， your guys， you know your men。

 you'll figure it out， most of your relatives， I can assure you。

 whether your British or Greek or Asian， have fought in bloody brutal wars。

 they have been shot and stabbed， and had all sorts of terrible things happen。

 wearing this little shelter， little bubble here， you're out talking to some chicks。

 maybe they aren't friendly， you come equipped to handle this， you come equipped。

 you're born with that， alright so let's go into opening， let's get into opening， the open。

 let's clarify some misconceptions， about the open， warm versus cold approaches， a lot of guys。

 believe that they need， a warm approach， so when they see a girl that they want。

 they will try to establish， eye contact， prior to approaching， by the way some of the guys。

 who do that do have a lot of success， like I've seen。

 and met guys that try to get eye contact first， and have success， that's great。

 awesome but I gotta just gotta speak， from my own experience here， it's absolutely unnecessary。

 there's no reason to wait for eye contact， you know， you're gonna have a traction。

 with intense seconds， regardless， you're gonna have a traction， very very quickly。

 so don't worry about， scoping it out， waiting， you know that kind of thing。

 because that's gonna put you inside your head， that's gonna get you waiting， for that reaction。

 now if you have eye contact， awesome， great， it's just that much more of a bonus， but get my。

 my strongest recommendation， speaking from my own experience， speaking as a guy who probably could。

 approach 100 women tonight， and probably 99 of them， would be fantastic interactions。

 regardless of where it went， just， boom you're there， that's it， you appeared， like an ninja。

 I don't know where， one of the most common things I hear with girls， is just like。

 you just appeared， that's right， that's how it should be， you should just appear， boom you're there。

 hello I'm here， what up， that's how it should go， so don't worry about that， now。

 there's different kind of， takes on how to work a club， there's different ways of looking at it。

 and then hopefully you go to a restaurant， after and then ideally to your house after。

 but you know whatever， another way of looking at this， also very cool。

 is actually to work the whole venue， so that would be like， just talk to different people。

 and then be on your way， bounce around， bounce around is very cool， I think a lot of guys。

 who are used to sort of like， just going in and doing the chatting， just chat chat chat chat。

 when you actually go to like， the bounce around paradigm， it's actually a lot of fun。

 it's that feeling that you really don't want anything from them， and say that you talk to like。

 twenty thirty girls that night， because you're just bouncing bouncing bouncing bouncing。

 like really fast， at least five of them， guaranteed will approach you towards the end of the night。

 and strike up a conversation， with you and offer the numbers， it's really fun。

 my buddy Craig was the first guy that turned me on to that， and was really cool。

 the other side of it，好，行了，行了這個呢，这也是 ingredients I dont comfortable with，所以我行程逍避。

這是 my genius way of opening any girl，ok，ok， 就像這個，你就想出了它，這型的電路，是乾重 這麼單棒，博武功， watch， ready， is cool，ok。

 alright that is not a very friendly girl， alright， not a very attractive girl， yeah， no， no， maybe。

 ok， is cool， ta da， thats it， watch again， ok， and i emphasize this point， ridiculously。

 guys forget it， like that， thats it， just boom， ok， even this， if its through a crowd。

 if theres a girl who wants to talk to you through a crowd， i will even lean through， like that。

 even if they are passing by， girl is passing by， like that， anywhere you go， ok， ok。

 i want stopable， i want stopable， ok， just go， ok， thats how you get it， simple as that， just go in。

 boom， just tap tap， not hard by the way， dont， ok， not scared， just normal， think of operative word。

 for learning， pick a guy， normal， tap tap， like that， immediately when you do that。

 you get attention， you get attention quickly， very very consistent， tap her。

 then you got to say something， ok， ok， ok， see， tap her on the shoulder， never be afraid of that。

 you want to be， when you are out in the club， you want to be in a sort of a state。

 where you are just talking to， whoever you want to talk to， you want to be in that talkative state。

 anyone you want to talk to， just tap on the shoulder， you are good to go。

 notice the next thing that i listed after this， is established dominance， with eye contact。

 and your voice， i probably should have written a body language there too。

 eye contact and voice is really the crucial thing， when you tap the girl on the shoulder。

 and you open， your mouth， she is going to be listening to your voice， for like submissive， nervous。

 fearful tensions， and she is also going to be looking at your eye contact。

 to see if your pupils are dilating， in any kind of way showing that you are nervous。

 if you are not able to hold her eye contact， if you are looking down， i remember。

 when i was actually out of the club， out of the club scene for a while， and i was with Tim。

 one of the RSC instructors， and i had a really rough night， and i couldn't figure out why。

 because i thought i was doing well， and Tim pointed out to me， it was really interesting。

 he said to me， you are looking down， in between your sentences， i was sort of going。

 i was sort of going， like i talk， and in between the sentences， i kind of look down like that。

 and i was like， i was like， are you kidding？， he was like no i think you are doing it。

 and i modified it， and i don't know if it's just， you know， luck or whatever， but， problem solved。

 and i was doing great， okay？， so， so probably that was it， so you want to have that， now of course。

 the newbie mistake， is to have that burning， almost like creepy guy on it， i got a， friend。

 like that， and of course， a lot of this goes back， to that thing that i said earlier。

 about ego defense mechanisms， and also feeling as though， you are not enough。

 and as if you have to somehow， change your behavior， very very drastically。

 in order to be the kind of guy， that gets women， learning how to get women， is not about。

 for most guys， for most of you guys， in here learning to get women。

 is not about changing your behavior， drastically， it's just about those little。

 tweaks that makes the difference， being cool is a very， it's like a subtle kind of thing， it's not。

 it's not like this huge difference， it's a very， it's like these very subtle differences。

 but to get those subtle differences， is harder than it seems。

 if you guys can follow what i'm saying， from that， like to be a cool guy， like the difference。

 you need a guy who gets girls， and doesn't， a lot of the time， you could probably find two guys。

 that look very similar， they act pretty similar， the one guy who acts cool。

 he just got subtle little things， like maybe he just got like， a little sort of style。

 about himself in the way that he dresses， or jokes around， maybe he just can feel vibes。

 well he just communicates， in a very real way， isn't really worried about。

 what people think about him， so he communicates very freely， and that's cool。

 first of the guy who doesn't have that， you know he's just a little bit worried。

 about how people feel about him， but just that little bit of worry， is kind of holding him back。

 and to get past that， it's just that little tweak， that makes all the difference。

 in the results that he's going to get， it's amazing how quickly。

 these little tweaks can make a huge difference， so right when you open。

 you've got that good eye contact， good voice， and when I say good voice， like one of the things。

 that people said about me， see I wasn't born with a deep voice， my voice believe it or not。

 is even deeper， it was a couple of years ago right now， which is not very impressive。

 but I wasn't born with a deep voice， and that's a shame in all， but it doesn't affect me。

 it's very important， but it doesn't affect me， it's fine， it doesn't matter。

 what the women are looking for in your voice， is the way that it resonates。

 in your chest and sort of comes up， in an expressive way， in a way that expresses certainty。

 confidence， fun， positivity， positive is huge， that's really what they're looking for。

 if you look at a group， you look at a group of guys， or group of girls， from across the room。

 now of the group， has a voice that you can hear all the way from across the room。

 but you can't hear anyone else's voices， because they're moderating， and lowering their voices。

 in relation to him， it's a very interesting thing， if you guys learn about voice。

 like if you really focus on it， and when you go out， you look at the voices of guys that are cool。

 it would just be a tremendous education， so focus on that， now when you talk， it's very important。

 you do what's called the no way out rule， something one of the， Mike Jay。

 who took a bootcamp with Mike Jay in here， one of you guys in Australia。

 this is what Mike Jay taught me， something good that he really good mentality that he does。

 he calls it the no way out mentality， and what that is， when he goes in there。

 there is just no way out， of that conversation， there's no possibility。

 we call that a word that I use for that， it's called plowing， and what plowing means。

 is that when you start talking， you just keep talking， until something hits。

 you just keep going until something works， now let me tell you why， what most guys will do。

 is they're coming from a reactive frame， they're coming from a very reactive state of mind。

 and when they approach the girl， and they open the conversation， they very much want。

 for that conversation， to go well， and that's understandable， that's completely understandable。

 but the thing is， this is a stranger， you don't know this girl， and she doesn't know you。

 it's your job to convey your personality， think of it like a goldfish bowl。

 if you just keep talking， you're not even really expecting her to be responsive， you just talk。

 it's like giving her the opportunity to look in， up a goldfish， and see what this goldfish is。

 without being required to do anything， so when you think about plowing， you might think。

 well that's obnoxious， because it kind of is， but at the same time， it's such a power。

 when done properly， anything done wrong， is always going to be obnoxious， even things that are nice。

 but when done properly， what plowing is supposed to be， is say that I start talking。

 and the girls are indifferent， and then maybe I move the conversation， in some other direction。

 and it's something that she's into， you'll see it， it's this amazing thing， across this kind of。

 it's kind of like a hook point， you know this my buddy， Neil has an expression。

 calls it a hook point， and what happens is， it's like that point， where when you cross it。

 the girls want you to stay， more than they want you to leave， if you guys can kind of， compute that。

 it's like that point， where you know you're in， it doesn't mean that you're in for sex。

 it doesn't mean that the girl， you know is going to， is going to drag in the bathroom。

 it just means， that that girl， you've made her night more fun， and she wants you to stay。

 and the way that you accomplish that， is just by continuing to talk， say you know you've。

 you've heard the conversation， to music， puppy dogs， you know whatever it is， and something hits。

 that she likes， and all of a sudden she wants you to stay， and so that's the mind。

 the mindset that you're in， you're enjoying your conversation， and you're not worried。

 too too much about her reaction， and if you just plow through that， you'll be amazed。

 you'll get that reaction， you'll get it eventually， and when you do，， great。

 but you don't depend on it， you want to structure， opportunities to help them talk。

 whenever you can， it's just a point of being polite， one of the old ones that I used to have。

 is I say， hey guys， do girls think the rocks， start David Bowie is hot， I used to ask that。

 because my younger sister， has a poster of David Bowie， up on her wall， and she's kind of young。

 that kind of doesn't make sense to me， you know is that make sense？。

 and you know I think some people， who who read about that， they interpreted that as， you know。

 well you're having to come up， with an excuse to talk to the girl， you're having to come with。

 some kind of excuse to start a conversation， but see， that's just so far outside of my reality。

 because I certainly don't need an excuse， to talk to a woman。

 the reason why I might say something like that， is to give her the excuse to talk to me。

 it's the same reason， as when I say， you know， let's go up to my house， I might say I've got。

 cool home videos there， I'm giving her that reason， that she needs to go up to the house。

 it's the same thing， I'm sort of you know， greasing the joints there， or greasing the wheels。

 I'm trying to give her an opportunity， to throw in any kind of opinion， or anything to say。

 so whenever you can talk to a girl， if you， open if you can give her an opportunity。

 to say something interesting， she's going to love you for it， because you gave her。

 you structured an opportunity， for her to convey her personality to you。

 so you structured an opportunity， for her to let her shine。

 and she's going to appreciate you for that， now sometimes， when you do that， what girls will do。

 is they'll take over， they'll go conversation， tyrant on your ass， they will just take over。

 you've got to be careful about that， because what sometimes will happen， is they'll basically。

 start controlling the conversation on you， so they'll be like， they'll be like。

 yeah I'll give you my opinion on that， and they just start laying down the lawn， and of course。

 when you're new， you kind of like that， because it means you don't have to talk。

 you don't have to think of anything to say， for another 10 seconds， so you're happy。

 it's like getting up on the wave， for an extra 10 seconds， but what that really is。

 it's almost like surfing， and getting up on the wave。

 but you know that you're tipping forward too much， but you're tipping yourself forward。

 as a way to stay on， but you know this is going to result in you falling off。

 it's the same kind of thing， it's like when you approach girls， sometimes what will happen。

 is you'll want to go in super high energy， like hey guys， okay like that， and it works。

 works fantastic， if you go in like that， bang， it'll open， but can you sustain that。

 can you sustain that energy level， it's like going in like a clown， if you go in like a clown。

 you will get a great reaction， but you can't sustain that， it will go away。

 so you're always wanting to moderate， the energy level of the interaction。

 to something that's realistically sustainable， even on the telephone。

 even on the second time that you see her， because if you've got this crazy intense vibe。

 going in the club， it will not be sustainable， I remember when I first came into this。

 when I first started learning， some of the guys who I learned from。

 would just do this intense stuff， and blew me away， I was like wow。

 and then I started to hang out with them more， and I realized they're getting flaked。

 they are getting flaked， left and right， they cannot get women to call them back。

 because what happened was， they generated this huge amount of attraction， in the venue。

 but when they go to call on the phone， and they sound normal， the girls like。

 it's like there's something out of alignment there， and the girl just instinctively pulls away。

 so you want to go in， at a slightly higher energy level than the girls。

 or even at a lower energy level， but being so congruent with it， that they will slow down for you。

 but at the same time， you want to have the good energy， but at the same time。

 it has to be something that's sustainable， throughout the course of the interaction。
