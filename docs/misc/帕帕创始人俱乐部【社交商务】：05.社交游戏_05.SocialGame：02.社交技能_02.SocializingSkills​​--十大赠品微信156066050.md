 and pace and lead through that conversation， to that interaction， People are having that fun vibe。

 contribute to it， Now if you need to like， lead the conversation， and make it like a。

 conversation where you can interact with a certain person。

 You might have to change a vibe from a fun vibe to a business vibe。

 and often times when you go into social settings， and there's people you have to interact with。

 you'll often have to do that， and if you could， you could show that you're cognizant。

 that you're kind of disturbing that social setting，好了，我相信大家看到，比證明動作，都，因為，玉湯郎，不是，你還需要。

那 they want to go back to the group， and that happens because of this lack of understanding of how that social interaction is playing out。

 Now if you are in a group situation， or sometimes where you have to actually move around the group dynamic。

 go from person to person in the group， you're also sometimes required to do so physically。

 that physically you have to get up and walk around to another location， to be closer to that person。

 so you're not crossing communication paths， like you're not talking through people's conversations。

 physically by physically being placed there， and I know that in pick up and you're in a group dynamic。

 and there's a particular girl you're trying to talk to， and there's a lot of people in the group。

 you want to have that girl face you and away from the group。

 if you can so that they're talking more to you， and they're not going to be stuck back into that conversation。

 and that's a great skill to have in almost any social situation。

 and also it's very useful in business situations， when you want to create a situation where it's more difficult for that peer group。

 or a group that they came with， to pull that person away from your 101 conversation。

 where you can really get deep， get a contact information， if it's someone you just met。

 and also build a poor with them， and I think that a lot of people try to protect those people。

 from your social from those people， especially they know who you are。

 and so that's why it's also important for you to befriend that peer group。

 now changing your group tone and focus， from like a group conversation。

 to one of that is more individual， does require a certain dynamic。

 it's a success and in the dynamic， it's usually like you're looking at all the people in the group。

 you're talking to all the people in the group， as opposed to individual conversation。

 looking one-on-one， you're looking very， very intently， you're moving physically into that space。

 and your conversation's very particular specific， it makes it more difficult for other people to get involved。

 in that conversation， because you're talking about particular things。

 about their particular life or your particular life， as opposed to just read on group topics。

 that anyone can contribute to， and it makes it easier to， both are very valuable。

 being able to convey yourself， in a very positive way to a group dynamic， it's extremely powerful。

 just in the same way， it's very powerful to do that appropriately and properly， in a one-on-one。

 where you're especially in a dating environment， you can ask for a great one-on-a-business environment。

 you can close a deal， but you gotta be aware of the others around you， continually。

 you might need to look at what other people are doing in the group。

 even if you're in that one-on-one， because those other people may be looking at you。

 and trying to determine whether it might interfere。

 you'd oftentimes see in a bar and cover special way。

 if you're in a situation where you're trying to pick up a girl， where the girl is out there。

 and you're trying to interact with her， and you can notice the corner of your eye。

 that her friend is about to pour away， in which case you need to create a situation。

 where she's not going to be interested in doing that。

 or just be ready to engage that other person in the conversation， and have a hook or in。

 so she'll give you more time， with that girl that you're interested in picking up。

 the same thing goes in business， the same thing goes all sorts of social dynamic settings。

 you gotta practice this， I mean for most of you guys， who are deep in the pickup。

 you'll notice a lot of the truisms of what I'm saying， however。

 see how all of this applies in the business world as well。

 be cognizant of how comfortable the other party is， you know the body language。

 how open they are to your conversation， your touch or report。

 you're seeking the deeper relationship， you'll notice that。

 from like whether you're looking at eyes more often， and smiling or looking away。

 whether you're touching you， and you can escalate that and mirror that as well。

 you know by just slowly escalating it， more through touch， like touch deeper touch。

 you know facing the more looking away， not just like being that deep stare guy。

 who's just super overly close， in the very beginning， especially people who are introvert。

 if you do that to them， they'll back off further， mirror the behavior of。

 and of the people that you're interacting with， and the openness you want from that or party though。

 and you're more likely to get that from them， so if you're in that open。

 open non-judgmental positive vibe， you're going to get that back， especially in social settings。

 and in business settings， you may get that back， but it's more about intent。

 and more about the logical facts， of what's going on。

 on the other hand there's some people who are in business。

 that are surely doing business based on emotions， and those people usually end up。

 being knocked out of the game of business， quite fast， quite quickly。

 in terms of socializing skills though， these are the things that you want to focus on。
