# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：2.如果你被困在你的头脑里

For you right now if you look at the crowd， is he in his body or in his head？， How can you tell？。

 You can look at the crowd， don't be scared， You look tense， Okay now this look here。

 I'm looking into the audience， Like is this okay am I doing it right？， Is this acceptable？。

 Like that look is the look that I see， in almost every single person's face。

 at the beginning of every single live event， and it's just crazy to think about。

 Like when I walk up on stage in the beginning， and I look into the audience， this is what I see。

 You know it's very rare that I see people who are connected to the world around them。

 who are interacting with the world around them， and it's very rare that I see people who are connected to themselves。

 you know occupying their entire body's feeling， what I see instead is this。

 I see people who are trapped in their heads， trapped in the jail of their mind。

 you know they've escaped the world， must retreat from the world， and they've escaped themselves。

 must retreat from myself， and they are just in this little space here， in this state of anxiety。

 of pain， constant worry， where do I stuck up？， What do people think of me？， Is this okay？。

 Is this okay？， Is this acceptable？， Like that's their existence。

 and this is again due to the way the word conditions， and with PC， this we previously discussed。

 is just getting worse and worse and worse， to the point where almost nothing is acceptable anymore。

 you know if you're born now and you're raised in today's PC world。

 you're taught very fast that this is not okay， that is not okay， don't speak up， don't do that。

 don't put your hand on the table， don't state that opinion， don't say this word。

 and it's just so fucking scary that you just， whew， withdraw from the world completely。

 and you feel just so horrible， there's so much anxiety that you withdraw from yourself。

 you withdraw from the world， you withdraw from yourself， and you're just stuck in this little。

 this last bit of your body， let's just say， stuck in your head， yeah。

 I mean it's just absolutely insane， I see it in the dating world too。

 you know teaching success with women， where more and more guys are coming on these programs。

 and they can't even make themselves heard， you know even sitting on a restaurant with me。

 I'm before having just a casual conversation at a restaurant， I can't hear them， they show up like。

 can't really hear them， like， hey， what's it going？， I can't hear you。

 you're gonna have to speak up， what？， you're gonna have to speak up。

 like we're in a restaurant here， if we go out like say to a bar club。

 like no one's going to hear you， okay， yell， yell， like that's the world that we live in。

 people are just trapped， and you can just see the pain in his eyes， you know， like that， look， just。

 that was me by the way， just， again， that was my entire existence， you know from when I was born。

 that was me， I was always in that state， that three out of ten， you know。

 and when I see this in a crowd， like， I look for people， who just really stand out， like。

 there are different extremes of this， but when I saw him just sitting there， just come on up。

 like those are the people I just immediately bring up front。

 and my goal is to just shake them out of it， it's to wake them up， you know。

 and this is something that's， you know， like he needs an outside force to just wake him up。

 like you need to make someone experience this， for him， more knowledge about the topic too。

 because that's the go-to， it's like， well， I mean， in my head， but some more knowledge is like， no。

 you need someone， an outside force to just shake you the fuck out of it。

 let's do one by one and what you'll see again， like， proof-not promises， I'll go first。

 then try to talk me， I'll go first and try to talk me， okay， just， I'll even start quite like， hey。

 I'll even take this off， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， hey， way lighter， uh-huh。

 try again， solo， hey， even more， just keep trying to top yourself every time， hey， hey， hey， hey。

 even more， even more， come on， come on， even more， one last one， way lighter， come on， right， good。

 so this is an exercise that I love to do， and it just kills it in terms of waking people up。

 you know， getting them out of their heads， is the back and forth yelling， you know。

 where I go first， I'll yell， and I'll have him taught me， and then I'll yell a little bit louder。

 have him taught me， a little bit louder， have him taught me， and then he goes all out。

 and the reason this works so well is because when I go first， it gives him permission。

 that it's okay to go that loud， and you'll see this sometimes in big crowds， you know。

 I remember I was setting up a seminar， room in Canada， in Winnipeg， I believe， or Calgary。

 Winnipeg or Calgary， and I walk in and I'm setting things up。

 and you know people start coming in already， and everyone is super fucking quiet， you know。

 and I'm like， well， you guys can talk， you know， we're gonna start in 15 minutes。

 and they're still extremely fucking quiet， and it's not that they didn't want to talk。

 it's that the norm was just so loud， they're like， is it okay？， No， is it okay？。

 but what happens is as soon as someone speaks up， it gives everyone else permission to speak up to。

 so you just need one to go first， you know， and that's what I do here， by me going first， it's like。

 I guess it's okay， okay， I can go first， and I kind of just bait him that way。

 and then kind of send him off on his own， and he does that amazing， you know， last scream。

 and then of course like to have the crowd， they're supporting you and cheering you on， I mean。

 that's like the positive reference you need， you know， kind of tips that balance of， you know。

 your entire life， don't scream， don't scream， don't be loud， shut the fuck up， here， it's like。

 fuck it， bang， and you just let loose and experience again， that glimpse of authenticity。

 We're not used to even screaming like this， or letting loose ever。

 where I was like holding back and I can guarantee you now。

 it's like although it's like probably scary at first。

 like you're probably like even your posture now， a lot more at ease， no， not perfect。

 but a lot more at ease， you're like oh shit， probably a lot easier that second time。

 probably a lot more freeing and I'm like holy shit， you know， this is the same when like singing。

 a lot of people have like a huge blockage with singing。

 yet when you start to sing and then you realize， nothing bad happens。

 like oh and then kind of get on this flow， look at him now， you know， look at that vibe。

 look at that aura after the scream versus the beginning， you know。

 in the beginning just by doing this little， screaming exercise you see him like this。

 in his head and now it's like hey， wow， you're back in your body。

 back in touch with the world around you， you put yourself out there。

 there's no longer this blockage， you just see that aliveness kind of kick in。

 that light and the pupils just kind of kick in， just by doing that and it's insane， you know。

 just that， like even me now， if I bring my awareness only into my head。

 and observe the difference in the vibe here， if I'm like this， this is me in my head， so yeah。

 I'm in my head right now， you can just sense even the way I talk now， is very um。

 there's not that depth to it， me in my body， so I'm talking now and I'm occupying my entire body。

 there's a little bit more depth， the voice is a little bit more rounded， a little bit more grounded。

 but I'm still cut off from the world and just in my body， now if I put myself out there like okay。

 interacting connected to the world， this is how I talk now。

 and there's even just the smile that automatically kicks in， bang， okay， notice the difference。

 and uh， all， you know， someone needs， is that little bit of a push。

 now just to make it clear here too， this exercise， this doesn't cause any permanent change， okay。

 but what it does do is it gives him that glimpse， it gives him that reminder of what being authentic feels like。

 what he'll then have to do is let go of all the blockage that's there。

 so we're gonna get back to you， but let's just do kind of with the crowd here。

 just to kind of fuck around， let's like split it into， we're gonna do the a， a。

 and basically you'd go first， you top that fucking side。

 then you top them again and we'll just keep going like that， okay， so just， hey like that。

 this side， hey， hey， hey， hey， everyone， good， good， good， that， okay， now， pause， pause， pause。

 that's the reaction by the way that I fucking love， it's like we're doing it。

 it's like everyone together， and notice how a few of you are still inspired to still keep fucking yelling。

 because you're like that， like， it's same as that， you're like， holy shit， I did a bit， nothing bad。

 this feels even more， it's like that's what you're inspired to fucking do。

 and during that last time， especially like you guys being inspired to do it， it's like。

 you're not fucking forcing it， it's not like， ah， willpower， it's like it just comes out， you know。

 and uh， and that's like the ideal here， and I love this， you know。

 it's like we do the exercise with the crowd， and I'm like， okay。

 everyone stop and there's still a few people who keep on yelling。

 and the reason they keep on yelling is they've connected with themselves again。

 they had the glimps of authenticity， the liveliness， and they just don't want to let it go。

 you know， if you've been stifled just walking around in your head for so long。

 and suddenly you have that opportunity to put yourself out there， and you reconnect with yourself。

 you don't want to let that go， it just shows like how in need of this we are， you know。

 and there are really not that many environments either that promote you doing something like this。

 you know， where else are you really going to let loose like this。

 where else are you going to screen like this， you can't do it at your job。

 you can't really do it with your friends， I mean I guess you could do it in the street， you know。

 maybe your house or apartment， but depending on where you're staying， you might， you know。

 your neighbors， my bitch， and this is one of those environments that provide you with the opportunity to really。

 put yourself out there and I love it too because those last screams。

 those are really those genuine authentic screams that come from a place of inspiration， you know。

 it doesn't require effort， you know， the first one is my required effort to kind of get the ball rolling。

 you're like， screen， scream and then it just kicks in and you're like， fuck yeah。

 and you just go with it， those are those authentic screams， now we're going to take it further。

 here we're just doing the screaming， let's do。。。， I'm going to blast some fucking music， I know。

 this is your probably like， fuck this shit， now notice here， okay， catch yourself。

 it's like what are you doing here？， you're trying to warm up to get somewhere， space， can I。。。 no。

 no， no， for now just stand still， look at the crowd， don't escape the crowd。

 and just kind of stay with your emotions for now I get a set up， okay， because notice that too。

 it's like， oh we try to escape it and you're trying to warm up for something。

 it's not something you need to warm up for， it's something you need to unleash。

 it's like it's there once you get out of your own way， effort， like think ego equals effort。

 every time there's effort and it's heavy， it's not coming from the right place， okay。

 now I don't have。。。 what song？， any recommendations？， no， let's get like a dance-yish song。

 this girl by Koon， this girl， is that。。。 wait is that like a Danish thing or no？， this girl？。

 oh by Koon， it's got it， got it， I hope this is good， now， in terms of。。。 let's do this。

 let's just rate it in terms of looseness， okay， in terms of looseness， let's just。。。

 we'll both put like。。。， both arms up when it's like really loose， both arms down when he stiff。

 so you can kind of just garage by the audience， okay， let's go， whatever you feel inspired to do。

 don't even think， just fucking do， and you can do halfway， you can like rate it， now， all right。

 good， now here's what happened， okay， start it off a little tense， then you start seeing， oh。

 a few people raise it， and you did start loosening up， but then you stagnated in those same moves。

 keep。。。 it's all good， keep riding that wave， where it's like every time you're kind of like。。。

 you want to reach that point， you're not even conscious of it， where you're just like， yeah。

 fuck it， it's like， whatever the fuck， it's like， don't try to be cool。

 just like whatever the fuck kind of comes to mind， just do。

 and don't like as soon as you kind of catch yourself be subconscious， be like， yeah， fuck。

 like disrupt that pattern， okay， back at it， going now， even loose， or loose， or loosen。

 you can close your eyes a bit if you want to， like whatever fucking comes to mind。

 the smile is good， that's what you want， you want to smile， be laughing， like， the blast。

 feel free to join in by the way， whatever you guys want to do。

 like try to get that really loose vibe， like fully loose， even looser， smile， you better be smiling。

 now pause， you join him on stage， I can always tell， this is what's like， you can always tell。

 who's still in their fucking head， like everyone's kind of like slowly loosing up。

 and you're just like， yeah， deep breaths， deep breaths， deep breaths。

 so you see that same fucking look in the eyes， like， there's another one， again。

 if you attend that event and I see that， you're coming up， let's start with a couple of yells。

 wait a while， yeah， yeah， now good but forced， I want like that， hey， longer even more。

 it's not forced， it's like， just kind of let go as you yell。

 like even do it with the arms and the smile， hey， hey， hey， even louder， like， join in， let's do。

 hey， hey， hey， hey， that was， hey， a lot better， now you're going back in your head， stay with it。

 stay with it， don't be James Bond， like go with all of this shit。

 it's like you're not trying to be cool， you're like， hey， you're the fat fucking American， like。

 hey， yeah， fuck yeah， hey， hey， just like， again， think fat American opposite Finnish guy。

 don't act like the Finnish guy， be the obnoxious， loud， loose， fat fucking American， hey， hey， hey。

 hey， hey， hey， hey， good， let's get you to dance， okay。

 so he's doing better and what I like about this too is， by me saying， stopping cool。

 stopping James Bond， stop trying to do so well， I'm killing that front that's stifling him。

 and this is important to understand，他在這裏， James Bond 會比較好在這裏，那是一個吸引力的，那是雷彈性的，而我告訴他，吸引力的力量，他會在這裏。

他會在這裏，他會在這裏，我告訴他，我給他一份，我會把吸引力的力量，我會讓他吸引力，我會讓他吸引力，我會讓他吸引力，我會讓他吸引力，我會讓他吸引力，為甚麼這裏 Ku，谎空大めて，我跟你说，我拿了我。

被他扑挡拆他，再重新拼 I say，Oh my God，Oh my God，This is too far out there，I can't，the cool thing about this。

is you hear the crowd，Come on，Come on，There is no escaping this，For him to back out of the situation。

Now that he's up，is more embarrassing，Let's just say，like there's more fear。

than actually going through，So you can use the pressure of the crowd here。

to force him to go through this experience，That'll remind him，of what it's like to be authentic，就是来吧。

 extremely stifled and bang，for like a full fucking minute，or two，that person is there。

but oftentimes it's，kind of back and forth，you know it opens a bit，then it closes，it opens a bit。

and it closes，you know you open a bit，you'll be a little bit loud，and you're like，whoa。

and then you start judging yourself again，and then you close up，but the goal here。

again as I mentioned，is this won't make it permanent，but it will give him that glimpse。

it will give him，that reminder，and that proof that，you know he can do it，he can be loud，it's in him。

and nothing bad happened，we saw little glimpses of it，of him just like。

fuckin letting him lose smiling，it's that，is there，covered up by shit，and you're covering it up。

your entire life，shoving you're subconscious，your entire life，then now it's like。

you just you've forgotten，that that's really you，and what do we do，we tell ourselves。

I don't have this，this is me，and I'm gonna work on getting it，vrs is，letting it out，and until。

as you keep on working on getting it，you're gonna keep reinforcing，this is you，this is your default。

and when as we saw，this is not his default，if that makes sense，I hope you're all following this。

by the way，hi，so，you're good on this one，give yourself some props，because as i see right now。

you're back in your head， judging yourself，yeah，you're good，you're good，same for him，same for him，hi。

hi，yeah，yeah，yeah，yeah，to you， equation，you do whatever you thought， you thought，you。。。，you have to。

you got it，you want it，but blasted the fucking music， as we do this，jule， Logic，jule，jule，jule，jule。

唱歌的聲音，都是很大聲音，很大聲音，所以，一個人很多人有很多聲音，我這兩天是很長的，我記得是一個人，我們都是唱歌，我們都是唱歌，我們都是唱歌，你弄歌的時候，你唱歌的時候，我很遠，著名說。

 here，Don't react， Usually inpalsus like that， who i do like， it means it's something little。

 bit inside of you， that's been suppressing， this for so long， like hugh。

 are you like kind of projected，你是說慕斯廷，你在喉嚇非常尼，有預先。，有…，這よね？，这次免得现自人 life，你看这个人启用，一個adesadelyeorex，來。

Now， by the way， Does anyone feel 沈，由 now like， Fuck I'm glad I'm not here， raise your hand。

 be honest， Yeah， It's pretty f***in' crazy，Now， anyone who feels really， tens about this， It's like。

 We all have that， That's like a sign， Like， You got some s**t， That's like really shoved down there。

 Now it's kinda being triggered like， Oh my God，不知道是否生問題，我會用手袋，就是非常準備，刻意，這樣我們，它的箱子，讓他聽他，让忙，heavy，操，补。

操，好，所以让我们拖一些，不用撞，聖熊，哈哈，哈哈，and here's a song，啊，so you can see also signs of him trying to escape it here。

you know， unlike the first cover it's like no I can't， he's like。

 again making these little jokes like what like this， huh， do you have the， do you know the song？。

 what， uh， uh， uh， do， do like， like this， or trying to not be so focused again。

 these are just signs of him trying to escape， but as we discussed before， you're here。

 you're in front of the crowd， I'm there， there is no escaping， you can try as much as you want。

 to avoid this experience， that will unlock some authenticity， it's not gonna help， now loud。

 so everyone get here， nope， we gotta sing loud to the crowd， good？， keep going， good？， keep going。

 and bad mistakes， bad luck， bad luck， now get it， all right， all right， everyone has a chorus， one。

 two， three， four， three， four， seven， eight， all right， all right， all right， all right， three。

 four， seven， eight， even louder， louder， three， four， seven， eight， louder， three， four， seven。

 eight， all right， all right， all right， all right， all right， all right， all right， three， four。

 seven， eight， all right， on your own， we are the champions again， three， four， seven， eight。

 even louder， assume like that feeling you had， when you were part of the group， fuck the lyrics。

 you can fuck them up， you have my permission to fuck up the lyrics， it doesn't have to be perfect。

 we are the champions， my friends， louder， and we are the champions on fighting， till the end。

 we are the champions， we are the champions， no time for losers， what？， because we are the champions。

 now good？， but you were way louder with the crowd， louder， no， you went everyone was singing。

 you were louder， I want you to tune into that， that feeling when there is no shame。

 you are part of the group， because that's really the way it works， it's like when you do it。

 and everyone fucking joins in， you are like， it's okay， I will not be mocked， I will not be shamed。

 I can finally let it loose， and when you really do it， because now it's like you are back to doing。

 this half-assed， you are still trying to be cool when you do it， it's not really a release。

 but you will feel relief after doing it， most of the time it's like， always suppressing shit。

 so it's like， just think， suppressing， like you sing as a kid， it's like， people are mocking。

 shove it down， you suppress shit， and then you spend your rest of your life。

 just running away from that， and this is how that little voice fucking kicks in。

 you want to talk about self-acceptance？， it's this， until you fully accept， and release。

 and go through an experience， and you have to， suppress， you are always going to be escaping。

 and there's always going to be that little voice， where it's like， okay yeah， you succeeded at that。

 but we all know， you're not good enough， we know， there's parts of you。

 that you should be embarrassed of， ashamed of， that's why we think， it's like。

 well I'm not good enough， but then if I really ask you， why are you not good enough。

 a lot of the time， we're just like， well just cause， like there's no real reason。

 but that's really it， it's going in， to that dark fucking spot， where you just suppress shit。

 where you think， all this stuff's wrong with you， and it's funny， how we even positive things。

 could be wrong with you， singing， laughing， something's wrong with you， and guess what。

 that has been running you， your entire life， and your whole， again， paradigms， built on that。

 that assumption， okay， so what we're doing here， by the way， is instead of escaping it。

 we're learning to express it， okay， and that's good， it's better than nothing， but it's also。

 not fully getting to the cause， okay， expressing is better than， just keeping it suppressed。

 ideally it's going in， and just fully releasing it， so you don't even， have to escape， that's true。

 self-acceptance by the way， it's diving into that， and realizing， there is nothing wrong， with you。

 because until then， you're always going to feel， like there's parts of you， that are unacceptable。

 and that's why you never， feel like you're， enough or complete， you know， and we all have this。

 and this too， it's like， for you it's also， kind of taking in， like you're not。

 the only one who has this， a lot of， fucking people have this， yet it's very easy to think。

 we're the only ones， it's just us， it's just， you're minding you， you little weirdo。

 everyone else laughs， everyone else can sing， like that， that's what we think， you know。

 and we think， well no one will ever accept me， but here it's like， a lot of people are like you。

 the more personal， the more universal， the wound， the more Jones， the more people。

 the more important， say what we like， right？， so what are you， and if we know， something，是不是。

 you have， this， in yourads， Add the， new，那是一条新歌，即使有三个鬼，在亦都看到Bereet， skill你送他们两个运动，那 commander。

当初那些刑处，也过两个运动，我也上生活的，我打的，在的，突然，当客户，当后， Sean Huikia，今晚，在人间ō，却去同理，临，当时，他给老字，都是，不要，知道，那你，就，词污，相，未必，安夸，不。

一天，你， Unutt，不知， Done，太多了， wah， Najше，你看， Now， 覆納，但果然， Richard，你可以找到你，你可以找到你，好，好，那你是不是，如果我回来说你，我说。

你得赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你，或者赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你，你得赚到你， no matter who you are，你得赚到你，你得赚到你， no。

 if she finds out all our dirty little secrets， it's over， okay， and we do this with again。

 like singing， letting loose， we also do this with， you know， anxiety， you can still say don't。

 you're not done， you're not done， I just want you to say， you don't have to qualify yourself， okay。

 because you also have this， by the way， the more you start digging deep。

 there's a fuck ton of resistance， what's your experience， what's your experience。

 what's your experience， okay， no one's out to give you， that's another thing to really realize。

 no one's out to give you， no one's out to shame you， it's not a battle， you versus the crowd。

 or you versus me， it's kind of realizing， oh no one's here， no one's， against each other。

 it's not about being cool， it's not about being right， it's not about not being wrong。

 it's not about not looking like an idiot， it's about being authentic， and I can guarantee you。

 once you let those little， bursts of authenticity out， that's what everyone will connect with。

 no one wants to see some dude， it's like， fucking always like perfect and cool。

 you can sense the fakeness， it's annoying， we're all just here trying to find authenticity。

 and we underestimate the value of authenticity， all the fucking time， that's what we want。

 if you actually even saw him， just like， I totally like voice crack and shit。

 but there was like that realness， it wasn't controlled， it was a little glimpse。

 of him letting loose， that's what I remember， to connect with， and love the way fucking more。

 you know， so we are going to give you do that， but yes， so you mean like， accepting that you like。

 for example when you sing， like in front of everyone， did you are like， not like perfect。

 and you are not like， as low as possible， as you can be， well if you fully accepted， that it's fine。

 not to be perfect， you would be way louder， and that's another interesting thing， it's like。

 we're telling ourselves， okay we're not perfect， let's put an effort to be perfect。

 and here's the difference， there's a reason too， by the way I'm able to talk like this。

 like the mic's unplugged right now， and you can probably hear me， all the way to the back。

 I'm not forcing shit right now， it's not like I'm like， so I'm talking right now。

 really loud so everyone can hear me， so I'm talking right now， really loud， so everyone can hear me。

 it's loose， you want to get really loud， you can't fucking force that shit， it has to be loose。

 and then you'll see it， like comes out， and that's why you talk about， even like。

 hustle coming from abundance， like we're always， putting in so much effort。

 to like hustle hustle hustle hustle， if you're loose， holy shit， can you go way harder。

 and for way longer， like when you're， going to go way harder and for way longer。

 like right now if I came up， on stage and this still happens， by the way。

 there's still that little belief， where it's like， here's the crowd， let's fucking win the crowd。

 over let's do this， and you've seen， probably seminar's like that， where I come up on stage。

 and I'm like， oh like that， they're good， but， this is the stuff。

 that's a lot loose and more powerful， and this requires no， fucking effort。

 because the other one is， like you're battling， it's like， you're still trying to be cool。

 just let go of it all， and the same is like，the same as like trusting inspiration we'll kick in。

you gotta trust that lowness we'll fucking kick in， so this is really the outer approach。

 you know and i combine the two， i'll do this and then i'll have him sit down for example and。

 go through the process of letting go，不但为什么不下来。
