 ensuring your life， just like how we do it， because then people could get to know you。

 and even if they're not in the same city， or your old friends， they could follow you。。

 So I think it's really important for you to do this。， The factors， services。

 reconnect all your social media into one text message。。

 And so when I was traveling around the world， I was in one text message。

 and we would go to all my social media， at the same time。， I'm sure you could find it。

 because I don't use it anymore， so I couldn't tell you the exact name。。

 But I'm trying to convey though，， is you want to automate a system， so do you have more time。

 for your personal professional growth？， And by creating enough social value。

 or the presence that you have a lot to value in your life， to other people。

 through these various means of presenting yourself， to the world，， you're developing that brand，。

 that personal brand in vision， or that business brand in vision， so that people are interested。

 in doing business with you，， gain a know you， or developing a personal relationship with you。。

 I know for a fact， that any girl you're seriously interested in dating。

 not just the one I'd stand typically， but girls that are interested。

 in actually dating you recurrently， will be doing research， on your social media， if you have any。。

 I personally have limited my social media， because I want to stay in the private sector。

 most of the time， or behind the scenes， but I'm changing a lot of that as well。

 and I'm having to actually get back into this as well。， But I mean，。

 I have a lot of passion for this。， I think it's really， really fun。。

 It gives you a sense of freedom。， We can even convey who you are，， all sorts of interesting things。。

 I love the innovation。， It's kind of， is an escape， from the typical mundane business。。

 We're most businesses， that kind of have the same structure， and any job。， A lot of it。

 has a lot of those things， that really suck。， But the things that are creative， and innovative。

 are the things， that I appreciate the most。， And being what I like to express， artistically。

 a lot of these things， is really important。， I've always looked， for those things。

 that lie to convey art。， My mom is an art major， she's a master in art。， And I was always taught。

 to like create art at home。， And I was even like a six-year-old， till I was 12，， just for fun。。

 And I think a lot of that， passion and creativity， inspired me to continue。

 to think outside of books， even for business。， Or thinking about， things in new ways。

 or trying to fantasize， and glamorize， a lot of things that we do。， From day one，。

 Real Source Dynamics， was all about that。， All about trying to create， this really fascinating，。

 creative，， free mind， outside of the box， thought process。， Which is what， Tyra calls。

 cring a movement。， I know that， creating a， whether it's a religious movement。

 or a political movement， or a belief system， or a meme， that's going to be， the most powerful thing。

 anyone could do。， And Tyra wanted to do that， for the belief systems， that could teach you。

 not just pick up， because if we wanted， to just teach pick up，， we would have car， ourselves。

 dating dynamics。， But all aspects， of your social， and business life， and professional life。

 and using the skills， you could learn to pick up girls。， Which is one of the most。

 challenging and sophisticated， skills， even though pick up， maybe match-weaf。， For a lot of people。

 there's a lot of dynamics， in ways， that you can study， and break it down， into a science。

 and make it fastening， and fun。， And as a result，， we car ourselves， real social dynamics。

 for just that purpose。， A lot of the things， that we do， is always focused， though，。

 not just in terms， of the dynamics in general， but on how it helps you，， the person。。

 So what talk about， the features of a program？， Have you read our sales materials。

 or if you watch our YouTube videos？， We always talk about， how what we're talking about。

 benefits you，， the customer，， you the student。， The same thing goes， when you're interacting。

 with other people， on a social level， or on a business level。， You always want to talk about。

 those things， that you might be doing。， Those things， that might be fun。， But always think about。

 what you're talking about， might be able to benefit them， whether it's going to be。

 captivating with them， with a fun story。， Captivating the excitement， or imagination。。

 Or sharing with them， something that you know， is going to help them， because you know。

 what your goals， or your dreams are， and your vision are。， I do a lot of that。

 in my relationship talk， about getting life。， I think it's really useful。

 to do it in your social life as well。， In fact，， a lot of my business contacts。

 just from doing that one thing。， Then turn into personal contacts。， People who now will。

 give me business services， for free just from doing this kind of thing。， It's kind of like。

 your unique sewing proposition。， Whether， in the business world， they call it a USP，。

 unique sewing proposition。， What makes you different， from everyone else？， What makes you stand out？

， You know，， what is it that makes RSD， stands out is that we have this， cutting edge technology。

 in terms of dating， and education。， And we share it， in a very unique way。， Real world experience。

 is very difficult to capture， and we capture it。， Share it in video format， and also live programs。

 all over the world。， In your personal life，， do you think about， what your USP is？。

 Are you that massive networker？， Are you the guy， who's really， interested in that unique， passion，。

 whether it's like video games， or surfing or something unique？， Are you just like the quiet guy。

 but you're like that good guy， who really is like， a loyal trustworthy guy， who will hang around。

 and be your wingman？， You've got to figure out， what that is for you。。

 How are you going to present yourself， with your soul circle， and your social life。

 so that you're viewed， in that unique way， the way that you want to be， conveyed to other people。

 that you think other people， are going to want to， be more around you more often。
