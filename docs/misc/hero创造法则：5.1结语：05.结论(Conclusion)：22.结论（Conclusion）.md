 always be at peace to always be positive， to never be judging， to always be grateful。

 to never come from scarcity， et cetera et cetera， it's not this。

 let's run away from this and get there， let's run away from hanging on to things。

 and get to that point， where you never hang on to anything， it's about accepting everything。

 that's how you let go， let go is not to get somewhere， it's let go of trying to get somewhere。

 there's nowhere to get，OK，and again this ideal of，你的 light minutes perfection，No one is there。

and even if someone is in that state there， it's not in light minutes。

 because now they fear the opposite， what we're aiming for here， does not have an opposite，OK。

 perfection if you will， is letting go of perfection，and with this practice too。

 don't be so serious about it，you know， it's like，and I'm going to hurry，and it's very serious。

 until when do I reach that goal， fuck， hate myself until I get there，No，OK， fuck that goal。

 that's not what it's about， it's not about being serious， hating yourself， must be perfect。

 must be perfect fast， must do everything perfectly， must do this all the time，No，OK。

 it's a serious matter， but you can't do it in such a serious way，OK， remember coming from abundance。

 really thriving， is when you're， alive and enjoying life， and there's that light in the pupil。

 and you're just radiating， just like， you're there， that presence， it's not， let's do this。

 let's let go， fuck that， that's coming from scarcity，OK， don't be so， serious and miserable。

and what you realize is that， the more， awake you become， the more you laugh。

 there's one way of kind of seeing， where you're out on the journey， how much are you laughing。

 how much are you smiling， how much of the light， is there in your eyes。

 versus how disciplined you are， and， again the way you should view this is， it's a way of life。

 it's not， they sprint towards an end goal， there is no end goal。

 it's a way of life where you just continuously， let go of that fucking end goal，OK， make this。

 a practice， make this a habit， it's just something that you do， you can do it in the morning。

 you can do it in the evening， as you'll see in the next section， there's a， guided morning release。

 and a guided evening release， and just keep doing those。

 and just do them for the sake of doing them，OK enjoy bringing awareness to， those parts of you that。

 you haven't brought awareness to， you know enjoy rediscovering yourself， and all the while too。

 it's like you already have that knowing that you're there， you have that proof。

 it's like you're there， and these habits are not meant to be， little tools to get somewhere。

 it's just， sometimes you can spend with yourself， reconnecting to that state of abundance。

 that's what it is， you're not doing it to achieve something。

 you're doing it for the sake of doing it，OK， and you already have that knowing。

 and from there every single day， just enjoy， getting back in touch with that， and amplifying。

 that knowing even more， there is no destination， if you hang onto that destination。

 you'll just end up trapped， let go of the destination， you're there， you've made it。

 stop telling yourself you haven't made it， drop that paradigm， and this， is transformation mastery。

 this is what changed my life， I mean， as I mentioned before， I first got into。

 this whole world of self-help personal development， back in 2006。

 so I've been in this for over 10 years， and if you look at my journey， the past two years since。

 that media scandal， and since， I became aware of all， this and started working on this。

 my transformation these past two years， tops those first eight years， in those first eight years。

 I went all out， there was a lot of effort， a lot of just really hustling。

 and just trying to optimize everything， like I went all out， but those eight years。

 which is the past two years， I mean you can't even compare， that the personal transformation。

 I experienced the past two years， has been so drastic， nothing compares with it， and， I mean yeah。

 this is why I created this， for you to， you know， transform that same way there。

 and what it realizes that hey， when you start getting to the cause。

 when you stop fiddling around with the effects， when you apply this。

 transformation will just be fucking effortless， and it will happen fast。
