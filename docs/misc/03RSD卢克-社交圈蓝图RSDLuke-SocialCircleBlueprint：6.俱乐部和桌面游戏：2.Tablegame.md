# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：6. 俱乐部和桌面游戏：2. Table game

我认为有那么多人完了，在什么团结关于什么，所以自己我还能解释，因为，我发挥出道，到了就是，我使我日常好好调整，因为我 onze，说的是什么，这次来了，保证，你是 现在的，今天的教练。

我常常感到要來 convince people why that's such an important concept， before they're just like， oh。

 but I don't want to know about that high value money type stuff， It's kind of interesting。

 Take a seat like Vegas， that's the second one I was going to mention， The bottle service， money。

 flashy， everything， It's crazy how many people locals that I know will value their car at a club like when they're going to a club like XS。

 where second floor parking at the Wynn for example， you get 30-40 feet from the entrance to XS。

 but they still want a valet because they still want that like something for nothing kind of approach。

 where like you don't have to pay for the valet but you still get this kind of image that's associated with it a little bit。

 Some venues aren't like that but you take XS and I would never value my car when I'm trying to go to XS。

 It's just ridiculous， The second floor parking， you can walk the girl 30 feet from the exit of XS and you're in your car。

 So you got the bottle service thing， So let's look at a few examples of that right because it's Vegas。

 It's not just bottle service， what is it right？， Social status， Social status。

 so it's bottle service， social status， where are some other things in Vegas that。

 because you think there is a massive winning-roll approach to game。

 You can't really just go against the grain so much just to be different。

 That's the problem that a lot of guys get with the whole self-emusement thing。

 They get it wrong with the different high-value things。

 They think that it's just going against the grain that's going to get them the result， Instead。

 you really have to look at it like you know you take a seat like Vegas。

 I don't want to give away the first one， I want someone to answer it。

 But the high-status high-value kind of approach， right？， We'll give you a few of the other things。

 You have bottle service areas， just share quantity of bottles， what else you have？。

 Maybe conforming to a certain dress code if that's not really your style， Sure。

 so what's the typical Vegas high-value dress code？， A little bit what you're doing right here， Cool。

 a darker， usually more of a darker thing underneath is a little more business than it is。

 And it's casual but yeah， the suit， the pocket square。

 You look like a guy who stands right outside the nightclub， VIP host kind of thing， What else？

 What are the high-value things of Vegas？， Besides the bottle service。

 so that's just such an easy win， right？， What else？， Cool， we're going to get。。。。

 Where are the guys eating dinner？， Where are you eating dinner？ That's a huge one for Vegas。

 There you go， see？， There you go， all these things， right？。

 What I like about game is you can get all of these things without just having to be somebody who goes out and just spends a ton of money。

 That's kind of the point of game is this high leverage kind of situation that you create for yourselves。

 The specific thing about the bottle service， that's one of the biggest bang for your bucks that you can use as a picker-bottom。

 as a guy who's trying to go out there and use game to crush it。

 Because you take a city like Seattle， right？ And you be living in Seattle before or anybody？， No。

 you said something about up there， right？， Portland， okay。

 So Seattle is not a bottle service kind of area， San Francisco。

 I've lived in San Francisco for a year at a time， San Francisco is one of the。。。。

 San Francisco to me is the coolest city that you could possibly live in that also has the worst quality of girls you could possibly have。

 Like you look at that like ratio and like the attractiveness level of your girl compared to the bomb ass restaurants and different cool things in the city。

 It's like I've never seen such a disparity， it's crazy。 But the bottle service thing。

 it's almost looked down upon to give the bottle service in San Francisco， It's almost this weird。

 what are you doing， what are you guys celebrating， why are you spending this mic？。

 Because everybody kind of makes decent money there。

 but nobody really wants to spend it on that kind of stuff， right？。

 You know there's like what two bottle service clubs really in the city， I mean Temple Audio。

 maybe Harlett， I guess three bottle service cities， Yeah， Temple Hall at an audio。

 Temple is great if you love really Fabi Asian girls， San Francisco， right？。

 You know I mean Harlett is probably the best club at the end of the day， audio is kind of cool too。

 but be honest， you kind of have to look at this way， When I go through these different talks。

 these different cities， we do free tours， it's really clear。

 The guys that are in the room for the most part of the guys that either think that they don't have or genuinely don't have the characteristics of all the naturals in that city。

 Right， so you know what I am， Miami， Miami is all like Miami that when I say these things I'm not trying to talk about absolute。

 I'm just saying with the natural approaches in that city or the mainstream approach in that city of getting girls。

 Miami is a city where it's purely about money， in terms of the mainstream approach to pick up girls。

 It's all about what type of car do you drive， it's even more than like Manhattan， Miami is just。

 there's like who， what， why， and where questions are asked right away。

 So you look at the layer in Miami， the layer in our circle， whatever you want to call it。

 in Miami is full of a bunch of guys who don't really want to work。

 There are a bunch of guys that don't really want to play the value card。

 like it's full of all these guys that are like that， You're a city like LA， right。

 what do you think the guys in that room are like？， Yeah， so a lot of we， I mean that's like。

 that's the entire state of California， they're just bakes all the time。

 I would be looking at 100% of social connections， Yeah， you would be right。

 so he really hit the knee on the head， I think it was you， right？， So like。

 it's like half the room are AV guys， guys who work in audio visual， maybe that guy was Michael。

 was his name I think I think he might have met him。

 It's guys who like move LA thinking they want to work in the industry or the entertainment。

 you know about this， right？， First hand， it's guys who like think that they're going to take acting classes。

 become an actor， people who are in that entertainment industry。

 They kind of thought that that was the path to get good with women。

 I have a lot of friends who live in Vegas because they thought they wanted to pick up girls in LA as a part-time actor。

 realized they didn't really like acting at all， they just wanted that like lifestyle。

 And they realized they could have that lifestyle on day one moving to Vegas。

 so then they just drove four hours over here and then said fuck LA。

 Well it's one of the first things I teach everybody that comes to me and trains with me in Vegas is how to always make sure that they're at Comptables or Comptables or some tourist table。

 As much as possible as often as possible because you can spend four hours gaming in a low-value area and gaming really really well。

 And you'll never get the quality of girl that you have with average or even a little bit below average game in a really high-value area。

 I go to almost every playboy mansion party， I go to almost every maximum party and while I'm there I actually have like usually pretty low energy when I'm there which isn't kind of my style。

 I'm usually kind of like the high energy crazy guy。

 So when I'm in those areas I use like average level game in those places and it's always way hotter type of girls that were pulling。

 Anybody see my videos on YouTube？ Anybody see them or you haven't seen any of my videos？。

 What do you do know， it's not a track-less level of the girls in my videos or just significantly hotter than a lot of pickup videos？

， Yeah， it's not like film those and that's because the girls at those events even like with your average level game you are on like a bad day。

 You're still going to pull a lot hotter girl at a high-value event or a high-value thing like a bottle service area in a club of egos。

 Then you will using much better game at a low-value area。 You guys understand that？。

 You can get into those things by just changing some habits of yours。

 It's not like you have to go out and exert all of this high-value onto the world instead really what you should do is use the techniques to get into these areas to build yourself and your standing in these different environments。

 And then actually DLV yourself。 That's the best combination， that's the sweet spot。

 So the best thing you could do is get into these table areas the way he starts that he's discussing or where you just mentioned。

 Not only table areas but what are a couple other VIP kind of things， Events， what？ The Cabana area？

 Yeah， like at the pool areas right？ Cabana and that， those opened it。

 I mean I love being like the most out of shape guy at the pool and like talking to the hottest girls at the pools。

 Pulling the hottest girls at the pools and like me be like me trying to keep my pale skin。

 Like me like pulling back a little bit because I don't want to be in the sun because I don't want like want the wrinkles。

 So like I'm trying to like stand and I'm like I just can't be in a sun for very long。

 I'm like trying to like get out of the sun， I'm wearing like a full shirt and I'm like hitting on these girls and like in the Cabana area。

 And it's and I'm like literally DLVing myself the whole time。

 Because most guys who are in that high-value areas are trying to do what？， Show off bragg。

 qualify themselves， right？， So when you're in that area and you're clearly and you're clearly trying to belittle yourself almost。

 And like a sarcastic kind of way， I'm literally describing how like I just can't afford to be here。

 I'm describing how I really don't want to I don't want to tan because I don't want I don't want the sun exposure。

 I don't want skin cancer， it's really just for my health。

 Like I'm almost saying there's like dorky geeky comments that are DLVs demonstrations of lower value。

 And what ends up happening is when the girls see that when you're in the VIP area but you're talking about how you can't afford to be there。

 The girl that immediately thinks that you're higher value than everybody else there because you're saying those comments。

 Does that make sense？ You're going completely opposite to what these other guys are doing where they're just trying to show off consistently。

 Do you guys have anybody to know？ I snuck it into one of my videos。

 But do you know the number one opener on really really attractive girls？。

 It's so who do you know here？ Right？ So who do you know here？。

 Because wherever there's a really attractive girl， she's in a social circle of some sort。

 But so I stayed at an opener on really really attractive girls， Oh so who do you know here？。

 And then immediately she starts qualifying about who she knows and why she belongs in this area。

 Because only someone else of the high value would I will go up to groups that I don't know。

 This is like one of my specialties getting into like really high value areas and having no business being there。

 Just so I don't forget one of my I fail else to all the Vegas immersion guys。

 Well those you guys see the easiest opener at a table area is to walk up to a group of whoever's at a table。

 And say hey what up table neighbor where you guys from？， Right。

 When you say hey what up table neighbor what is that imply？， That you have a table in the vicinity。

 I'll go up I'm kind of that's I'm kind of crazy， I'll go up and I'll grab bottles off of another table。

 Like I'll go grab like an empty bottle of goose off some dudes table。

 So grab it like like swing it around a little bit I would say 90% of the nights I go out I'm completely sober。

 And 10% I'm lit as fuck I have no like I have no like buzzed。

 There's no in between whatsoever it's just like yeah real fucking great， Real fucking great right。

 I'm like like 10% of times just like complete like barely even know what club I'm in right。

 Probably will forget which like where I parked I definitely ubered home。

 But night percent time I'm sober and I'm sober sometimes I'll grab like an empty bottle of goose。

 I like walk around to some table and be like hey we got table neighbor。

 And like usually there's just a little bit in it so like I'll just pour it into their glass。

 I'm like oh let's get lit I'm just like getting part like I'm just trying to like party and rage。

 Right I'll pour it in there and then immediately they're like yeah come on by I have a seat and meet all of our people。

 The thing is guys are so eat like that's the like mix sets especially they're so easy。

 Like you go up like and just say hey hey what up and like try to hit on their girl。

 And some like polarizing or alpha kind of way immediately they're gonna be like you'll get the fuck away。

 You pour like four to half dollars worth of vodka in their drink or like you walk up and say table neighbor。

 And don't do the balls the alcohol thing I just described。

 They think that you don't want anything from them so then immediately they're like oh here's the key to the castle right here。

 Right so you walk up and you say what up table neighbor you're now immediately in that area。

 And you can usually just stay in that area they'll usually pour you drinks they'll introduce you to the girls。

 And as long as you guys are so easy as long as you don't hit on the immediate girl that he wants to fuck。

 You could hit on any of the other girls and they're totally fine right it's totally fine。

 I have sheets that have the exact map and layout of every nightclub in Vegas with which number they're all at。

 So the way that that's beneficial is you know exactly what table number you need to go to if there's an area。

 Do you guys notice that there's like no other VIP tables there's also VIP areas。

 Right you have like some big someone guy will be like guarding like an area。

 If you say if you know the table number of the area they don't ask you any questions。

 And in fact they'll lead you to exactly the table like your VIP。

 Right so if you just know what table number is of the area I don't even need to like sit at a table。

 In fact I usually have tables and invites all the time when I go out and I never sit there because I don't be so stationary。

 Which I think is just I get super bored if I have to be stuck in that one spot。

 Even with a bunch of really pretty girls I'm like no I want to like move around a little bit right。

 However if you know exactly what table number a certain table is they'll put you into the VIP area and lead you like your VIP or like a king。

 And then as long as you just stay active and stay social they won't ever move you from that area。

 Because I understand that so every table has a corresponding table number with the name of the person who bought the table。

 The number is significantly more important than the name of the person who bought the table ever。

 As long as I understand that the numbers are very very important。

 I'll regularly go into the into like omnium for example and say I'm at table 53。

 Right and then they'll go oh okay because they see that you know the verbiage of that table。

 They will just walk you straight to the table they'll push everyone out of the way and bring you straight to that table。

 You mean I'd walk up to the first friendly guy I see him like hey what up just high five them。

 The bounce will see that high five happen bounce will walk away and I'll be like what up table neighbor and I'm at the table。

 And neither one it was the wiser， Yes if you have balls then do the DJ boot tables。

 Yeah I mean like excess I've maybe for the past two years I've never gone into excess and not sat next to the DJ。

 Maybe the past two and a half years maybe， And I spend three four months not going to excess sometimes and every time I come back。

 I don't even look at excess as a big club I look at as it's like one mini club and that's that deck area with the DJ boot is excess。

 That's like I would love to just see like nothing but P-rays up there。

 That'd be super cool if like every single P-ray was just able to just say the same things that I say to get there and just do it。

 Just know what you're exactly to do it Drew just gave you a really good tip on how to do that。

 Right just make sure you say the table number of that table and they'll just lead you right to it as if you were wrong。

 Here's the thing first of all not no there's like I best if five percent of this room did it that would be amazing。

 Right I've told this exact same thing over and over and over again for many different groups of people and almost never do I see anybody up there。

 The goal is me teach you how to get to the DJ booth and instead I see all of you in like the VIP dance floor table area。

 That would be pretty cool and that's extremely doable。

 Extremely doable like on most nights it's like 20% of the club maybe are free bottles。

 comp tables anyway， These comp tables like my buddy is a comp table every night he goes out and he's got a new batch of 10。

 Reasoned I'll get to you a second reasonably attractive girls at his table he never knows who the girls are。

 They just and he's a DJ every so he's a promoter basically for the first half of the night and then he's a DJ the second half of the night。

 He cares only about his DJing but he's not a big enough DJ to be anything but like the clue。

 He's the guy like DJ with like they're like sweeping and everyone like kicks everybody else out。

 So Dylan Francis DJs for 17 minutes and then he gets off stage and then this guy comes back comes on at DJs。

 So he doesn't give a fuck about the table the alcohol or the girls at the spot。

 So you might not be able to get into the DJ booth every time but when 100% of the nights you go out you should be able to get to one of these comp tables。

 One of these industry tables one of these areas you get to drink for free you get to head on their girls because they don't even care about the girls。

 Most guys who work at clubs in Vegas are annoyed by the girls because their girls are commodity here meaning that there's just so many of them。

 Like if you walk up to one of the biggest myths ever in the pickup community is you want to try to get into a nightclub。

 Walk up the club with a bunch of girls and they're gonna be so impressed or enamored with you I guess。

 They're gonna let you in that's such a joke I mean you've done that right where you walk up to go to a bunch of girls。

 And what do they usually say if you don't know them？。

 If you don't know the door guy or host or whatever yeah what do they say？。

 Yeah fuck off or are you ready to pay cover for all of you people？。

 Like they're not like I'm impressed at all even even like my buddies when I walk up they're kind of like bro dude。

 All right I guess I'll write a slip for all these people like they're kind of slightly annoyed or vexed more than anything。

 Right I'm much more than the nightclubs completely by myself and then meet up with the girls inside the club。

 Right because it's just it's just not it doesn't impress them it's like the women are commodity they're just so many girls。

 Right so the DJ booth yeah that might be difficult but I will say this I've definitely had like 10 to 15。

 P。A。s at the access DJ booth and last day DJ booth I mean like so there's the DJ booth and then there's the DJ booth tables that are next to the DJ booth。

 Does that make sense？ I've definitely had about 10 to 15 P。A。

s with me in that area before because as long as you're thinking about it。

 Like everything that defines like a reasonably good P。A。

 or at least the things you're striving for are the exact same characteristics of a guy that they want there anyway。

 It's crazy how many text messages I get per day saying hey do you know any cool guys I have too many girls at our table。

 We I need some cool guys to entertain them right minimum once a day I get that sometimes I go out all life。

 If I'm on a streak going out a lot I get like three of those messages a day of these guys who just get always referrals of girls。

 Right here this is the way like hack Vegas don't be some guy who like goes to fashion show and does like day game or something。

 Like it's just your quantity of girl like you guys have done that as something or I mean I've been fashion show them all like three days a week。

 four days a week now， They're all the time and like I like maybe once every four times I go I get a number or something like max once out of every four。

 It's just not it's just not the right way to hack the system the right way to hack the system is not to go out and drop 25 grand on bottles。

 It's to have friends that are that are actually enjoy it and are excited to do it。

 It's not to hate on people who do that， Have a lot of friends who go off go out and drop 15 20。

000 on a night of bottles， I just can't do it but instead I could add value to them in other ways and then in a night。

 Though these are guys too like by the way if you're getting like tens of thousands of dollars per night。

 They won't go to the club and not do it they need to spend that kind of money in order to enjoy themselves on that given night。

 So why don't you both just enjoy what you're both trying to do on that evening right so it's not not telling you guys to go out and like play the value card。

 What I'm telling you to do is use the value card to your advantage because understand that。

 Being very high energy in Vegas and being borderline obnoxious borderline degenerate so the guys who crush it and fuck more girls than I've ever。

 I don't know that I could even imagine guys who fuck way more girls than me are doing pure degenerate game。

 They'll just stay up till 4 in the afternoon and fuck all these girls who are getting off of work at Dres。

 They're done partying at 2 in the afternoon 1 in the afternoon and they're just not even like that's that crazy light。

 It's just that's what their schedule is because once they go off work at Omni at Hawke's on they go to Dres after hours to go party。

 They go to Ryan Ogist and Chicken Fingers and then they're all looking to go fuck。

 So some guys that crush it that I know just do pure degenerate or obnoxious guy game。

 Right now I don't have the energy to like sustain that anymore and do that regularly。

 But my buddy like he fucks so many girls he's his primary works here as a cocktail actress。

 And it's just pure like high energy obnoxious guy all of his text game is just memes really funny memes。

 His in-person game is just crazy energy crazy obnoxious level。

 So we're the actual things so far table neighbor fuck and amazing opener。

 Make sure you have this guy's mentality of the ball of service thing。

 With you with the boredom thing focus on getting them talking as much as possible and reframing what's exciting to you。

 Right when I mean that is exciting to you is the get as much persuasion and convincing ability out of the girl。

 Right get it so get all this investment from the girl and use that to excite you。

 To keep her not bored every time you see her kind of like turn her face turn her body break or port immediately disqualify。

 The second I ever see a girl give like a smidge of disinterest and he sort of IOD indicator of disinterest。

 I merely say exactly and that's why and then she sucks her back and I say some funny shit。

 So if like she kind of like turns her head like this and like exactly that's why and I usually say some of the long lines of like。

 We would never work out or see that's why my mom doesn't like you and she likes everyone。

 Right immediately this laugh her ass off because of the song and the whole thing right。

 Does that make sense？ And to me that's fun to say shit like that but it's still a disqualifier。

 Right that's why see that's why exactly only fuck you is half past five。

 Right the weekend that's the song from the weekend。

 So I mean that's a really good framework by the way like immediately hit it with an aggressive pattern。

 Up to an aggressive breaking rapport and then she looks at you and gets almost like confused。

 You're like all you being the ball to yourself throwing yourself to assist right。

 It's like throwing the ball backwards and dunking it yourself。

 So like in certain cities I would then Vegas， New York， Miami， LA。

 Cities that like I would never really be in unless I'm teaching a bootcamp or something。

 They often to do the wristband like in Seattle right Seattle's a big wristband city。

 College bar areas are big wristband cities but those are all places where the girls are going to be less attractive anyway。

 So I really went find myself there very often unless I'm trying to do some sort of like business thing or something。

 Like if I'm going there for the any place that would have the wristband situation。

 I'm probably going to that place because of some guy not because of some girl， Does that make sense？

 I'm going to their network with some guy or have drinks with some friend or business connector or something。

 The places that have really attractive girls will never have the wristbands。

 Right and Vegas will the place that have wristbands， Is coy is the open？ Yeah coy。

 I'm going to shut down for a while because the wristbands。

 coy is the crazy like a limited alcohol thing if you have a wristband。

 And a couple girls got like alcohol poisoning in like one month。

 This was years ago and this is like before a shot I'll even open。

 This is like when pure was like first starting out and these crazy。

 The wristband thing is not for the high value area right？， Does that answer your question enough？

 Yeah cool， What about a marquee day club？ Okay so the day clubs do have the wristbands sometimes right？

， So that's a little bit different so what about marquee day club specifically？。

 I was just saying they've been in this last time you know。

 Yeah was it just to enter or was it for the IP area？ Just to enter， Yeah， Yeah。

 Yeah here's the thing kind of like here like there's two new guys that were working here。

 So like my desk for like my office is connected here。

 Like our Vegas immersion like our Vegas immersion team has a better office setup than all of our Z combined。

 And it's completely free just because of networking with the staff here。

 But even with that happening the staff here tried to like wander me in like ID me as I was walking。

 And I walked past him and as I walked past him， I didn't really have time use them very very nice but I didn't have time for it because I was。

 I wanted to get to you guys or whatever so I was like no I don't have time for this and I just walked where I passed them。

 I was like I'm and he was like wait but what but what and I just kept walking and then he just didn't say anything。

 And it was funny to me because I was like wait he doesn't know me he's a new guy。

 It's a little root of me to not like acknowledge that that he's new。

 And I mean I'm walking I mean I'm more like it sandals and like a tear away shirt。

 Like it's he wasn't that rude or crazy right to think that like he should want you know。

 I mean that wasn't that obnoxious of him but I just didn't have the time to deal with this like authority kind of thing。

 So I just blew past it that's kind of how I act at marquee dayclub with the wristband thing。

 Some of you might be ready to kind of take on that kind of level here's thing。

 The whole like you're good enough or what's the what's the e word and title meant that fucking word right。

 Like at least half of you shouldn't be entitled you to at least part some of you don't deserve this kind of thing。

 Right the VIP treatment right unless you have some sort of context and reason to to get the entitlement or to have that VIP treatment。

 Do you see the difference there fake entitlement is worse than no entitlement。

 Okay but if you just meet a couple people and then from marquee dayclub for example you meet this。

 Right you meet this marquee you'll never need the wristband ever they'll just give you a heart。

 They'll be like oh this fucker yeah he never wears this goddamn wristband but keep trying to get him to wear it。

 And then you're just like yeah and you like flick off the guy who's supposed to wristband you and then walk past him。

 And when you have that kind of relationship with him then you don't even need the wristbands。

 And instead the fact that you don't have the regular I regularly go to hawkasson and excess and sweatpants。

 Sweeppants and sandals are like sweatpants and and just like really comfortable shoes sweatpants usually like Kobe's or Jordans or something and then just like the most comfy sweatpants I could wear。

 Right and then this is like crazy fashion apart then I wear like a button up though it looks retarded it looks ridiculous。

 But the fact that I'm willing to the fact that like I'm able to be that guy in that setting。

 If it does two things one is it gives me such high value because when girls see that and they're like wait how do you。

 The point with the like the wristband thing and all that other stuff right just you make a few connections by doing some of stuff I've already。

 Scribed to you and obviously a lot more like you could do the same investment game with guys as well。

 That's how I mean get obviously like there's this little bit of this gap that has to be bridged between you know just。

 Meet these people you know just like walking in and using your real cloudy again the night clubs。

 And then being able to wear sweatpants to get into the clubs and whatnot right because this bridge has to be gapped。

 Part of that gap is mere exposure right the more mere exposure is the more times you expose yourself to somebody more trust and attraction。

 That you build up over time so by doing the like the the table number thing and doing the table drill over over。

 Over again I keep ingrained in their minds that I'm that guy that I'm the HNIC right that Nigan charge some clubs and some。

 Areas will stamp you I intentionally don't take the stamp because I want to do strategy he just said。

 I don't want to be the guy getting the stamp either he that's that gets the point of trying to make two guys is I'm not my goal is to not to teach。

 You how to be the guy that the wall they want to give the wristband to my goal is to teach you to be the guy that。

 Isn't fucking matter who gives a shit right I want to I want to be the guy that like now I know the owners like。

 I don't want to be the guy that knows the owner I want to be the guy the owner knows me so well that like the texts are。

 Happening where then I get pushed to the owners table every night club as an owner's table right next to us is。

 Right when you walk you walk up the stairs walk down the stairs right to the right it's either for like huge。

 Huge spenders or you know or it's wins table his own table。

 He's working there hawk is on his their own table every club is the owner's table like I want to be led directly to that table。

 Where there's a thing called the NFU list you guys want NFU list on what that means with stands for。

 It's called the no fuck up list。 It's an actual list at night clubs that means that if you're on that list。

 They can't fuck up and they have to let you in by any means necessary and rush you to the front of the line and what not。

 Right if you don't even know that these things exist you never you ever trying to attain that level of status。

 But you can attain that level of status I almost don't even I almost don't call it social circle game because。

 Every time I talk about stuff like this everyone's like yeah you're the social circle guy that's why you talk about stuff like that。

 Like no like even when I called approach I'm still thinking of energy of these things。

 I'm just trying to code approach in a much better environment and stack the odds in my favor。

 I want to rig the game so that I get hotter girls than the next guy well often right。

 So in a situation like this exactly you just described is what I do in order to have them come back in。

 I make it such an idea that in night clubs too I'll get to the night club by any means necessary。

 And then when I'm leaving I'm the slowest guy ever to walk in or out of night clubs。

 I'm so slow I take so I will sometimes take 10-15 minutes to walk into a night club。

 After I've already got okay and this is the funniest part after I've already gotten ahead of the line in my id check。

 I get surrender I'll take 15 minutes some time to walk between from that first rope into that right side door in this render。

 Because I'm saying hi to everybody I want them to all see this this stupid face as much as possible as long as possible。

 Before and then like I'm like walking backwards I'm for I'm seeing someone else that I forgot to see。

 Oh hey what up Jay Sean hey what up Julian hey I'm just like saying hi to everybody and it's the same it kind of feels stupid and weird to do that every Wednesday。

 And then I'm like hey what's up hey what but like it's like wait this Sabin that's what that's what people do who don't need the respect。

 They they are still doing that it feels weird to me because it just seems kind of incompetent。

 It just seems weird just like say hello to the sit to do that same like night club high five cordial thing。

 The night high five with the pad on the back I just saw you yesterday and the day before I'm gonna see you tomorrow。

 Why do we need to do this huge like you you again what's up fucker how's it going but like every night we see that seven nights a week。

 There's certain guys that I have that like surprise like crazy see you again。

 But it's just it's just it's just works so well so why fight it right it's like it's kind of the opposite of like big being polarizing。

 Right like that that aggressive sexual escalation polarizing see a girl and reach out and grab her talk about shit that interests you。

 All of that type of game can be lumped up into game that works really well on college campus drunken bar situations。

 Right you want to do heavy keynote do the heavy keynote and in a drunken bar Austin six street kind of context。

 You want to fuck really hot tropic beauty girls playboy playmates maximum models。

 You do hands-off game don't talk about what interests you just talk be very assuming of the value。

 Remember the opener that I gave you guys to the really hot real opener and be a real one of us。

 So yeah and the show is very important so who do you know here right it's almost kind of being like why the fuck are you here like so it's I'm it there's like a certain。

 Like undertone to it that's like like me wondering if she really belongs or if I need to go grab somebody to kick her out。

 So who do you know here but I'll say that as an opener and I won't know anybody that's why it's funny。

 I look at her and I'll be like oh so who do you know who do you know who do you know here and she'll be like oh I know Jack。

 Jack and Sam Sam Rima he's the playboy casting director I know him because of this reason and this reason and usually I'm like well well I get it all right I won't ask you to leave then。

 Because like she's just going to dump all his investment onto you that's to answer your question earlier that to me is very exciting。

 And the rest of the fact that I don't really belong there combined with what I'm saying to me that I'm like a picking shit I think that's awesome。

 That's so cool for me to have that type of interaction does that make sense I love doing like crazy shit in the middle of Cosmo casino and then get in and like getting told that I need to go to talent club。

 Because like they want to like like one time this happened where they had to they reviewed I was a nobody Jack he's a big gambler Cosmo。

 And they they actually reviewed the security takes with us because we were like they're like yo when you guys so broke you guys I think this is really funny。

 Because we're just acting drunken stupid in Cosmo they brought us into the talent club which is like a really high limit area of Cosmo。

 And then they like they literally had to talk with us about how they're gonna have to show us security tapes and then two days later they showed it to us。

 Because it was just so obnoxious you should never go into game at at at night thinking every set is either either fucker or I don't and I got blown like I've been blown out in years。

 Because there's no blowout either I'm choosing to hit on this hotter girl or I'm going to choose to stay with this girl and get a number or fuck。

 There is no like hit on 30 girls in the night 15 kind of went okay 15 blowout like that whole idea of like that polarizing either the set goes really well or poorly。

 Is just that's terrible social skills that's terrible game huh yeah at a certain point you have to have this blow me a blow me out kind of mentality。

 After you've been with the girl for two three four hours right then yeah blow me a blow me out right make the host say no kind of thing。

 But before that like when you're when I'm at walk in that table and I say oh so who you you know so who do you know here whatever so who would you come here with her or whatever it is。

 I've already done the whole table drill with the bouncer the bouncer is already remember how I said that when the bouncer is over I'm already high five in some dude as soon as I get there right so I'm already having three to five names to work with。

 And then when she's like oh so I'll be like yeah no jack and she'd like oh you know jack and then I'll look at jack and be like。

 And then y'all said and jack because I just high five him look at me and go right he'll like do the dismissive jerk off motion to me or flip me off and then immediately she goes oh okay but I've known him for three seconds five seconds of an interaction。

 But I'm just I just have the balls to act like that and then immediately sets the frame of mind and。

 Like I'm just like three those are three four bottle bars and all right who are like who like that interaction back and forth who they like people giving them shit kind of。

 And then immediately she sees that and then it always forgiven all is good right and then I just play them off of each other for the whole matter for the next several months of knowing them and then eventually now they're like the facade just becomes real。

 Because then eventually we had these cool stories with each other and it's like hey when do we first meet each other and then it's crazy a weird time distortion they'll have。

 It's crazy I'm these people that I've met the past six months or a year and a half and they're like man we've known each other a long time like three four or five years right。

 And I'm like I'm like eight months ago like I won't say that to them but like when you have those kind of interactions were right off the bat you're like flicking each other off you're like like I'll walk up to you like who spends like 50 grand 75 grand at night and I'll like start smacking them on the ass。

 Well I'll go down and throw his head into a nougie and I'll start giving him a nougie and then he'll just be like oh Luke this fucker。

 And everyone's like holy shit he just gave no。G。 what the fuck and then they see that and then like jackal like pitch my fucking nipples and they're like oh this fucking guy。

 And then we're just so crazy with each other the people think we're like old college buddies or something cool so the key is it's kind of like when you tease a girl and she doesn't just doesn't respond。

 Right that's kind of a similar thing you went for a risk you went you went for that risk to try to get some good results to come out of it and it just didn't hit or something didn't quite happen。

 Do you retreat and kind of like get called out right you're just like oh fuck all right hey you got me or do you just。

 Just pull it fucking forward and say a more class joke or go around it a little bit and say something even more obnoxious or just keep driving the train forward。

 Right any time I'm trying to gain tactic like that I never admit defeat I just go harder with it more aggressive。

 So if a if a if a bouncer actually leads me to usually the bouncer doesn't lead you to table unless you pressure it usually you're just like oh table 42 and usually when I'm saying the table number I actually I actually see a group of girls or a cool guy that's acting very friendly or I'll see some desired area first。

 And then I'll say that I'm at that table that's how that sheet is so important because I'll quickly look up on the sheet takes two seconds like it's very apparent what table number it is。

 And by this at this point I know kind of where all the tables are that I want access to and I'll grab the nearest bouncer and say hey I'm at table 47 I think it's in that area。

 Could you help me out a little bit bro and immediately he's like yeah I got you 47 it is over there but or no it's actually over here and then it's correct me and then we'll all go to that area does that make sense。

 So it usually doesn't happen but if it does happen where he leads you a table it's empty I'll immediately look at him and be like I thought you said this was table 47。

 And then he like I'll say in this like what the fuck and then immediately he's and immediately he immediately goes straight back to me and goes this is table 47。

 And I go I don't need to be rude but I don't see my friends do you see my friends I don't I don't see them and then I don't be rude or like obnoxious here but I don't see them。

 And he goes no I don't see your friends and I go so you see my problem and then he and then he at that point half the time。

 He'll just get annoyed and walk away which okay I'm now it and at that point like I've already achieved what my goal is does that make sense。

 Like I'll just sit there you know I'll be like all right fine can you just grab the waitress then that that used to for about a year and a half。

 That was my whole thing is I would get I would sit at bottle service tables with no bottle but I would just use the waitress to bring me drinks。

 And I would pay for the drinks or whatever like you know I would not be like what two drinks or three drinks tonight or something。

 And I would just use the because I as a P。R。I。 do you really give a fuck about the table and anyway the point is you can I can almost always negotiate that。

 Or I can just sit at the table and no one's there and then I just order drinks like one drink at a time from the waitress table drill。

 Who does not know the table drill is but they've but you have heard me mention it last time。

 Who does not know the table drill is cool have you done it yet how to work it worked pretty good in like the beginning but then I kind of just like because I know I have to like bring the party to the table。

 No no stop stop I mean at that point I don't even give a shit did did did it work for the first 20 seconds how well I got it。

 There you go right it's kind of like saying an opener worked if I ask you hey did that if I give you an opener and I say hey did that work。

 I don't give a shit if you didn't fuck the girl off the open right all like you know you get what I'm saying the table drill if I give that to you and it works。

 Meaning did they accept you into the table and did they you know get that did it by you 30 seconds then that's a really good success。

 Right the cool thing about the table drill is it will work I mean I hate throw these percentages out because then sometimes like guys will try to prove it wrong but like it works for me 100% of time。

 I think it worked for you guys 80% to 100% table drill as you go up to tables you get you infiltrate their table and you associate yourself with their group。

 And you stay with that group instead of going to the table or the bar area or the dance floor area。

 Okay and you guys have a idea on how you could do that there you go bring bring value to the table right have two girls with you。

 What's the only problem with that and see like Vegas or Miami there's guys who are paid by the club to just throw them girls。

 Right and that actually will sometimes they just make them feel insecure because I've tried this whole deal where like oh you bring girls to the club and you try to get into the club with girls or you try to throw girls at the table。

 Exactly that's what happens sometimes right so instead what can you do what's the one thing that I want to see you guys can come up with the answer。

 What's the one thing that you could do if the girls or if the guy at that table and the girls that are there they have everything you could possibly need。

 How could you infiltrate that table by showing them that you don't need anything Larry we think。

 To this day one of my favorite openers one of my I did a 90 day program in Australia with a guy a private coaching for 90 straight days。

 He lives in Chicago he came up with one of my favorite openers I ever have heard he's got a drink it's full he goes up to a girl and he goes。

 Can you buy me a drink it's a full drink right why is that funny it says rich is like a couple hundred million dollars he's 29 30 years old。

 Do you think he needs a girl to buy me drink yes or no no does she know that he's rich no right if she does know then I'd be nervous because she's looking at his shoes or his watch and that I'd be a little nervous。

 How does he convey that he doesn't want anything from the girl by having to full drink in his hand you understand why is that magical why is that beautiful。

 Because of twelve dollar drink an eight to twenty dollar drink right that conveys the maximum amount of value you could possibly have。

 You go up to a bottle service area with a drink in your hand I will grab drinks all fucking tables and sometimes for fun I'll try to see how close I just to fuck with the shit I'll see how close can I grab a full bottle。

 From like the distance between the table I'm trying to infiltrate and how close it can be because very easy to go off over here and like grab a half empty bottle of like a dude's the kind of left right。

 But it's fucking risky a shit to try to hit on girls at that table and grab a bottle of vodka at this table and just grab it and then go over here right but how how arrogant do you need to be and how much of a non-value seeker do you need to be if you're carrying a bottle of vodka going up to a group of guys being like hey what's up。

 Like they don't know to do with you they don't do you think they think that you're trying to steal from them or take from them。

 Not at all this is how social circle game can work where you can do this in 30 minutes an hour whereas if you try to do just pure direct game or presence game what are you going to do you go up to the girl and do what。

 Hand of God hey what what are you gonna say can you line huh。

 Let's see how who are you what's your story right get your little ass over here right that shit's money on the street right you're walking up it on the street like there's nobody in the world who's as good as street game is。

 Oh in this like it's literally hey where is he I want to be kid on him every time you just street game right he's amazing at it but if you're in a nightclub you kind of can't really do that street game kind of approach。

 Because it's everyone's stationary you don't really have bottles service people moving from table table right so it's a bit more zero sum right it's a zero sum game。

 Okay so you go up to it you have to make it very very clear that you don't want anything from that table once you make it clear you don't want anything from them guess what's going to happen。

 It's crazy what they'll do they will like do you do the table drill like you do it well enough the one line will get you to fuck a girl it's wild right you do the table drill well enough。

 I mean I granted when I do the table drill I'm an obnoxious I mean it just imagine like the little bit that you guys know about me imagine how I do the table drill。

 I'm taking off my belt grabbing a bottle of vodka the bouncers like what are you doing I go go fuck yourself and then I start pouring it on the guy who just bought this table and I hope that he tilts his head back。

 Like no like that's what's happening because guess what guess what happens to me regardless of what occurs the girls laugh their ass off。

 Worst case scenario the guys like go fuck yourself and he pushes me I'm like haha。

 But like that's the best way to like bro out with a new just bought a table right to show that that kind of balls I granted it takes a little bit of。

 Grigarius nest I guess is a nice word for it to be able to do that but you do that they're gonna fucking love you and all those girls are like who the fuck is that guy。

 Right I'm again I'm doing the now that we're getting like kind of wanting to the end of the seminar I'm giving you guys like what I do and I'm trying to get you guys at least do like five six or seven on that ten point scale。

 Right that's why I said go up to the bottle service table with a full drink in your hand that's what you guys should be realistically doing。

 When I do it I will grab a bottle of vodka off of somebody else's table right when the convenient moment and I'll bring it up to another table and say hey what's up table neighbor when I say what's up table neighbor what does that imply。

 Correct and if they don't quite get that what's in my hand a bottle so I'm making it extremely clear that I don't need what。

 Anything from them at all right okay and by me going up to the guy what does that imply when he's got a bunch of girls around him that I don't want to fuck his girls but guess what I want to do I want to fuck all of them。

 I'm going to even it takes me months I'm going to we my way into his life right okay so what I do it all starts with me grabbing a fucking sometimes an empty bottle of goose off some retarded fucking table I'll grab it go like this and guess what I mean again be very careful doing this but maybe 25% of time a bounce was like what are you doing I go who the fuck are you and I go over here you say it like that guess what happens。

 He's like I'm I don't know and he goes over here right it's kind of funny I mean me saying it I'm like what the fuck is wrong with me right but then guess you turned up a notch right where you want to energy to go all the way up okay so then you okay you want to do like exactly what I would do。
