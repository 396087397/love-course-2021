 other guys are very naturally good at making girls comfortable， but not very good at the value。

 so they'll think game is all value， because that was their learning progression。

 right now if you're a guy that's you know good at value。

 but bad at comfort and you're taking lessons from a guy who's good at comfort， and bad at value。

 all his lessons are going to be the exact opposite of what you need。

 but if you can look at what he's doing， and like contextualize it and ask yourself why。

 now you can still learn very very effectively from that person。

 yeah i mean these little nuances too， it's like i really think like that's like one of the biggest like blockages。

 two in terms of learning games it's like guys are like well it's my looks。

 you know it's my money in most cases like， and it sounds kind of harsh saying it's like your own stupidity。

 that gets in your way more so than anything else， like a lot of these questions i'm like。

 it's like such black and white thinking， and if you can just see passing in like black and white and start thinking。

 hmm maybe i can resolve this paradox if i think a little further。

 and if i see the nuances so a few examples like one is the open。

 okay and yeah i mean the opener doesn't matter if you think about it like。

 from a like guys who stress out it's like oh my god what do i say oh my god。

 i'm like freaking out um hearing something like hey the opener doesn't。

 matter it's like oh kind of gives you permission to jump in。

 but then obviously on the flip side here's the nuance。

 um if you go up and you're like hey and it's just like the girl doesn't hear you。

 uh where it's like very leechy like what's up， you know i had a client this weekend like on the first night that was his。

 open he's like what's up and they just stand there and the girl's like。

 like he doesn't know how to convey his vibe he doesn't know how to convey his。

 personality um on the flip side of that too you'll have the guy's like。

 yeah he makes himself like feel good he goes up and it's just like too much for。

 the girl you know if you can't connect that with the girl if you can't show her。

 like hey i'm a cool guy she's not going to talk to you。

 so if you think of it from that perspective it's like。

 both can be right but again it's like there's a lot more to it there's the。

 context some other examples would be um you know you hear me say。

 game every girl it's like talk you know learn to game girls you don't find。

 attractive um that's who you get the hot girls， now here's another one it's like you understand that。

 but then you can also fall into this trap of only gaming girls who want to。

 attract because they're too scared to now approach the hot ones。

 so now the advice comes you gotta talk to the fucking hot girls you walk out。

 in the hottest girl there you open her so it depends on the situation。

 you know another one is um you got uh you know kick yourself in the。

 fucking ass it's like if you go out and you cycle off you got to beat。

 yourself up a bit so you are motivated to take more action the next day。

 you know you also have self acceptance but yeah but then if you do it too far。

 you be yourself to the point you're not taking action so then it's like hey。

 don't be yourself up that'll motivate you to take more action and。

 guys like what you be yourself up or not and it really comes down like a lot。

 of the time it's just a common sense like if you take this be yourself up。

 or not think whatever will motivate you to have more action。

 usually you can be yourself up to a point where you're taking action and then。

 it's like too much then you bring in self acceptance。

 you approving yourself you do it too much to the point where you start。

 slacking off and you know not doing anything it's just like。

 reform and rationalization then it's back to meeting yourself up okay so。

 learning how to see these nuances even in the vibe in a way。

 you know you hear like offering value taking value you guys like what。

 you're asking a question like how how is that offering value and they。

 don't see that it's the nuances where you can ask a question like what's。

 like what's your name taking or what's your name offering value in the vibe。

 another one is you know you hear Dolby Needy， like Lincoln did even say opening it's like I hear you're not supposed to be。

 Needy but you're the guy walking up to open the girl how is isn't that。

 Needy like not seen it's like it's the place it's all coming from。

 emotionally you know and like failing to see these nuances is really what。

 holds a lot of guys back getting hooked on like， or like dogmatically believing into one thing it's like oh I heard。

 it's this and it's always this like not willing to like you know just。

 let go of those like firm beliefs because that's really what's gonna block。

 you you know you know even the same with what would be we were talking about。

 here it's like you have like you hear okay you need to be like on top of。

 like these technical things you gotta start thinking logically and you know we。

 talk about this with like logistics preceding so on and so forth but at。

 the same time paradoxically have fun represent to the moment don't think。

 about the future and guys like what what's one is it you have to learn to。

 see past the black and white thinking and like play the paradoxes you know。

 and yeah I mean it's crazy how how our mind works that way like even like。

 again with clients with our videos is like well Todd you must always be logical。

 it's always this it's like no not black and white thinking yeah one great。

 example of this is buying girl drink there was this rule in the pickup。

 community a long time ago she's don't ever buy a girl a drink。

 never right then the idea was don't duplicate don't be the guy who's like。

 needy and trying to buy the girls affection instead of like just believing。

 you're enough for it innately and that's because a lot of guys come into the。

 pickup community as being way too nice at guys right where they come in。

 having this like iconography for movies where it's like what you do is you buy。

 a girl a drink to open and that sets you up completely in the provider frame。

 and sets up this situation where you're courting the girl she has value。

 etc so guys wanted to get out of that frame so this idea of never ever buy a。

 girl a drink however I'll tell you when I want to pull a girl one of the。

 absolute best things you can do is go buy a drink with her and here's why。

 it's a great excuse to isolate her from her friends number one。

 number two it establishes sort of like a context and a vibe that you。

 and she are together doing some activity which is really really good uh。

 number three although you don't you're not like trying to get her drunk。

 per se or anything like that the fact that she has had some alcohol the。

 narrative in her head is oh we're having fun we were partying it just。

 happened i wasn't responsible etc so that allows her to engage in。

 behaviors um without feeling that she's gonna like have sort of。

 consequences to herself a steam or consequences of judgment um so there's。

 three very good reasons two buy a girl a drink another really great reason to。

 buy a girl a drink is that a lot of time for meeting a girl in a bar。

 that's what people are doing there and being in that vibe is just going to。

 help you to to fit in and be more can grow and be more。

 accepted by everyone there now it's not to say that if you never drink you。

 should be pure pressured into buying a girl a drink or whatever。

 but i am saying there are valid reasons for it in a lot of context。

 to just say that it's never a good idea is very very silly right also。

 obviously to say it's always a good idea would make you very poor very very。

 quickly right so it's not an always or never， it's a bit of a gray area just just add on that rfs too there's。

 i like it blows my mind when i hear stories too of like guys who could pull a。

 girl but because they refuse to go for that， right the girls like yeah we just have a drink with me and then。

 they're like no i refuse yes like no it's like just have the。

 death drink yeah yeah for sure um like so stubborn like stuck to these rules。

 they like you'll fall you're not aware of like the particular situation。

 that you just fuck up the pool um but i like that too it's like it's really。

 that same concept where you hear like the drink it's like see the underlying。

 principle because even with the negs it's like um a neg or a false time。

 constraint that's another one so the neg basically back in the day the place。

 was coming from is i need to bring the girl down， if you think of it differently here's another context it's。

 playfully challenging the girl if it's coming from a different place。

 totally it's go for it the same with false time constraints like guys in the。

 back in the day would open a girl like hey i just have uh just two。

 set you know two minutes because my friends are coming we're have to go in two。

 minutes and the reason was the assumption is i'm， such a piece of shit you only have to tolerate me two minutes。

 but if you use it in a more practical way where say she has a concern like oh。

 fuck you know my friends coming like wait how long is this guy what what's。

 going on you'd like use it practically to address that concern。

 now her mind's like free so she can actually listen to you and you can。

 convey your personality totally fucking awesome， if the friends are coming in you're like you tell the friends like oh no just。

 two minutes we'll be right there or we'll be back in two minutes。

 totally fucking awesome so it's really the subtleties the nuances the place。

 it's all coming from you know no matter what it is like there's never。

 anything where it's always this or always that so you might ask yourself how。

 do i handle these paradoxes right like what on okay that's great that i。

 understand these things exist now what the fuck can i do about i'm just still。

 confused um so here are a couple things that that i will say as principle is。

 number one be willing to experiment like i look at game as um it's obviously。

 about getting sex and whatnot but i also look at it as like science i look at it。

 as the search for truth and in science there's this thing called the scientific。

 method right so what you do in scientific method is you have hypothesis you。

 have an idea of how the world works you test it you see what what comes out of。

 that test and then from there you either validate that hypothesis or you。

 need to change that hypothesis okay so if you don't know what to do in a。

 particular context what you should you do draw on your experience and body。

 of knowledge and just do the best you can in that moment and just trust you。

 know what the best you can is let by definition the best you can okay you're。

 not going to beat it just do it and be okay with it and accept whatever the。

 result is but then be analytical about the result if you do it and it goes well。

 that's what you're going to do again and again and also ask yourself why。

 right so if you do it it goes well i had this hypothesis it worked okay good。

 that solidifies the hypothesis and also even deepens the why if you do it and it。

 doesn't work well you should you're going to probably lose this at or you're。

 going to at least this that's going to get a little less good for a second。

 then you can probably recover it if you're actually talented or actually。

 experienced a game um but then you can ask yourself later on don't think too。

 much in the field ask yourself later on why did that happen that that。

 challenges my notion of game and this is an opportunity for you to learn。

 and this is an opportunity for you to enrich and deepen your model。

 and then the idea is because a lot of people with the question i get a lot。

 with the technical game is how do you think about all those things in field。

 and the fact of the matter is i don't i don't think in field but i think a。

 lot out of the field and because i have a very rich model in my head。

 and that model is something i believe deeply and have internalized。

 the right behaviors just come out as an outgrowth of that model right and it's。

 not like i have to think about it it's like if um as an athlete right um if。

 if you're learning how to like catch a baseball you aren't thinking about all。

 the physics of catching the baseball you aren't thinking about like the wind。

 velocity this and that and the other you're just you know your brain your subconscious。

 brain is reacting to all the similar times that there was there was a baseball。

 hit with a similar trajectory and your your feet are running to the right。

 place your hands going up in the right way， and you're just trusting your muscle memory right um and that's what you're。

 really doing in game you do all the thinking to enhance your muscle。

 memory enhance your understanding internalize more and more concepts。

 but then when you actually go out you trust your muscle memory and do the best。

 you can and most of the time your muscle memory is going to serve you very well。

 and then the occasional time that it doesn't that's when you go back to the。

 drawing board break density that was very interesting why didn't that work。

 right and if occasionally like occasionally it's just the girl with psycho。

 right but if you're you have a pattern of this thing is not working over and over again。

 then it's you right if it's not working five six seven times in a row like。

 wait that's something i'm doing wrong let me try this let me try this let me try。

 this you find the solution and because you figured out that solution logically。

 and methodically you have that solution forever once you've corrected that。

 sticking point should never ever ever have it again and that's the great。

 thing about doing things in a technical scientific way but that said。

 you're not thinking all the time in field you're not doing like fucking。

 calculus in front of the girl yeah and with that too when you're breaking it。

 down like thinking technically outside of the field it's not just looking at。

 the surface or the interaction it's really looking at every little。

 fucking variable like what was i feeling what was she feeling in the。

 moment when i said this what was the place it was coming from what time of the。

 night was it what was her situation was she with her friends was it in a bar。

 was it in a club what type of girl is it is it a girl that responds a little。

 bit more to dickish behavior to nicest behavior to more extreme to more。

 chill it's like all these little fucking variables like that's we need to。

 hone in on and then obviously with time analyzing every single。

 fucking reference like really maximizing the value from those references。

 then it just you you develop that field just part of who you are and it just。

 fucking handled you know it's not just being like well i said this and it。

 didn't work i said this and it worked it's like you got to look in depth at。

 every fucking detail it's very rarely just the words it's very rarely。

 just it's the whole package yeah absolutely but you have to have that。

 mindset like if you're not breaking it down you know outside of the field it's。

 like you're not going to progress and actually another one to just kind of。

 linking it to these paradoxes is it's that old like kind of intent freedom。

 from outcome like plain to win but the same time like not caring like i'll。

 hear guys like oh freedom from outcome and they're just。

 fuck it like not aiming to even get the girl it's like no for that person。

 there it's you better fucking like be attached to the damn outcome and go。

 for the girl but then at the same time it can be coming from that place of。

 i need her to be complete so it's a difference between plain to win where it's。

 your intention to get the girl versus i need her to complete myself you know it's。

 like all these little fucking subtleties there or um self amusement you know。

 it's like uh guy the guys will go up to girls and like do crazy things to。

 girls like runs off and they're like yeah self amusement it's like no。

 you're still in an interaction where self amusement has to involve the girl。

 and it has to lead towards sex okay so whatever right now um you know you。

 think is like oh paradoxical contradictory the challenge would be and。

 what i'm telling you to do with this video here is try to see the context。

 try to see how both are correct in a certain context and try to see past that。

 black and white uh thinking you know and if you do that like your game will。

 explode and it also affect again like the way you break it down。

 and that's huge you know you can't just be like fucking black and white to be。

 willing to to challenge every belief you have like right now if you have。

 like firm beliefs ask yourself is there evidence of the contrary。

 you know and don't try to this is another big one it's like don't try to um。

 like how to say it like crystallize game you know it's like i'll have。

 clients sometimes like that be like well i'm looking for like the grand。

 theory of game and uh it's there is no like grand theory what all comes。

 together it's like all these different models the kind of co-exist and。

 they just kind of pull up a different uh different situations。

 yeah um so one other thing that i get asked a lot with a technical game is。

 i think when people get technical they get a little perfectionist right and i。

 just want to tell you there's no such thing as perfect game i've never run a。

 perfect set and you will never run a perfect set， but here's the good news you don't have to you don't have to run anything。

 remotely resembling a perfect set you can have flaws and mistakes all over。

 the place and still get the result as long as you're doing enough things。

 right to overwhelm those flaws and mistakes all right so it's not about being。

 perfect and with any trait in game i always kind of look at it as a range。

 right and so there's like um there's like being nice versus being an asshole。

 right so if you're too nice you get walked all over the girl and respect you。

 if you're too much of an asshole the girl can't relate to you she doesn't like。

 see herself as special in any way and she'll just reject you for her own like。

 sort of safety and self-esteem right but then there's wide range between too。

 nice and too much of an asshole and you can really be anywhere in that。

 range and you're fine so the ranges on these things are quite wide and actually。

 that's a lot why you see the different styles right so you might see one。

 person in like the more asshole part of the range。

 you might see someone else and like the more you know sweet nice innocent。

 amazing guy part of the skidding um you might see us in different parts of。

 the range but the point is we're both easily within the range right if either。

 one of us went too nice guy or too asshole it wouldn't work。

 and the same thing occurs in terms of um i don't know um how engaged we are。

 and attentive to the girl either as a two into the girl we're super needy if。

 either of us are like too like a luf that the girl doesn't think she has a。

 chance then like the girl who's interest or she'll just give up or think she。

 can't have us and so we may fall within different places on that spectrum。

 but we're both within the effective range and that's what we'll see for。

 everybody with their styles of game is they're in that effective range。

 and what you'll see in your own game is that your blowouts will come when。

 you're we're falling away from the effective range and the nice thing is when。

 you make those corrections you don't have to correct to perfect who's。

 have to correct to some place generally within the range so that's the nice。

 thing is you don't you don't have to be perfect but you do have to keep。

 making the proper adjustments yeah and it also kind of gives you that。

 flexibility and freedom too where it's like because if it is perfect it's。

 really like oh my god every single time it's like just aim for that range find。

 the range test it you know in that too it's like a lot of this is really。

 emotional where what's the right answer like how do you know where like the。

 tipping point is trial and error you know it's really like you got to。

 develop a feel for every little part of this like every little fucking。

 subtlety it comes from experience it's like learning balance。

 because like well how far do I lean over to the right before I fall over it's。

 like try you know and yeah don't let anything block you too it's like。

 challenge every little bit of advice like like that another one I'm just。

 throwing a bunch here just to really give you thing in this way um is for。

 example I talk about like the tempo of the night where it's very rare in the。

 first part of the night you know you're gonna pull a girl so I'm like in the。

 first part of the night get phone numbers get logistics collect leads and then。

 some guy will fall on a girl who's buying temperatures high who's ready and he's。

 like no it's too early it's a number it's like no it's like every rule of the。

 game be willing to break it you know it's like the the rules all these ideas as。

 you said it's like guidelines they're all guides exactly they're guidelines。

 they're not stuff you have to achieve you know it's just to give you certain。

 direction yeah it's like don't let this become who you are make those。

 guidelines kind of work for you um and again with that the the time of the。

 night thing it's understand the why of the model why is the time of the night。

 thing that you won't likely pull into the night well it's a buying temperature。

 or it's the the context that the girls viewing it through but if you meet a。

 girl at 10 o'clock at night who's been drinking and parting since 2 p。m。 for her， it's 4 a。m。

 you know meaning in her world she's in 4 a。m。 mode even if the， club's in 10 p。m。

 mode right so ask yourself why or even depending on the。

 girl it's like some girls they're just down immediately you know not the。

 majority but you will find some like that so yeah understand like the。

 underlying principles and apply it you can pull out the tools that you'll。

 need in the moment you know sometimes like you'll need this one sometimes。

 that one will be like the dumbest thing you could do so they're all these。

 fucking variables practice tried out the last thing it's say to kind of wrap。

 this is you know one thing I reinforce in 10 game is it's really about like。

 these awesome experiences like these stories you kind of look back in your。

 journey like holy fuck I'd say for you like if you kind of look back either。

 recently overall it's like one of those just epic experiences out。

 the really stands out where you're like fuck yeah like that's why I'm in the。

 game if you could just kind of share it I don't for me the best ones are when。

 like skill set meets opportunity like I've been with like tons of hot girls that。

 those are always amazing how great relationship those are always amazing。

 but I really like it when you learn something new and then you go use it like。

 right away or or maybe you come up against a challenge that you haven't had。

 before and and you're able to overcome it so one of my favorites all time。

 it was actually a while ago in in Vegas and it was a situation where。

 I'll just give you like kind of the brief version but essentially I wasn't。

 even planning on starting my night yet and I ended up picking up this girl。

 just as a like half a wing me to get into the club and she started giving me。

 some shit about it and what was good about this set was it was an accidental。

 open in a way and so from the very first moment of the interaction I was the。

 most high value could possibly as I'm gonna run forget it I'll find someone。

 else who's like what what no and start chasing me right so we ended up。

 bringing her into this club and basically walked her walk she down the。

 stairs and that was that was it and I was like like cool I'm gonna go enjoy。

 the club just like what you're leaving might well I guess we could have a。

 drink or something so I'm sure whatever so we did that and then my friends。

 were going to another club bounced her to another club and they happened。

 to have a connection so we walked her through that。

 which walked her straight into the club ahead of the line and it was really。

 great because this is one of the the earliest times that I had that kind of。

 access it was great seeing what her reaction to being truly truly super high。

 value was and so I ended up taking her home actually pretty quick I think the。

 whole set was maybe an hour even including the the club to club venue。

 change to get her home and pull and then when I did get her back I was just。

 like kind of slow playing because I like to I like to take my time when I get。

 the girl back I like to have the girls seduce me and this girl was like。

 beckoning to bed like do you want to come here please like will you please。

 and like actually begging and this is great because a it was like a pure。

 value pull which for me is a big thing because my when when I was first。

 learning game I was always like too nice not enough value and so it was a very。

 polarizing like this is exactly what value and no comfort does it when done。

 properly so it was really good not that that context but it was also at the。

 same time one of the hottest girls I'd ever been with so it was just this。

 nice little like culmination of like I did this thing that was my vision for。

 what what game should look like it worked really well and the girls really。

 hot and she ended up being like kind of an amazing girl as well so that was。

 a just pretty epic because it just brought it all together right it's not。

 just that it was a hot girl it's not just that I did something but it was just。

 like the overall experience just it it it's like why you're in the game right。

 it's like what's the difference between like like sex to me it's great but。

 it's greater if it has meaning and that had meaning for me because it was。

 an and it's emblematic of my growth to that moment so yeah see past the。

 paradoxes look at the nuanced think played smarts make game work for you。

 and yeah man any last words um yeah just think right think for yourself don't。

 think in field in field just take action but do not take anything just at face。

 value if I say something and it goes against your experience or if julien says。

 something it goes against your experience trust your experience first。

 more than you trust our stuff however take us as authorities and try some。

 of the stuff and see if you get a new experience from it but end of the day。

 you are the side of your own life you're the person who has to think for yourself。

 first and foremost so never um relinquish that responsibly to anybody else。

 and never think completely black and white。
