 And while gaming at EDC together， But did I tell you about that yet？， No this was huge。

 Yes I got unlimited tickets in EDC in Vegas， In any EDC I'm in Vegas， So that's the one to do。

 Anybody not know what EDC is， It's just a huge， huge， crazy-raved， Music Festival here in Vegas。

不许认识， scenario，相当公司，困惑的，产品，合理的，Right， So it doesn't really matter if you're talking for 20 30 minutes。

 if you're just， not really giving the girl anything， It's just a good techniqueiques a kind of like。

 just say a lot of words that actually delivering any mean， news behind what you say。

 if you're going to invest， or if you're going to talk at all to the girl， make it kind of like that。

 it's kind of like establishing commonalities out of the girl， Right。

 or like when you reward the things this girl saying， by you rewarding what the girls saying。

 you're still contributing to the conversation，刷求我是要完全放入外觀，以他的方向來，看é，甚麼呢，這輌的觀 subtle，一般說，你看直背身顯示。

你看是不是，這個手法，BG，The caveat to it is this， after you've kissed。

 after you're at a certain point in the conversation，。

 where you have some attraction with each other， which might be after several minutes，。

 and I'm not saying it's got to be an hour into the conversation。。

 After you've already established the attraction， the risk of putting too much in the conversation goes away kind of。

， Right？ The key is to build as much attraction equity as possible before you over-invest。， Right？

 That's the same reason why I like doing indirect game。

 because I can be indirect and super suggestive，， with the glass on the ass thing we talked about yesterday。

 some other very suggestive innuendos，， and not over-invest until I basically build up my like every breaker rapport and qualifiers。

， building up my attraction meter with the girl， and then after I kiss，。

 after I've established a little bit more with the girl。

 then you can give a lot more into the conversation，。

 without any risk of any of over-investing basically。， Really。

 the name of the game is whoever's investing the most is more attracted than the other。。

 That's kind of where frame control comes into place as well， right？。

 It's like with Kenny came into the set， right？， Or like let's say any guy comes into your interactions。

， All you have to do to distract them is not amog the guy， right？。

 Not be over-elf or over-aggressive。， Just ask them a simple question that the guy might be interested in。

， and then every five seconds that he talks about the question that you said，。

 he's fitting into your frame， and just seers him away from the girl that you're trying to talk to，。

 or that your buddies try to talk to。， You don't have to be louder， you don't have to be stronger。。

 You just have to get him distracted on some random topic of conversation，。

 and that's now him fitting into your frame basically。， Does that make sense？。

 It's the same thing with the girl， right？， It's the same thing over-investing with the girl。。

 The more that you can get her talking about random， did you want to see something？。

 Add a question about this。， Just shut it out as long as it's on the topic we're talking about。。

 Well， basically， something you said earlier about stories，， basically。

 are you trying to say that it doesn't matter what story you tell。

 as long as she's one telling stories？， What I'm gonna say is this。， What I'm saying is this。， Okay。

 so the worst thing to do is you not tell any awesome stories， and her not telling awesome stories。

 and you have nothing with it。， Like， there's just nothing。， It's just two people， like。

 physically standing within proximity of each other。， That's the worst。。

 The next best thing is you tell an awesome story that just hilarious，， it makes you look good。

 it's just awesome， and she's not telling anything。。

 You could fuck a decent amount of girls off that，， just because they're so interested in the story。。

 Okay， the higher value thing to do is you don't really tell any stories about yourself，。

 and you get her to feel some need within her to tell you all these awesome stories about herself。。

 And then every once in a while， you throw her a bone。， Get it？， Yeah。。

 You throw her a bone of a great story about yourself。， That's the worst thing to do right there。

 because it all works on her。， Sweet。， Yeah。， We got it。， Because to be honest。

 it's kind of easy to come up with a bunch of cool shit about yourself。， Like。

 if you're in this room， you've probably all traveled a bit。， You probably all have some passion。

 some probably decent job。， You probably have some certain things that you could brag about to girls。

 or talk about in a way that makes you look good。， What's so much more effective is getting the girl to think that she。

 for some reason，， must have this need in her to qualify herself to you and basically wrap about herself to you。

， That's a lot stronger。， So， bathing questions。， Yeah。

 so the bathing questions that you're talking about， right， I would call what， you think？。

 A qualifier。， Okay。， Then another caveat or another asterisk， huh？， Yeah。

 an example for a biting question。， Do you want to throw an outer？， You want to meet an example？。

 One that he said earlier， right？， I used to do this for the guys that worked with me for a year or longer。

， I had this crazy graphic detail of， it was crazy。。

 There was different stages of qualifier for where they are in the conversation。。

 There's a level one through ten qualifier。， So a level one qualifier would be like， take a guess。。

 Huh？， What's your name？， Right？， Where are you from？， Level one， approaching level two。， Right？。

 Level eight。， Level nine would be like， which one of your family members touched you and appropriately when you were a kid？

， That's ten。， Yeah， I don't even know。， I just left the room there。。

 Level nine is all I've ever said to girls。， It's just to kind of give you the range， right？。

 So then， like， huh？， Yeah， so five would be like， so five would be like， what's。。。， Okay， so like。

 I had this all written out and I threw it away through the exact numbers away。。

 It's like four to six， right？， Like a four would be。

 what's the craziest adventure you've ever been on？， Right？。

 And then it's kind of up to the girl to answer it in a four way or like a three way。， Huh？。

 See what I did there？， Like， it's up to the girl to kind of fit one way or the other， okay？。

 There's。。。， Well， one thing that we're going to do at the last hour of today is really the last 30 minutes of the day。

， Is we're going to come up with our levels of qualifiers that。。。。

 Just so we can kind of rattle them off when we're in set。。

 That are at least some progression of one to ten without necessarily labeling them one through ten，。

 because that's kind of intense。， But you want at least know what's a stronger question path to lead them down。

， That way you can always。。。， That way I don't want to ever want you guys in set。， Like。

 when you guys leave here， the best thing that。。。， The biggest compliment to me would be that you guys actually have some structure that you go off of sometimes。

， But then you can kind of like grab a hold of any time you're not sure where you are in a set or in an interaction。

， I'm cheating up for sure。， Sweet。， Yeah， for me that's the greatest thing。

 because it's like six months later from now，， even if like you're having like a really shitty like。

 let's see you get a relationship， you leave it。， At least you can kind of like remember destruction。

， At least you can kind of remember this funny。， We should all like play to those ringtones and we'll tell you like。

 what kind of like people we all are。， It would be pretty funny。， Mine's 6。79 by Felly Watt。

 which is saying。， So it's true。， The standard is on the iPhone 6。， What did you say？。

 Mine's what I was saying。， Yeah。， I got some slides too。， Yeah。， Because I'd say that when I。。。。

 Mine used to be fuck up some commas and I changed it to 6。79。。

 My fuck up some commas went up to a lot with the game。 That was pretty funny。。

 Like I'd like call myself or like just press the ringtone button。， Well that was on。。

 And you can see like girls just like freak out like in the middle of the store is pretty funny。。

 The fuck up some commas is a good one。， So back to this。 The level of qualifiers， right？。

 Ideally like you're doing。。。， You go off and you like。。。， You do a bunch of self-immusionment stuff。

， You do a bunch of inner game stuff。， If I could just like imparting you guys like a reasonable rubric or curriculum or step by step approach。

， Then even if like you're like， oh you know what？， I don't really like that part as much。。

 You go off and do some other shit while you're out of night。。

 And then like things aren't going the way you wanted to。。

 You can just come back to this plan and then spur your results forward even further。。

 Does that make sense？， Yeah。， Does that make sense？， Sweet。， So back to the qualifiers， right？。

 I like asking like， what's the worst thing she's ever done while on the job？， Right？。

 Basically making a girl feels shitty but okay for telling you about the shitty thing that she did。。

 Is an amazing qualifier for like mid to transition kind of game。。

 Anything that like makes her feel insecure。， But then you just。。。。

 But like the key to making that not mean is that you really let her know that you're not judging her for it。

， So it's like， like what's the worst thing she's ever did to get fired for example？。

 I think I'll be good then。， Sweet。， You know， the FT thing would be great at manipulating girls。。

 You see I like this entire week we've pulled out very like like five to ten second parts of an entire interaction。

， Pulled it out and assessed it。， And then we're just putting it back in。。

 That way we're not really making you guys like， I'm not trying to make you guys like routine based。。

 I'm just trying to hone specific parts of your conversational structure so that you can really crush it。

， Okay。， So this is an example of that。， So this way if you should be able to take any qualifying question at all and turn it into a qualifying statement。

 super easy。， Okay。， Makes sense？ I think it makes sense right？， Let's do it。， So go for it。。

 First step。， So a qualifying question and a qualifying statement based on that question。， Okay。。

 Qualifying the question。， You are with your cousins here。， Are you？， Are you？。

 What are we going to do this fucking guy？， Technically what？， What Jacob's got a good one？。

 I got a Joie's man。， What'd you say？， That's a real idea。。

 That reminds me of the Transylvania voice。， I have a pretty future era。。

 Did I say they don't whisper to you？， That's what he just said。， All right。。

 So what's the problem with what he just said？， I mean， what's the good thing that he just said？。

 Technically， I guess it is a question， right？， But what's the problem with it？， We have an R2。。

 Yeah。， So yes and no problem。， Yeah， but like you set a statement and then said basically you basically said to。

 huh？， Right？， You're like， you basically gave the qualifying statement， right？， Yeah。。

 The statement that you said is you look like you're with your cousins。， Yeah， yeah。。

 Or you look like you're with family members， right？。

 That's actually a pretty good qualifying statement， but it's a statement not a question。。

 What are you hearing with my cousins？， Oh， you're into the cousin。， Yeah， yeah。， You're what？。

 You're into the cousin thingy。， I dream the cousin。， But what do you mean this guy？。

 The fucking your cousin wanted to be the guy？， Two weeks ago。， Yeah， two weeks ago。， Okay。， Yeah。

 they're into the cousin thingy。， I like that he said thingy。， You're into the cousin thingy。， Okay。

 so let's look at it a little bit different， right？， So to make yours a little bit better， right？。

 And again， these aren't things。， These aren't like， this isn't something you'd want to do in order。。

 This is just two different versions of it to help you not get into interview mode。。

 Just to help you think that each question you ask could be delivered as a statement。， It's like。

 walk up the girl and being like， I'm going to take an easy one from you guys。。

 What do you do for work？， You look like a nurse。， Let's say the girl doesn't look like a nurse at all。

， Let's say there's no， she's not wearing a， I was going to say， smock。， I don't know what is it。。

 How fit， whatever， a uniform。， Yeah， scrubs。， Yeah， scrubs。， There you go。。

 She's not wearing a scrubs， nothing like that。， Let me just say you look like a nurse。。

 It's completely irrelevant if she looks like a nurse or not。

。
