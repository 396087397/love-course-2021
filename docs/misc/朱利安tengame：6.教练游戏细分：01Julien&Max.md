What kind of male can afford being vulnerable？，Right？，On the most micro level， let's even that。

You know， this is a technique from the old school p-way， It's disqualifying yourself， right？。

 You disqualify yourself， You know， it looks like you're an alpha male。

 Because you're so cool that you can afford， Disqualifying yourself， So it's really like。

 Like an alpha male is the only guy who can say shit， Like， yeah， I'm a fucking nerd。

 And I'll you probably think I'm not cool， Because the girl's like， well， he says that。

 So he must be really cool， You know， so this whole vulnerability， vulnerability， It's just。

 it's powerful， Especially when you want to connect to a girl a lot more， I would say like。

 for example， upon polling， And you do the， I saw you doing that， As well when we're on tour。

 You have fun with a girl and I club you're the boss， You're the shit， right？ And she's like。

 I'm wet for this guy， I want to fuck him， And upon polling once you're one and one with her into cab。

 Or alone at your place， I love showing a little bit more of a vulnerability， Vulnerable side。

 She's like， oh， you're such a player， I'm like， yeah， you know， I'm a player now， But you know。

 as a kid， I was fucking chubby， I was a loser like， I would never even talk to a girl like you。

 And that is 1% honest， And girls that are just like， oh my god， He's so amazing， Like。

 he's the tall alpha male， He gives me the emotions he does taking a shit from me， Well。

 at the same time， he's a real human being， He's a real fucking person。

 And the other two on the more technical side， That I love about， say you're a cool guy。

 And you're like， oh， I'm really shy， Is that you get the girl to brag for you。

 Just told a little sign out there， Cause you know there's that thing where it's like you can't brag for yourself。

 You're like， hey， I make a lot of money， It's super try hard， it's bad， But if you're friends。

 it says it， it's cool， However， if you for example， say you get you know。

 You wear something very expensive， And you're like， oh， I'm so poor， She's gonna be like。

 wait a minute， no， he's not， He's rich， So she brags for you so you indirectly can do it。

 I talk about this in the natural as well like wing game dynamics。

 Like it could literally be your weight， You know like as long as it's not you。

 It can't be try hard if somebody else， Like you literally like what I would do back in the days。

 Oh tell my wing man dude， let's go to this girl， And after 20 seconds。

 You mentioned that I do parkour， Like back then I did parkour and like with the lips and shit。

 He's like okay， so walk over to the girls， Startled out， he's like hey bro， How was parkour today？

 And they're like， Oh you do parkour， I'm like， I'm not a big deal， you know like， So easy。

 I had that time too with my wings with like mentioning like， Either my job or the whole media thing。

 Where it's like one minute in， They come up like oh is he talking about the media thing again。

 And I'm like， no teller， she's like wait what thing， I'm like， oh I don't want to talk about it。

 it was just it was fun， Oh dude， by the way back in the days when that media thing is。

 I use your videos to pull as well， Like I'd be like do you guys know this guy called Julian Belonk。

 Yeah I think I saw him on TV， I'm like， Really crazy right？， Like you know what？。

 You should watch his media， And then I pull him to my plate。

 Watch some of your videos and I can look， It was so good， I have an wonder like that too。

 Actually I had two words like one， I was like yeah look at this guy。

 And she didn't realize it was me， And then I'm actually I'm with Demi。

 Demi's like don't think kind of look alike， And she's like wait a minute。

 And then I actually pulled her， And then I actually was the one thing she's like okay let's go。

 And then， Well get that call in Chicago too， When we were doing a book together。

 It was a super hot red her chick， And then you go home with her and she's like so。

 Most hated mad into， Dude it's ridiculous yeah， I love that， it's the ultimate bad boy you know。

 Yeah and even that's like making it part of her game， Kind of linking it to like assuming it。

 It's like yeah what's up， This is me media thing and it's like， Oh he's an apologetic。

 he's cool about it， Like by talking to me like always a cool guy bang。

 But I like that vulnerability thing， Where it's you have to be vulnerable。

 And like really get rid of that label of being like， Oh it's like a lane thing to do。

 It's a beta thing to do， It's actually a lot harder to be vulnerable， Than not vulnerable。

 It's easier to put on the fronts， And once you can kind of bring that out。

 Like that's when I also really started， Enjoying my interactions。

 Like there's of course different times， Where you kind of amp up。

 How vulnerable like say when you're pulling， You can kind of amp it up like you said I do that too。

 But even like as soon as you hook， That's like when the vibing starts， And that's what makes it fun。

 Is it's no longer can't do this， Than I'm doing this， It's like here you are with like a cool girl。

 And it's like oh now she's my friend， Now I can relax and actually just enjoy the company。

 And that's like the most like favorite times， Like that's how the night flies by。

 That's how the interactions fly by， And that's like the best part of the game actually， Yeah。

 why don't you set a grid， Because that's where game sees this to be a chore。

 So many guys right on our nation on the inner circles， On the comments on YouTube。

 They're like how many times a week do it have to go out， Like have to go out and take a second。

 Well it takes a lot of energy， Because it takes energy to put that mask on to keep it on， Right。

 But once you let go of this fall self that you have to be。

 And you can just fully enjoy a presence like you said， It's no energy。

 It's like it takes as much energy as when you're sitting on the couch， Playing PlayStation。

 You know， it's just like I'm just here and I'm enjoying it。

 And that's where the game becomes so effortless， And it's really really amazing。

 And I have to mention something too， It kind of fits into that as well。

 Because about this cycle it takes too much energy as， Whenever like my entire growing up。

 And I still catch myself thinking that， I was always like。

 What's the type of guy that girls like the most？， I would see some bad boy in the club totally owning it。

 The tattoos， the rocks， our jacket， And like he makes out with some hot and like。

 That's the guy I'm gonna be， I need to be more a bad boy guy， Right？

 And then a week later I would see like the nice， Well-roomed guy in the suit making out with the guy。

 I was like， no， that's the guy right， And there's all these types that you try to strive for。

 And you give 30% of your energy to be that guy， 30% of your energy to be that guy。

 And you're left with， Fuck， with 40% of being you， And that's not a lot。

 So I really realized when it came to Soul Natural Game notion， And I learned that very late。

 In my PUA journey， if you will， in my game journey， Once you stop trying to be that type。

 And you fully take the energy to being your type， To being you。

 Because nobody can be better at being a certain type than you being yourself。

 And that's where shit just happened easily， And automatically and effortlessly， Yeah。

 I was trying to get inspired by the people， But I never try to become them。

 And I actually went through the same thing， Where it's like you'd see。

 Like guys who are really charismatic， Like you know， take Johnny Depp in a movie， And I'm like。

 fuck， I need to be more like that， And then you see some other guy who's。

 Johnny Depp's more like cool on the effeminate side。

 But then there's like other guys like cool say on the mask inside， Like super jacked and shit。

 And I'd be like， oh， I need to be more like that， Like that， like is it。

 And I think actually funny enough with instructors， This happens too， It's like you may see。

 you know， some guy says watch the video of me， He's like， fuck。

 I heard a bit more enjoying doing this， Then he's seen some video of you who say， boom。

 do you want me to be more of this， And instead of seeing like the。

 He inspired how we bring who we are out， And see， oh， how can I bring that out。

 It's like you're always just torn trying to mimic， And I was be like a poor man's version。

 And this is a nice new game， But everything， like even public speaking， I remember I was。

 In the beginning I was trying to， When I first started touring with Owen， I was like， oh。

 I must be like， oh， and then， Yeah， I mean， everyone goes kind of through that， And then it's like。

 you know， I realized that's not my strength， Like I cannot go on like long rants。

 Talking about every little angle， But I can keep things very like， do this， this， this。

 So it's like giving us， Exactly， leverage your own strengths and build upon those， Yeah。

 that's exactly that， I agree with one percent， And then through references， it's like， oh。

 it's good enough， You know， and kind of build that confidence， Yeah， even me， like， as I said。

 like switching out of routines， Like I started off with routines。

 And I remember it was around the time， Like transformations first was about to come out。

 Or came out and there was a lot of focus on that， On that whole shift back then， It was like。

 fuck the routines， fuck routines， So I was like， okay， fuck the routines。

 And I remember going out like that first time， And I'm like， I'm just not going to do routines。

 And it was like， you felt so naked， And it was just so bad， And it was like。

 that was like my baby step towards kind of， Making it more me， But I remember like。

 I did one night where it's actually me， Whereas like， I felt naked and it's like。

 just talking about whatever I was saying， But then I took all that contents and made that the routine。

 So it's the same thing instead of getting it from online， It was from me， So it was better。

 but it was still like hiding behind those same fucking lines， And same stories now。

 So it's also yeah， I'd say a big part is also not getting pegged in any certain way of doing something。

 It's like if you say a joke that's congruent， They're like， oh， let's keep saying it。

 It's cool for a while， but after a while it's like if you get trapped in。

 It's like you willing to constantly just break it and kind of jump into it。

 You want to be able to make it feel like too， Yeah， this whole like dude， things are changing。

 It's like human condition to try to hold on to anything， Like it's always been that way。

 I've always done that kind of game， It's just become robotic and then you don't have that feeling。

 Like there's like six months in your life， Where you are feeling like that totally happy guy。

 And your game is just like super positive， And then you like slowly that become more thoughtful。

 tired， burnt out， whatever， And you try to do this happy game right。

 And you become try hard and that's where you hit the next plateau。

 Because you're trying to do this game that was back then congruent to what you're feeling in that very period of your life。

 And you're trying to force it back into that， Instead of going with the stream going down with the stream。

 Swimming with the stream of life， Where you now might feel a little bit more burnt out and leverage that。

 And so you've got to realize like just because that style of game worked so well for you。

 In the last year， last week or whatever， It doesn't mean it's always going to be like that。

 So a good PUA or a guy who's good with girls， Always realizes what he's feeling like。

 He taps into that and he's able to play the game accordingly if you won't， Yeah， that was。。。。

 That happened actually on a more micro level to me too， During a period of time。

 I love to recreate these。。。， Sounds so cheesy， these movie scenes。

 So I'd watch a movie and it would be super congruent， Because I was all about it。

 so I'd go out and my game was a long go lines of that movie， But the next movie I saw， oh。

 it was long of that movie， It's still coming from that you， but it's like， yeah， don't pag yourself。

 I'm only this， And I'd say to you just also how this applies to learning game。

 With the whole era of YouTube and all this advice， It's that more and more。

 not only in terms of going out or we devaluing who we are inside。

 But also in terms of the advice we take， There's so many resources， which is fucking awesome。

 But a trend is like a lot of guys are now solely looking externally for advice。

 And they never listen to anything internal， So it's like， well。

 how could anything that's coming from me internally， Who I am is good enough。

 I need the confirmation of this YouTube person to tell me it's okay， I need it from elsewhere。

 so instead of a healthy balance， Where it's like， you take some from you and then use inspiration。

 It's like solely external， And you can just see it in a lot of the questions。

 Like either at free tours， hot seats， boot camps， Even in the Facebook groups。

 icy questions like so common sense， I'm like， why are you asking this？。

 And I just want to say like a big reason， Say I was able to be modest， like。

 give where I'm at today， Those questions， like， I didn't ask them。

 Those questions didn't end up in my mind， And I think it's。。。 Sorry， No， no， no。

 I think it's because we're spoiled， We're like a kid that always gets money from their parents。

 It's never going to get a great job， So it's like， well， there's all these answers。

 All these questions out there， people forget to think for themselves， Which is again， like you said。

 it's a great thing， There's not only information out there， but we kind of stop being self-reliant。

 Stop listening to our gut feel， And human beings are innately social creatures。

 We are meant to grow up in a tribe， And understand just with our gut feeling， Like， okay。

 the sea alpha male， this is the girl， This is where I am in the hierarchy。

 And I can act accordingly， This person is now pissed， I see that this tribe member is now pissed。

 So I got to tone it back， throw it in the state and defend with me， But we lost that。

 threw it at the overflow of information， Because I'm like， well， fuck my gut feeling。

 Here's the expert， I'm just doing what he says， And then we kind of drown our gut feeling。

 And we spread it up with all this external information。

 And then we started asking all these questions， Like， our gut feeling knows it。

 but we're stopping listening to it， Yeah， we do that with the content， We do that even in pick-up。

 Where it's like， there's something you want to say if you suppress it， Like， please everyone else。

 It's like， it's pretty fucking bad， And another thing， too， it'll happen with the contents。

 And if you're watching this， be careful， It's like。

 there's so much content that you try to piece it all together， It's like。

 you think there's like a grand theory of game， And you don't get that it's emotional that there are different paradoxes。

 You have to like， grasp， And guys get lost just conceptualizing everything。

 And there's no real life experience， They can't get that a lot of this comes before words。

 It's emotional and big you lost in that， And you'll never find like the grand theory of what。

 Like the grand logical theory of game， which is safe， Yeah， it's super true， Like。

 the moment my game， as it's the same with you， The moment your game in general tapes off。

 It's the moment where you're so busy with your hands and the dirt。

 Taking action that you don't even have the time to look up， And think about the theory。

 You're just like， I'm fucking going out， Like， my brain does， it's so focused on the shit。

 That I can't even have the energy to think about random fucking bullshit。

 But it's the same with work right now， Now you just drop the 10 game， I drop the natural very soon。

 And it's like， you're so immersed in work， That like， all these random things that people ask you。

 Like， what？， I don't even understand people are asking you especially， Like in Austria and other。

 those are so like， Like political off people， because like some party。

 Whenever I didn't even notice that， I'm like， dude， I don't concern myself there。

 because I have my hands and the dirt， And I'm taking action， it's the same with game。

 If you're noticing yourself that you ask meaningless questions。

 That is the best sign that you're not going out and out， Yeah， oh yeah， at the same time， Yeah。

 I just harp on that too， and kind of like into these videos here。

 We're talking a lot about bringing your uniqueness out， What that is， and understand too。

 if you're watching this video， We can't fully define it， and that's a big one。

 If I was watching this video， I'd want every instructor to define precisely and logically， Like。

 okay， what is your uniqueness？， But as soon as you can actually do that precisely and logically。

 It's no longer unique in a way， If you're watching these videos。

 get inspiration from the vibe that you're getting， by what we're talking about here。

 But don't think that there's like， or for yourself， you don't think that you can。

 Hege yourself in lines， I see that question a lot， what's my uniqueness？。

 It's not something you can put into words， So yeah， I'd say we could， you know。

 slowly wrap it here with， I'd be fun just to share maybe one story or something。

 If you think back to your pick up journey， just kind of reinforce， You know。

 this is about those epic experiences， What would be like one of your most memorable experiences in game。

 Whether it be a crazy pull， whether it be something cool，。

 whether it be like a flak toe you broke through， whether it be like one of those moments。

 Where it actually felt good because you brought your uniqueness out。

 Like what was like one of your most epic experiences， I'd say， Ah， there's many。

 I want to do two short ones， one longer ones， One was。

 I was having sex with this beautiful blonde girl， And I fucked her on the table。

 And like next to me was my computer， it was like playing random playlists， Right？

 And I had like some like house music on her， right？， So， because it's like nice and sexual。

 And then because it was random， it popped into the fire and flames by Dragon Force。

 And there's hardcore drums and solos， You know， like the soul's sexual mood was just gone。

 And I'm like， oh fuck， sorry， sorry， she's like， no， no， is that what you listen to？， I'm like。

 yeah， it's cool， So， I'm like， all right， so he banged to Dragon Force， If you remember。

 banged to Dragon Force， it's crazy， it's insane， And the other thing is。

 this is something that you mentioned earlier as well。

 With the soul being an RZ instructor in the beginning， you kind of like， you know。

 I'll try and not mention it and things like that， And a transition where I was fully like。

 you know what， that is fucking me， Was， I met a really， really great girl， totally lovely。

 She ended up being a virgin actually， And especially because she wasn't virgin， I'm like， okay。

 well fuck， but I do this pickup thing， And I don't want her to feel bad now that she like loses her virginity。

 She's like， this pickup artist， what not， you know， And I did tell her， And at first， obviously。

 she was pissed， But then， you know， I'm like， you know what， that's really， that's just me。

 And I appreciate you so much that I wanted to be honest with you。

 And it was me safe that I didn't tell you in the beginning from the get-go， But now。

 I feel really good， Because I can fully let myself go with you and I can fully be myself。

 And I appreciate that so fucking much， And then we ended up hanging out a little more a couple more days。

 And I had to keep traveling after that， And we weren't touched for a very， very long time。

 And she started watching my videos， And she started quoting myself， you know。

 So we were doing like WhatsApp texting， And she's like， oh hey， like you said in that video。

 It's all about the， the， the， the， the， and I'm like damn， This is cool。

 And then I don't remember if it was my birthday or something like that。

 She sent me a picture of a t-shirt she had made， And that t-shirt had the Jurassic Park logo。

 you know， like a dinosaur， And instead of Jurassic Park， it said， RZ Max， And I'm like， this is。

 this is really fucking amazing， So here I am the manipulative pick of artists， And it's bad。

 you know， but yet because I was myself， And I was fully opening myself up being vulnerable。

 And the girl actually liked me even more， And that made me like her even more。

 And our connection got a lot deeper and greater， Nice， Yeah， actually that， that whole like。

 Being yourself to you， I forgot to mention this before， When we hear， for example。

 like be a cool guy， That's the mistake we make is like we try to， Look at a cool guy and mimic them。

 Or what they like， Or the body language they have， someone and so forth， Without seeing behind that。

 that cool guy， Took us when he can just amplified it。

 And that cool guy is not concerned about things like body language。

 So the fact that you're concerned about say， Stifling yourself in a certain way。

 that's like the opposite of what it means to be a cool guy， So just a little sign out， Yeah， I mean。

 yeah， thanks for sharing that， I'd say before you wrap， if there's any last thing。

 You just want to share on this topic and you last advice， Oh yeah。

 What many people don't know about Julian， Is that he has the weirdest taste for music I've ever seen。

 Do people even know， dude？， We talked about being ourselves here， Get it out， man， Just let it out。

 Dude， I actually never， I actually don't watch that， Actually， that's a good ending for it， Okay。

 so this is actually the first time I'm publicly putting this out， So， he weirdest， Okay。

 I like to say I have very good taste in music， But then I have my good taste。

 And then I have my guilty pleasure taste， And my guilty pleasure， I'm like， bless you my girl。

 My guilty pleasure is the girliest music you could possibly think of， Like。

 that's the stuff like on tour， You'd think I'm like all like fucking like fuck， bitches and stuff。

 It's actually like girly shit， Like， you would think if you were a girly shit， Like， oh。

 like Taylor Swift and that's one of them， But even girlier than that， Like。

 to the point where it's like musicals， like high school music， Oh my god， dude。

 that's boring with triple in this D-Wers， Because he blasted that shit。

 And I was at a once on his head， I'm lonely human， Blame it up， fuck down， He was such a。。。。

 I'm only human， I forgot it since the last time I was on repeat too， Yeah， yeah， That's the work。

 He listens to like these like 15-20 songs， He chooses one song， And he listens to so many times。

 Like four months， You're just like， Yeah， Glad that is out now， Mr。 Blanc， I will say like， Dude。

 the latest one is even worse， The latest one is this band called like， Simirelli with a C。

 And it's like these six sisters who sing together， And they just dropped their album。

 And I pre-ordered that album once ago， And it finally came out。

 And it's like something like little teens or twigs， Finally came out， And I was like， go ahead now。

 like， I have it like， boom， pimped it， and shit， Like bring a girl back， And I checked this out。

 Simirelli， So yeah， just。。。， Is he there or no？， Is he there or no？， Because he。。。， No。

 but he's not here now， He's not in that too， Like I played it so much in tour with him。

 But after a while we were both at the airport， Like just both listening to fucking Simirelli。

 So yeah， I'd say a good example of like， whatever you're in tune， No matter what it is。

 just embrace it， And there you have it。
