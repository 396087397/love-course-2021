 some ways to kind of get out of your own way， and this should be。

 okay the ideal is to reach the state of being， where you're just always out of your own way。

 and you just kind of embrace everything and nothing matters， but one technical thing you can do。

 in the doing to get to the being， is merging sets， this is big， part of you getting your own way。

 is that pressure where there's scarce opportunities， for example， if you only talk to hot girls。

 it'll be very hard bringing that fun personality out， because your options are limited。

 you fuck it up with two or three hot girls there， you're done so you need to find ways to place yourself in abundance。

 one way is to learn how fun genuine fun talking to every girl， hot or not it doesn't matter。

 on top of that too if you're only talking to hot girls。

 and you can't have fun talking to girls you don't find attractive， you're taking。

 you're trying to take you're like oh she's not attractive there's nothing to take。

 if you already had everything it didn't matter， if you're coming from abundance you wouldn't care。

 you know， really too you should have just as much fun talking to a girl， it's no girl。

 by the mere fact that you need a girl there you're also taking。

 but merging sets helps with that because， basically instead of going up and having these unique interactions where you're like。

 you open it ends， you open it ends you introduce the girls to each other， by doing that。

 you are now talking to a lot of girls at the same time。

 and if one rejects you you sell all the other girls there。

 a lot of that pressure is off now you're going to bun it。

 the more options you have the more mistakes you can make。

 the more you allow that realness to come out， you're not obsessing over not making mistakes。

 okay you can also play， off the social proof where if there's a girl with you。

 another girl is going to you know it's going to be way easier to open another girl。

 like that's the ideal it's like you never open a new girl without another girl in hand。

 and you can create a nice fun vibe with them， and that little vibe that you created with a girl。

 check this out to the new girl， okay and it's easy to do guys over read complicate this just by hey me my friend。

 me my girlfriend me my sister whatever it is， that's it okay and usually what I'll do to kind of。

 give myself into a very social state fast is whenever I go to a venue。

 understand this how you feel okay in the beginning。

 until you can really achieve this state of just being where it doesn't matter where you're at。

 it's very dependent on the environment so you probably realize this。

 sometimes you'll get into a very social mood where you're very carefree and at ease。

 in this part of the venue or or in a bar let's just say if you go out in the。

 street it kind of resets there's always a reset in a new environment。

 the same if you're out of it if you're feeling horrible and stressed out in a bar。

 you got in the street feel a little bit better， not good it's just reset this applies to different venues like in a venue。

 outside of a venue but also parts of the venue so you could feel better。

 be near a bar area than near a dance floor area okay and to kind of。

 get yourself in that zone very fast the smaller the surface。

 the faster you'll get in the zone so usually what I'll do is I'll go out。

 I'll pick a little area of the venue where there's like a you know a good。

 amount of traffic or some people to talk to and I'll just stay in that。

 little area that little small service and I'll just merge everyone together。

 that skyrocket's me in the fucking zone and then I kind of just let that。

 expand throughout the entire venue okay something to keep in mind。

 and we'll crack into some ways to merge， okay now this one here I basically open this girl like I printed。

 just opened her I know nothing about her and I go from her and her friend。

 within like a minute or so to having all these girls around me。

 okay don't overthink merging guys are like oh I must do this is me my friend。

 okay on top of that too if you overdo the introductions the girl will be。

 hesitant because it seems like you're trying to trick her。

 understand that if even if you're introduced a girl to your friend most。

 guys like hey so come meet my friend he's really cool the fact you're。

 putting in so much efforts for something as simple as her meeting your。

 friend seems like there's a catch it's like why is he trying so hard what's。

 here versus hey can be my friend okay so I'm walking out with her nice to me。

 my god nice to meet you just opened Julian it sounds kind of girlish。

 but it's amazing is that do you say that's everyone in South of。

 Carolina well I feel bad because every time I say it everyone's like。

 Julian yeah so I always feel bad so I adjust upon myself because I'm。

 insecure you don't you don't look when you say it that you don't。

 pronounce the a my friend Ryan getting engaged bang my friend Ryan he's。

 getting engaged so I go from me and two girls I introduce him to my buddy。

 Ryan he's with the girl he's not getting engaged but again that's like the。

 inside joke I kind of create I do a lot of roleplays when merging it's kind。

 of like check this out he's getting engaged this makes me feel good。

 introduce the two girls to Ryan and the girl so goes from me and two girls。

 to me Ryan and three girls and that's it hey he's getting engaged say hi it's。

 fun it's offering value but it's simple I don't oversell it I don't， overdo it。

 I actually say take your shots， is it deal right now， yeah， do it， just do it， just do it。

 take your time and you can't buy it， this is my other friend by the way， hey， I'm a friend。

 bang bring in my other friend Matt I'm like oh this is my other friend。

 okay I merged with girls I merged with my wings I merged with everyone。

 I'm always like bring more people into the fun okay oh it's my other friend。

 just don't think that it can go， bang open this girl hey come。

 now why does she come immediately too because I'm in the center of all this。

 party with all these fucking girls around me versus some random dude like， hello you know。

 are you friend of this， this is my friend is getting engaged。

 it's my friend is getting engaged it's a right in the girl， that's me too。

 I'm gonna do bang open her， great， I don't judge， wait come here my girlfriend， girlfriend。

 this is my girlfriend， like come eat my girlfriend I tell the other one this is my girlfriend。

 introduce them to each other， she's so Connecticut， this is her friend， they're my friends my lady。

 look at it just surrounded by all these girls， one minute thirty two seconds。

 yeah come open another one， come just in the circle。

 this is my other friend say out of my girlfriend， and look at this like a minute forty one seconds。

 in this small little environment out here， it's very easy to not get in your own way in a situation like this。

 say I fucked up with one I'm surrounded with all the rest of the girls， and every girl I open。

 she's more open to experiencing me， who is this guy who's already have girls with me。

 and I'm a social proof， it eases the process， merging is huge。

 and you can also do this during the day， have you been to Europe？， yes I have。

 you still live in Germany？， no way， you speak German， you live in Germany， excuse me。

 are you from Miami or no？， bang that's it， all you have to do is， whenever you're talking to a girl。

 start thinking， leaving talk to another girl， start looking around， and bring in more girls。

 bring girls into the fun， where？， Michigan？， really？， yeah， nice to meet you， oh you too。

 hey my friend， she also hates live， this is my note， I didn't see that， boom introduce them。

 you gotta hug you， you're like， okay， but， how far are you？， I'm not， is that your friend？。

 you're not my friend， nice to meet you， nice to meet you， nice to meet you。

 you know if you're four or nine， you're considered a midget， I know and you can do total perks。

 I can't even have size， she can feel right and right， it's a theater point， that's the one。

 we're out of your favor， okay， maybe you wanna go up to the line？， sure， boom， merging， merging。

 it's like all this merging， yes， three， one， zero， okay， maybe my girlfriend， hi， how are you？。

 I'm just gonna use the e-six， do you remember my name？， it's just a million。

 that's the way， that's the way， you know who you get down， hi， let's go out， let's go out。

 we're meeting with Jen over there， oh Jen， what's your mother？， did you see your mother？。

 how old are you？， 19， so young， little baby， I'm 21， why？， I'm way more mature， I'm a mature。

 introduce your mother as your wife， yeah， merge to the right， merge to the right， so I'm like open。

 move， as they're walking， I see another two set walking， I'm like merge to the right。

 merge to the right， again it's like your tarzan， branch to branch， girl to girl， open these two。

 use them to bounce off the next two， thanks， excuse me， oh excuse me， open this girl。

 and you already have the other girl in hand， I want to do this， I'll just say hi。

 just say this for birthday， nice to meet you as long， nice to meet you as long， are you from Brazil？

， then I open the friend of the other one， like oh are you from Brazil？， and again it's like。

 I have fun kind of taking on the accent， it's like me making myself feel good， check this out。

 giving offering value， oh really？， sell a bottle， Brazil， I have a new one， me amigo， hello。

 do you live in Miami now？， yes， do you love it or hate it？， I hate it。

 I live in Los Angeles and I ask， do you hear me？， I'm like， just can't deal， my friend is here。

 it's too pale， you're a friend， yeah， no， I'm a manigo， it's her birthday。

 we're just fucking around， she just turned 18， how old are you？， 23， 23， 23， lies， I'm a third this。

 come with me， you're a man， you're a man？， yeah， Rodrigo， my friends call me Antonio。

 Antonio Mondeiro， zor， I used to have a mustache， like， check this out， it's like here's some fun。

 that's what reals are in， come say hi， hold my， ninho， muy bien， my friend is from Hungary。

 this is Juliots， muy emigo，I think that we should have more， of like a mother-son relationship。

 personally， like if you were like， I'll get married， if I get back， you're like， son。

 this is so inappropriate， your father will be home， any minute， oh my guess， so。

 you don't have to say what I'm saying， okay， she's not gonna get attracted by that。

 she's attracted by how， I feel saying that， which again， makes things worse。

 but we got this little fun vibe going， and with merging， it's like。

 okay let's share this with everyone else， so he actually brings up these other girls。

 hey this is Juliots， Juliots， how's it going？， Juliots， this is my mother， Leah。

 oh this is my mother？， for the merging， it's like keep the fun going， involving more girls。

 my nibutsa， we live in Los Angeles， a lot of plastic surgery， my mother and I were very close。

 super close， honestly， ever since the day I was born， all I wanted was to， crawl back up inside。

 I know， we're a weird little family， don't judge us， it's natural， we're pure。

 our bloodline is pure， we keep it in the family， yeah， there's no intermingling。

 oh you're a Brazilian， you look like a cachorro， you look like a cachorro， cachorro。

 I'm not a cachorro， see， a cachorro， oh， but I got it， a cachorro with me。

 why do I know something like， yeah， I don't know， I'm such a god， if you have wings too。

 it's like that's an awesome way to just build fun， it's like say it's two or three of you。

 you'll split out， each spring girls back， and introduce them， and then you can make it fun。

 create these awkward plot lines， like my mother， my sister， random shit， but merging。

 and then you can add that to your game。
