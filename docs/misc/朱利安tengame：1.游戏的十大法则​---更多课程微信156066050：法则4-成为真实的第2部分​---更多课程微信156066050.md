你真的必顿笑，仍然就是这样的人，而是什么作被知道，然后最忙碌昏行，就是能搞你心情。，好，哎，不会怕叽，这是什么逃勢吗？，那是你。。。，孩子哥媽的地方，人格很執行，是的，但是他被建造到，應該是，很不強的。

嗎？，另一個人，只需要用Wr sind， rum Li，也有時候，某一個人，就算的，有人 Appealing，他會要胡亩，也不許忘記，他在旁邊。

 Especially when there are eyebrows。， When a brain neapuesture is one，， only with a giflet Nyron-。

usty， Then if we talk about soft underlying，它的角色 has a lot of different types of，或者專公站，。

从那个时候市场 worthwhile wie，每个人都有这个量，，你aling through attraction，来讲分析是与你的，现在是没有，，掑着我鼻子，，现在就是没有厉害者 göra。

 Doing that exercise too， where you eliminate the outcome， you can attach with realness，ok。

 beyond that too， a lot of it's embracing， you know it's like we're always ashamed。

 like oh is this good？， is it bad？， once again， fucking labels， it's like this emotion is good。

 I'm feeling this， this emotion is bad， embracing what you think， that's another one。

 it's like you run out of things to say， be real， stop living up to our image， say。

 here's another one， you run out things to say， tell you right now things to say， done。

 now it's real， now you have something to talk about， running out of things to say。

 what can you say about that， if you like shit， tell you if you like shit， you're sad。

 tell you if you're sad， ok， don't judge the emotions， just acknowledge them and say， it's real。

 what's real has value， you know I'd explain this， actually last weekend on program in Vegas。

 and a guy， you know on the first night， the next night he's， the next day he was out。

 and he saw this girl in a coffee shop， and he did well， because he saw the girls like ok。

 I don't really feel good right now， I'm kind of tired， kind of grumpy， didn't have my coffee yet。

 but I'm just going to offer some value， and you know offer her some good emotions， so he does that。

 and he like put on a smile， like gave her some good emotions， that's good。

 but what could he've also done， simply just go up， and tell the girl he's grumpy， being grumpy。

 offer value being grumpy， you're not taking， that doesn't mean like， trying to get her to fix you。

 from being grumpy， but you're like hey， you know I'm really grumpy， don't I'm a coffee yet。

 offer that， you're offering realness， who says that's bad， ok and that too。

 it's like we're conditions， like you just always feel， like feel amazing， it's like。

 yeah that's value， but if you don't， you saw the realness， always be real。

 that's it's same as like being congruent， if I'm like， if I go out。

 usually in the beginning of the night， I don't feel the same as say halfway through。

 in the beginning， do I feel， would it be real， let's just say for me to walk up， you like。

 hey how's it going， not really， because I kind of just got there， so I'm not going to force it。

 I'm not going to fake it， usually in the beginning， I'm like hey how's it going， nice to meet you。

 you from LA， oh cool， these are my friends， that's it， if it's congruent， it's real。

 that's where the value is， value that， above reaching a certain point， ok， don't force it。

 just kind of let it arise， always be congruent， how you feel， ok， now ideally， again。

 linking it back to expansion， you're kind of leaning over the edge of caguracy。

 so through the nights， more and more， will be real， taking it further too。

 that also means being clear in your intentions， you probably heard this， don't be friend to friend。

 be man to woman， that's also part of being real， letting her know， what's up， letting her know。

 you're attracted to her， you know， that's who we hide， it's like oh it's not， we can't let her know。

 where you feel ashamed， from guilty， now it's like assume， your desires， put it out there。

 learn how to be real， ok now， one way as well， to kind of get used to this， is you know。

 and I compare this， the training wheels， is you can practice， you know。

 some ways to get used to say， being real in terms of being， man to woman， would be。

 say a few statements of intent， you tell her， hey I like you， hey you're really beautiful。

 daddy's home， there's a great way to start conversation， walk up daddy's home， you can't hide。

 your intent， if you're in daddy's home， ok， now this is not something。

 that you need to do a long term， but doing it for a little while， will get you in touch。

 with hey nothing bad happens， when I'm real， when it's real， hey it's ok to let her know， what's up。

 the sooner you let her know， the better， that's the most guys do， they hide it。

 again a form of manipulation， and then they do like， they talk to her， and like we're friends。

 and then at the end， they you know， we call it reveal the dick， by the way I got a dick。

 I want to fuck you， she didn't know， let her know， when you're sleeping with her。

 she knows you like her， let her know as soon as possible， why you're there， ok it should be。

 clear energy， clear emotions， just clear communication， everything's fucking clear， ok。

 and this also manifest， more so in terms of， eye contact， you probably heard。

 breaking or portanality， where voice kind of goes down， you're like hey。

 that there's the ultimate form， of like seeking approval， manipulation， um。

 you know being a little physical， at times， but， you don't necessarily need to do， all this ok。

 it's a lot of it's in the vibe， being clear in your intent， isn't something you do。

 it's something she feels， right， would you say even like， you don't even have to say。

 things like dead is home， no， I can go up， I don't have to be physical， I can talk about， my。

 you know， my walk to the club， and be mental， it's like so， I took， my first step。

 and then I took my next step， she knows I like her， like I took my first step。

 and then my next step， like physical， it's like you can even be physical， not be mental。

 it's more allowing yourself， to just let it out， allowing yourself。

 to project that emotion in a way， to project that intent， ok， it's like unleashing it。

 getting the blockage， getting whatever you're afraid of， and that too it's like。

 well what am I afraid of， what if I'm real， what am I afraid of， and it goes back to say。

 law one it could be rejection， it could be all she won't like it， it could be once again。

 reminding yourself of your own value， because that too it's like， oh you know。

 she's getting fucked over in the deal， what is it， what's blocking from being real。

 and then just practicing at time， like a few statements， prove yourself， nothing bad happens。

 get used to that emotion， and then hang onto that， like you're rid of the fucking sentences。

 and cultivate that， ok， but this is huge， and has a lot of value， ok， some other training wheels。

 let's just say， one is leading， leading for example， the conversation。

 that too if the girls say talking， about something you don't really like， you can lead out of it。

 you listening to it， pretending to like it， is not being real， cutting certain threads。

 cutting certain topics， disagreeing a little bit， that's huge， you probably hear push pull。

 push pull， is basically the training wheels， for being real， push pull should naturally happen。

 if you're being real， if you're being real， there's gonna be some stuff， the girl resonates with。

 some stuff she doesn't resonate with， there's gonna be some push， it's some pulls。

 you don't have to worry about it， when I'm out， I'm not worrying about， am I doing a push now。

 am I challenging， or am I disagreeing， it just naturally happens， because I'm real。

 but if you're not used to it， you may want to add that training wheel。

 disagree every once in a while， and the last thing too， I'd say in terms of being real， is you know。

 it's really allowing yourself， to be vulnerable in a way， and it's like， there's this saying。

 the more personal， the better， the more personally， make this the better， and this kind of links。

 to being creative， what do you find funny， what do you want to say， what do you。

 even if you say you say something， someone else said， do you actually want to。

 okay but make this really about you， don't try to copy someone else， you copy someone else。

 you become like a poor man's， version of that person。

 it's only powerful if it's really personal to you， okay so bring that。

 to the table。
