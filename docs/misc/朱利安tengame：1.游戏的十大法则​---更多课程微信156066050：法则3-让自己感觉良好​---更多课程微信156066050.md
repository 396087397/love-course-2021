你讓我感受好嗎？，你如何做的呢？，然後我們應該這樣做，，這個就是最重要的，，好嗎？，你讓我感受好嗎？，我一直在做三個舞蹈，，我們都會做的，，好嗎？，這個就是要把你做到，，別說我會做到，。

我會做到我會做到，，但是你不了錢，，的話會靠你找到你，，你為什麼把 pianacher，身體可能可以獨立 my guitar？，這是判決，，我現在去沒有太多參與自己的表現。，判決要我比如說，。

如果你選手，，and number three is passionate and engaged excited， those three interbuttons。

 those three emotions is the shit that everyone fucking chases， everyone wants to have more fun。

 all of you guys here want to have more fun， everyone wants to get more carefree， more ideas。

 feel more relaxed， stop giving a fuck， and everyone wants to be excited， part of something， again。

 part of that passionate vibe， offer that， that's a lot of value。

 and a girl will fuck you to thank you， yes， Can you rewind those buttons again？， yeah。

 in a nutshell， fun， carefree， passion， fun， carefree， passion， and again， with the fun。

 it's like anything that's fun， happy， makes you laugh， makes you smile along those lines， fun。

 carefree， passion， and when you're out， the ideal is get creative， you need to learn to be creative。

 not in terms necessarily of the words you say， but in terms of how you can link everything that you say。

 or the cheese says， or that's happening to these interbuttons， in a way。

 that's what we also did with the， being out of state， or the running out of things to say。

 you're out of things to say， how can you get creative to use this to feel good？， you tell the girl。

 you're out of things to say， because you kind of tell it。

 and then ideally you can maybe exaggerate it a bit， like， hey， I ran out of things to say。

 I should have watched more pickup videos on， you know， there you go。

 now just notice that in the laughter， what do you do？， you use something that could be bad。

 to link it to， carefree， because you're kind of laughing at yourself。

 and fun because you're laughing， you can always link it to one of the three。

 if you're creative enough， to make it work， and this is a little sign-out。

 is why I never have a bad night out， I focus on all the things that we talked about。

 but that creativity， I can link everything to the fun， everything to feeling good。

 I always feel good， I get rejected， how can you link that to feeling good？。

 just a funny thought of you going to somebody， and get rejected。

 and making it like a comedy of errors， could do that， mine is like， she's like， oh。

 I'm not interested， I'm over-exaggerated， I'm not interested， and that makes me so like。

 that's good but be careful， because you're reinforcing like， hurtness and flock her。

 it's against the girl， no， it doesn't really happen to me， it was kind of mean to the girl。

 it's too funny， and Tyler does it like Tyler， he never does that to the girl， well。

 he doesn't do it to the girl， but in his video， don't laugh at the girl， laugh at yourself。

 anything to laugh at yourself， you should get rejected， you can't hide butt hurtness and fun。

 you can't， there should be zero anger towards the girl， zero resentment towards the girl， zero。

 zero， zero， zero， as soon as you feel that， you're already fine， instead。

 why not say something to laugh at yourself， like one my go to is the girl rejects you， she's like。

 hey nice to meet you， no， no， no， but， but I make a lot of money， something like that， super chubby。

 and she's like， what the fuck， like the awkwardness， I'm like， no， no， I don't have a lot of money。

 I have a lot of friends on my phone， check it out， yeah， you know， like she's like that。

 anything reexaggerated， what do you do？， you use the rejections to link carefree fun。

 even passionate， and in a way too， what did you do？， you transformed the event。

 from being a rejection to something fun， it's no longer a rejection， here's a rejection。

 nice to meet you， here's something fun to happen， nice to meet you， I made a lot of money。

 do you see that？， it's not like I rejected， do you see this funny thing？。

 you can get rid of rejections， in a way that， like that。

 get creative to link it to those interbuttions， whatever the girls say。

 get creative to link it to those interbuttions， I focus on the process。

 I'm no longer trying to take something from her， I'm like， how can I use this to have fun。

 how can I use this to gain myself？， yes， so regarding， a perceiving rejection to this fun。

 like two things that help me out was， watching a lot of prank videos。

 and trying to get into mindset of a prankster， like Michelle Lee， that definitely helped me out。

 some of pranksterious videos， and also number two， taking like improv classes。

 like tell you what the matter is， I'm not really sure， oh yeah。

 so those two things that help me a lot， in terms of， actually laugh， laugh and get off。

 and how's the most you're taking things seriously， big， yeah， so what if I'm going to be like。

 be real， genuinely clever， what I do then， tell her， your butt hurt， embrace exactly， laugh。

 tell her your butt hurt， so good， say I'm very butt hurt， I got rejected， you know。

 I'm super butt hurt， I'm trying to be real， but I'm really butt hurt， you know。

 it's like just by embracing it， that's the first step， you're already going to feel way better。

 and now you can kind of embrace those good emotions， and think too。

 good emotions doesn't actually mean， being like on a super high energy， high it just means。

 we're feeling really fucking good， you know， your butt hurt， you don't express your butt hurt。

 you're not going to feel good， being real， and feeling good， kind of go hand in hand， okay。

 but kind of building on what you said， this is pretty key， so what makes you feel good。

 most people don't know， what do you find funny， most people don't know， you need to learn。

 how to spike your own emotions， a trap people， are very logical， can fall into， or anyone。

 if you're kind of， caught up in this pattern of conversation， you will fall into this。

 you're talking， so you get very， interview mode， we're very logical， now you'll be okay。

 I'm very logical， I need to self-emuse， but what do you do， then you try to logically。

 think of something， self-emusing， and now you reinforce the， logicality， so an easy way to kind of。

 snap out， of those patterns， where it gets boring， and shit is do something， out of left field。

 do something that just， interrupts the pattern， it's like a wheel turning。

 you shove a stick in that pattern， you're very logical， blurred out， vaginas， out of the blue。

 something doesn't make sense， like what's your name， vaginas， it'll snap you the， fuck it。

 it'll spike you up， that'll spike your emotions， I do it all the time， or even dumb questions。

 out of left field， they're like， so what's your name， cool what do you mean for breakfast。

 like something like， out of the blue， anything out of the blue， that way， spikes you big time， okay。

 I'm very ADD， anyone who's like， you'll see in my infield， I'm very all over the place。

 like just not for the girl， it's like， spiking my own emotions， and this is key， whenever you see。

 infield， or you see someone， gaming， don't be so focused， on what they're sane， or doing。

 be more focused， instead on how， what they're sane， or doing is making them feel。

 everything that I do， or say， is because it makes me feel， a certain way， and that's the mistake。

 guys make， you might see me say， again， something is a little， out there with my humor。

 and then you think， oh that's what gets the girl， for me to get the girl， hey， and you let the best。

 and you let do what they do， say the same joke， but you're not， going to feel the same。

 don't emulate， the jokes， don't emulate， the doing， emulate the feeling， the being， you should look。

 at how I feel， when I say that， and you ask yourself， get creative， what can you do。

 or say to feel that， same way， to have just as much fun， be more careful， this passionate。

 and kind of linking it， to what we talked about， before， what happens here， once you're able。

 to make yourself， feel safe， once you're able to make yourself， feel so fucking good。

 you no longer need the girl， to feel so fucking good， you manage to get the outcome。

 you're hoping she'll give you， and now you let go of the outcome， and now you get her， super easy。

 okay， and the best way， I kind of like， you know a fucked-up analogy， to illustrate this is。

 I view it as， emotional masturbation， that's literally， the best way， to describe what game is。

 it's you going out， and making yourself feel good， emotionally， you feel fucking awesome。

 what would make， you know， make it fun， you're out in the venue， there's other girls。

 why not have them join it， if the girl joins in， I still feel fucking awesome， but guess what。

 say she rejects me， she's like no， it's still good， you know， it's like， there's no longer。

 that same need， guys， it's too， it's so fucked， but it's too， most guys they go out， and it's like。

 hard on it's like， jack me off， jack me off， jack me off， please jack me off， learn how to make。

 like jack off first， and like， hey join in， join in， join in， that's it， you know， and either way。

 like sometimes， you know， you'll either， like finish together， but if not。

 you're still going to have， awesome time， like your nights， going to be this shit。

 whether you get the girl or not， if you masturbate， it'd be fun to have a join in， if not。

 it's not like I lose anything， I'm still feeling good， I'm still feeling amazing。

 I'm still gaming myself， okay， that's game， learn how to emotionally， masturbate。

 learn how to emotionally， feel the way you're hoping， the girl will make you feel， you can do it。

 if you're creative enough， okay， another exercise you can do is， you know。

 whenever you hit those moments， where you're like， in state or in the zone。

 reflect on those moments， and ask yourself， what are some of the things。

 I say when I'm in that state， what are some of the things， I just do when I'm in that state。

 write them down， okay， and then kind of categorize those things。

 and you'll kind of see the patterns， for me， I know exactly what my type of humor is。

 I like you know， stretching things out， making them a little awkward， that's my humor， I guess what。

 now I saw the pattern， whenever the girl's talking， instead of being like。

 oh how can I get the girl， my how can I use this， and stretch it， here's new material to play with。

 here's new clay to mold something out of， no matter what she says， I can stretch it， that's it。

 and then I just kind of go with the flow， and it's like， here's new material， let's see how。

 let's see how it goes， it's dumb as that， and there's all these little plot lines。

 you can come up with， just for the fun of it， but that's because I find it funny， for you it's like。

 what do you find funny， you know， and do this with girls， do this with your wings。

 do it with yourself， and then， you know， and then girls do this， do it with your wings。

 do it with yourself， any inside joke you have， the better， that's also good way of opening。

 it's not， hey， it's check this out， that's the best open， hey， check this out。

 hey check out this fun we're having， hey check out this fun I'm having， you know。

 and it could be dumbed things， you know， like fuck， like， last night， what was it， hot。

 you guys were in set，你如果拾地Miss，也有一点，他有一个情况，一下，改思，有个 Craven，你们两个口气，是的， Rules，什么，她为什么要逃跑，来，跟时辩，你我说。

她在这个口气，然后你发现，加上什么，如果她们在蒙古，泽河，你可能不乱，然后说，怎么来，我们，就會位置3次被關的，然後你可以繼續控制，鐵馬，是，然後就可以報告，然後你封要，救人，我就說，傻傻，那你就知道。

佳女，他就把我的眼在打，那沒關係，她會這樣，它嚇我，他會ik，因為我進去就是， check this out， Here's some fun。

 and do I really care about her answer， if she eats the shit or not， No。

 it's the ones in like giving that vibe， Any kind of check this out vibe awesome。

 That's why you maybe had it with your friends， You know like a lot of naturals do this。

 They kind of joke around with each other， and they're like hey， good to go to the girl。

 Check this out， We're already having fun， Check this out， Okay， You generate it， you share it。

 and you need to learn how to generate it， You can't just be taking， taking， taking， taking。

 and it also means if you're out with a wing， you better know how to generate fun between each other。

 If you guys are just there like okay where's the girl man， Where's the girl？， Good luck。

 It has to be coming from giving not taking。
