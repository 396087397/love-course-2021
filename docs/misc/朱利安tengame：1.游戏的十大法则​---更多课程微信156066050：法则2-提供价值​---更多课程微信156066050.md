我們再次再次來 mirts，舔0，這塊子美 protected，寒暖的擁有機， agencies raise藥，夜櫻外，暫時打地，不見，根據廣告，你的主意相企 influencers，當作這個為難的。

 boys， 因為你也沒有，不好意思，他們討論， 每氣不明，講RyuPah好好出一拿，很多人討論他，舊幾的會計的是，可能你還是，20幾年的，對啊， 但是，可能他才擔心， positives。

為什麼你會在這裏，我們要來做，西文書， 為您講，中文話要你取消，這是幾個， trick，因為我說，從甚麼部分，再乎，是因為，所以，嘿， class them for 100 bucks。

Don't fuck up， don't fuck up， See me stressed， hey， go give that person a 100 bucks，Don't fuck up。

 go give it to them，啊， it's a lot smoother， a lot easier， you're out of your own way，ok。

 and this is also kind of linked to that competitive versus collaborative vibe。

 every time you're trying to take your stifled，ok， um。。。，你做什麼？， stand up front，ok， how you feeling？。

 sick，so， let's get into this taking giving， if you want to test it。

 you probably saw maybe some of this in the previous of the Tyler hot seat。

 see if you can do a yell as loud as you can go， Anything specific I should know？，ok， I'm done， now。

 notice that， well that's the key， where's。。。ok， so let's just break this down， and by the way。

 everyone falls into this， I still do occasionally too， but notice where your mind goes。

 might yell something， where's it， ok， what should I yell？， what's a good thing to yell？。

 how would I look if I yelled this versus this？， suddenly you're trying to take， it's very subtle。

 if you weren't trying to take and it's like， hey， give them a yell， you wouldn't even think。

 you'd be like， what？ like that， but now you're trying to take a， hmm， would be a cool yell。

 how would I look？， yell， what's up？， now， is that the loudest you could yell？。

 I could like lower my tone and let's go up high and low， like， what's up？， even more。

 Donald Trump for president， Donald Trump， let's all yell together。

 I won't say Donald Trump for president， let's yell something cheesy like， I can do it， I can do it。

 all at the same time together， and then， everyone stops and then you do it a second time， ok。

 everyone， loud as you can， I can do it， one， two， three， I can do it， I can do it， good。

 now that was louder than his first try， why？， because you're part of the group。

 it's now collaborative， you're no longer a crowd， a separate entity you're trying to win over or you're trying to impress。

 subtle， you can also call it being part of the herd， as soon as you're part of the herd。

 it's very easy， and that's what fucks you sometimes when you're out with a girl。

 or when you're out even doing pickup， you're like， oh， I'm on the outside of the herd doing pickup。

 ooh， I'm on the outside of the herd trying to get this girl， it's very hard versus， hey。

 there's the girl， she's on the same team， we're all on the same team， we're all together。

 it's win-win， it's no longer this obstacle or the big boss to beat at the end of a video game。

 another thing you want to write down， I mentioned this on bootcamp is。

 the best way to open is to skip the open， the best way to open is to skip the open。

 imagine you're already open to her and act accordingly， you're already in there。

 she already loves you， you're already open， you're already part of the same crew， hey。

 how's it going， you check this out， I do this all the time， girl walks by and says， hello。

 I was like， hey， so this is my friend， is if I already talk to her， is if I knew her。

 I skip the open， assuming a lot of familiarity is big， okay。

 and reminding yourself that people are not the enemy， that's interesting， people are not the enemy。

 I experience this too， and I first started public speaking， I'm like， here's the crowd。

 I got to win them over， notice that example before， I'm like， I got to prepare my notes。

 I got to win the crowd over， instead of realizing， hey， we're all on the same team here。

 we're all here to learn， have a blast， there's not this me winning them over， me proving my worth。

 me assuming they won't like me unless I do all this， why don't I assume they all like you， you know。

 even here， it's like realizing and being realistic， like， here we all are。

 we're all working on ourselves， everyone's here just like you， why are we not on the same team。

 what does your mind trick you？， so， let's try it again， you all something？， excuse me， hey， hey。

 now try to go as high as you can and I'll go a little louder。

 and you'll also see it's like that permission factor， okay？， ah， ah， even louder， at the same time。

 see， 1，2，3， 1，2，3， ah， ah， ah， bang， Dragon Ball Z， and now it's freeing too， you're like， hey。

 did it once you can do it again， people also experience this when you have to sing or when you have to dance。

 huge cycling， you guys ever get that？ like someone's like， sing。

 and there's like something just fucking blocking you， you know。

 we all get that but as soon as you do it， then you just like hooked on it， you're like。

 oh you did it， nothing bad happened， you keep doing it， okay， we'll go on this， we have a seat。

 and really good shit， alright？， yeah， super good， super good。

 and the key to is kind of remembering that feeling like， it's a lot of game against。

 same as getting out of your own way， it's like， what is it？

 you already have the loudness inside you， the shit blocking you， that's really it。

 you all have this loud personality， you can all fucking， you could literally all rock up here。

 and talk the way I'm talking to the fucking audience， all of you could。

 but there's always shit getting in the way， all of you can walk up and like， rock through a club。

 like， hey， how's it going？ hey， hey， like that， you can all do it。

 there's just shit getting in the way， so in terms of offering value， we'll build on this， okay？

 switch away from what can I take to what can I give， and suddenly as soon as you do that too。

 you'll automatically have fun with all girls， because you're not thinking。

 what can I take from the hot girl that I can't take from the ugly girl， you can give to all girls。

 get turned on by the giving， get turned on by offering value， and that's how you get them。

 you offer so much value they fuck you to thank you， that's what you game， you go up。

 give me some examples of value， the next two ones， good emotions and realness。

 all of these kind of build on themselves， so offering value is big and then two easy ways of offering value。

 is just good emotions， realness and even beyond that make a list。

 what are all the benefits a girl gets from fucking you。

 from the most general ones to even the little， you know， unique ones to you， even petty ones。

 say you're a dude who's making a lot of money， she fucks you， you could treat her to nice dinners。

 just shit like that， there's a benefit， what are some other benefits？， you know， good sex。

 what are some other benefits， that's probably key， we don't， we rarely think of what we can give。

 we're always so focused on what we can take， even in terms of making yourself feel good。

 and we'll talk about this gaming yourself， the reason a lot of guys have trouble actually gaming themselves。

 and have no idea what makes them feel good is you're always so focused on the girl。

 how can I game her， how can I get a good reaction of her， how can I make her laugh？。

 is she investing？， it's like so focused on the girl， they forget about focusing on themselves， okay。

 huge， huge shifts， so one thing you all want to do is make that list， okay， what are the benefits？。

 good emotions， hanging around a cool dude， good sex， if you're into personal development。

 guess what？， that'll probably rub off on her， what does she get out of that？。

 how would that affect her life？， how would that affect her friendships？。

 how would that affect her job？， anything can write down what value is she getting？。

 and once you know that，， it's harder to get guilty or feel sleazy， because that's the other one。

 you're so focused on taking， you're like， who I'm taking all this， what is she getting？。

 I don't know， nothing， yeah， good luck， you're always going to feel guilty in that case。

 if you don't know what she's getting out of it， you feel like you're tricking her out of something。

 it's the same with sales， I talk about this actually， who is at the Julian World Tour？， I did。

 a few of you？， yeah， what I talk about at the end，， or even at the free tour， let's take this free，。

 who is at the free tour Thursday？， I get， so notice that the free tour Thursday。

 and we always do the free tours these ways，， it's like two hours and 45 minutes of pretty much content。

 and at the end there's an upsell on the hot seat，， meaning that's the way it works。。

 now in the past， on my first tour，， what would happen is，， you go up on stage，。

 you kind of get out of your own way，， and those two hours and 45 minutes of sharing content。

 are fucking easy，， because I'm just giving。， there's no， it's like，， oh here。

 here's some more content，， everyone's fucking happy，， and then at the end，。

 those last 15 fucking minutes，， there was always a shift in the vibe，， or even in my mind， I'm like。

， time for the upsell，， shit， they're gonna know I'm upselling them，， oh， it's no longer giving now。

 it's taking。， and I'd kind of rush through it，， I'd talk a little faster，， I'm like， oh， so anyway，。

 there's a hot seat， if you're interested，， yeah， hot seats，。

 and then like we'd finish with an exercise，， exercise， giving， giving， giving，， a hot seat，， okay。

 people experience this。， now what did they say in sales， same thing。。

 write down a fucking list of all the benefits，， someone in the audience， for example，。

 attending a hot seat would get out of it。， write it out， the longer the list，， the fucking better。。

 and when it's time to upsell，， remind yourself of this list，， and remind yourself that you know，。

 if someone comes to a hot seat，， they'll be getting all these benefits。， they don't know that，。

 and it's your job， to do whatever it takes， when they come to get those benefits，。

 so they think you later。， it's your job to lead them to those benefits。， the same with a girl。。

 you walk up，， you know，， she'll get all of these benefits。， no reason to feel guilty，。

 she doesn't know that。， you should feel guilty about not leading her to those benefits。， you know，。

 something to keep in mind，， okay， so knowing what value you're offering，， huge。。

 now apart from that big list，， as I said，， the two next ones are good emotions，， and just realness。。

 yes。， sorry， it's got to go。， can you give us a tips on how do you come up with that list？， because。

， I mean，， I might be thinking too very low of myself，， but there would be something more。

 and there would be different layers of what you bring to the table。， so，。

 any ideas on how to do that better？， I don't know you。， I don't know what value you have to offer。。

 but，， do better，， focus on the next two。， the longer the list is the better，， but otherwise，。

 anyone can offer just good emotions and realness。， which， guess what？。

 are pretty rare in today's world。， those are very valuable。， that's what drives most people。。

 you just want those good emotions。， everyone wants to have more fun，， be more carefree，。

 get excited about something。， offer that。， you offer that，， you'll draw in，。

 she'll fuck you to thank you。， and a little test you can do to kind of see。

 if you're giving or taking，， is walk up to a girl and try to do a silent opener。， just be quiet。。

 and you'll see very fast how they'll react to your vibe。， if there's a taking，。

 she'll just walk the fuck away。， if you're actually giving，， she'll stay and get sucked in。。

 is that saying anything？， who's like？， oh。， okay。， now notice even here，， even without talking。

 I'm giving。， and giving is always in the vibe。， this is huge。， I mentioned this to you last night。。

 even when I'm asking a question，， here's how subtle it gets。。

 and this is why we're going to crack into the footage too。， you can ask a question，。

 and one person can ask it to get a response。， the other could ask the question to offer certain emotions。

 to give。， you can give by asking a question。， what's the difference？， how's it going？。

 trying to take。， how's it going？， here's the fun。， subtle。， whatever I'm doing，， I'm giving， giving。

 giving。， even if I ask for something，， I'm giving in the vibe。。

 are you giving because you're allowing them to basically express themselves？。

 I'm giving because it makes me feel good。， I'm giving because it gets me out of my own way。。

 and you feel fucking awesome。， it's like Christmas if you're giving it a present or birthday。。

 you give a present。， it always feels better than receiving a present。， by that no two，。

 kind of linking it to say looks and money。， what are the presents you like the most？。

 the more personal ones。， not the expensive ones。， not the well-wrapped presents。。

 not the good looking presents。， the unique ones。， you bring your uniqueness，， you give it back。。

 it's all the same。， the way you frame both the questions，， the way you send it，。

 you're all doing it。， hey， how's it going？， how's it going？， you're trying to get a response。。

 how's it going？， you don't care about the response。， you're just focused on the vibe。。

 the words are just vehicles to convey those good emotions。
