任性，所以， what ends up happening is， the anxiety is relieved by approaching，所以， it's a fun process。

 willpower is a capped out thing， you can't just have amazing willpower， it just doesn't work， right？

， it's just too hard to have willpower in every part of your life。

 that's why you have to create positive habits， that's why you have to create situations in place。

 that are processes， so that you'll get your 9 or 10。

 without you having to muster up the courage each time， and have the willpower to see what happens。

 make sense？， cool cool， next thing is this， the only way to get your 9 or 10。

 or the classic 9 or 10， is through social circle game， period， the quicker you just admit it。

 even if you're like， you know， I just don't like this whole social thing， just admit that。

 and then we can move forward with it， now when I say social circle game， it doesn't mean a weekly。

 monthly long-term process， it's the biggest myth I hear about social circle game。

 I've never met a guy who's good at cold approach， and doesn't have a good social circle， ever。

 that's not a sociopath or a jail or something， like， like how it's impossible。

 because if you're good at cold approach， guess what you've built up in the process。

 some social skills， okay， so if you've built up social skills。

 guess what's going to happen eventually， you're going to have this wave of friends。

 and people around you， that's just going to happen， there's no such thing as a dude who's like。

 yeah man， I've fucked 300-400 girls， and， I just want to be friends， no。

 then you better contact a lawyer， because I really don't， because it's a little creepy。

 if you've racked up that kind of a lay count， and you don't have a social circle， I'm going to。

 I just， either I don't believe it， or something weird is happening， you understand that？， okay。

 I hate when I walk out of some， bullshit place like， like bungalow or some random place。

 and I see like a bunch of PUA， is being like， hey bro， good to meet you， hurry， what's up。

 it's not because I don't like to meet， you guys， I love it， it's awesome， it's super flattering。

 and it's fun， but I'm like， why， where's your bitch？， like， where's your girl？， like， you know。

 like let's do this， you know what I mean？， like， let's go， like， what do you， what do you， why。

 I mean， I appreciate you coming and putting talking to me， but where is your 9 or 10？。

 where is your girl that you're super stoked， and excited and happy to be with？， you wanna。

 you wanna， I hate when guys， at least 20% of the guys that come into my program。

 we do orientation on Sundays， where we， it's like a deep dive into the，。

 into the guys' personalities， so that we can profile them， and increase the results， right？。

 at least 20% say that the biggest weakness， is state building， and I'm， like， I mean。

 the little bit， you guys know about me now， I mean。

 you can clearly tell how I'm gonna answer that question， sometimes I walk out， no。

 sometimes I just walk out of the room， because then you take a fucking breath， or a breather。

 or I'll go and play some ping pong， we have a ping pong table in the office， I'm just。

 I'm not good at it， so I'm just like beating the shit out of it， right？， I'm like bro。

 state building， what are you talking about？， how about you go for 9's and 10's。

 how about your weaknesses that you're not doing 9 or 10 game？。

 if right now you walk out of this room， and， I mean， hopefully not right now。

 you walk out this room at the end of the program， and you say 9 and 10 game。

 that's my weakness and that's what my drive is， and that's my motivator。

 suddenly your state will go through the roof， you might have lapses in that。

 you might have girls who kind of reject you， you might have， I mean， you're gonna have。

 negative situations that happen， we all do， but think about how much more motivator you're gonna be。

 when you're actually going after the girl， that you're super satisfied with， instead of， like。

 climbing the ranks， and kind of being okay with it， right， you have to stack the deck in your favor。

 right， the house always wins， meaning if you realize that you don't need to go after。

 what you consider like average girls， or girls that aren't the type of quality， that you're into。

 games should be about punching above your weight， it's like the biggest asterisk。

 if you're writing things down， that you should think about。

 games should be about punching above your weight， why learn this stuff。

 if you're not hitting on girls， and attracting girls that are hotter than you are。

 that to me is the most amazing thing in the world， they have a high ADQ。

 attractiveness differential quotient， ADQ attractiveness differential quotient。

 this Asian girl I picked up on a plane came up with that， and I was like， that's awesome。

 and then I picked her up on a plane， I mean I'm in planes when I'm in nightclubs， so it's my spot。

 attractiveness differential quotient， your Asians I'm sure you'll get that real quick。

 I'm sure you'll get that real quick， exactly， so that's the impressive thing。

 let's say you got like a sick beard， you got like some ripped jeans。

 you got some like orange shoes on， you got like a little fedora。

 you got that whole actor thing going for you， well you shouldn't be picking up like frumpy chicks。

 that are okay at the Hudson， you know what I mean？， like what are you doing？， fuck that shit。

 actually go to some of you guys are not even going to places， where your 9 or 10 even exists。

 where she's not even there， raise your hand for you the most the average place you go to。

 they're just the classic 9 or 10， or your 9 or 10 just isn't even there really。

 there might be one but it's not full of it， raise your hand for it is not full of it。

 okay so right there right， and there's some liars that there as well， but that's crazy。

 how are you not even stepping foot into the place， where your 9 or 10 could be。

 doesn't that sound a little odd， how are you stack。

 you always in game think about how do you stack the deck in your favor。

 there's a reason why casinos are so big and grandiose， right？。

 even if you make a ton of money and gambling， I have a couple of friends that like make their whole living off gambling。

 it's like cool but you are the outlier， because those casinos are huge and beautiful， right？

 because they stack the deck in their favor， the house always wins。

 treat your life like you are that house， that you are deserving of always winning。

 you don't have to go after subpar girls anymore， you can just go after the girls that are precisely your type。

 is that more advanced or is it just straight out？， we are giving it。

 that's some straight up shit bro， right up， look because here's the thing。

 how many of you guys thought that， and again I'm slightly biasing the thing right。

 how many of you guys think that， or have thought in the past even a fleeting thought。

 that you just want to kind of get some mindset stuff。

 and you kind of want to get like your own personal stuff handled。

 and then eventually you'll get the exact type of girl that you're after。

 and eventually you'll get the 9 or 10， right？， like honestly， like that is exactly why。

 I don't really get paid for it today or yesterday。

 like I mean hopefully it helps me long term I guess， like business wise。

 but I'm purely doing like yesterday and today， just I mean yeah there's like probably 50% of it is like my brand。

 or whatever you want to call it right？， but the rest of it is like to talk to you guys。

 but the rest of it is purely because of the fact that， raise your hands again。

 put your hands up a second ago， that is exactly why I'm giving this talk today。

 the fact that you guys thought that at one point in time。

 in the future you can go after your 9 or 10， your exact type of girl that you're after。

 that is flabbergasting to me， that's crazy， you guys need to realize that you might not deserve that girl now。

 but you do deserve her at some point， do you understand？， you don't deserve her now maybe。

 maybe a couple of you probably deserve her now， but not all of you。

 not all of you guys that raise your hands deserve her now， that being said。

 you can deserve her in the next couple days， the next week by just changing what you're doing。

 and realizing that the question that you just asked， well it isn't a fact of good question。

 the answer to that is 100%， the fact that it's straight up。

 it's not that this is some advanced verbose concept， in the clouds。

 you can just put your feet on the ground， and actually go after those 9s and 10s。

 and live that lifestyle， do you follow？， that's good， that's what I say。

 you can borrow confidence from your future self in a way， you're knowing you're walking the path。

 borrow the confidence， you can until you take weeks and that's also。

 I 100% agree with that statement， and it's also 100% think it's a marking horse shit。

 because how long is that path， it's a clever way to be like it's like the 7 Ninja tricks。

 to do whatever， the path thing you got to be really careful on。

 it's also some spiritual mumbo jumbo too， I 100% agree with it。

 but you got to be careful to get out of the mumbo jumbo area， because words like path。

 it's such a good marketing word， because where's the completion， where's the end。

 it's like the chiropractor who's like， not Arthur， he's amazing， it's like other chiropractors。

 who are like， no， in the future， we'll get you fixed once we're on， the 3700 a week continuity。

 but today for the next month we're going to consult， to really get in your mindset。

 no fucker fix my back， I don't need your consult fix my back， you know what I mean。

 and if we do need the consult you can talk， well you fix my back。

 I would rather pay for the 3700 weeks up front， and then I'll get it， let's start the scam now。

 I get it it's a monthly thing， I'm to fix it， but I'm before you， I chiropractors who are like。

 I'd see them for two or three sessions， and they literally don't touch me， and I'm like。

 what are you doing？， like at some， like I get it， you know it's a whole business。

 whatever you got to do the monthly thing， and to fix something， it's monthly。

 but let's start it now， let's not start it in several weeks， right， so this whole path concept。

 right， the path is this， you don't need to go， one of my students in San Francisco。

 described it very well， I do a lot of Skype coaching， well， I do 15 hours a week of Skype coaching。

 and it's crazy， he described this path， where it's most， personal development。

 and most traditional ways of learning game， it's like this big circular path。

 then eventually come to， where you're going to get results， but it's this path of， entitlement of。

 bettering yourself， it's very you focused， do you guys understand that？， the stuff that I teach。

 the real 9 or 10 game， has got nothing to do with you， don't change a， fucking thing about yourself。

 unless there's some obvious things to fix， I don't care what your mindset is at all。

 you can be the most pessimistic， weirdo ever， just do these things。

 watch the fact that you're now getting 9s and 10s， and then how quickly do you think your mindset。

 will just kind of shift into place， does that make sense？， cool， you don't the path。

 can be much shorter path than a roundabout， it can be extremely short， so it all come， yeah。

 comes down to this， if you fix your mindset， and you fix your confidence， you fix all that stuff。

 of course you're going to track harder girls， when only comes in later。

 he's going to give you amazing stuff， talk about presence and energy。

 and he's the best guy in the world to teach you that kind of thing， but that's to better you。

 that's to make you a better person， that's to make you a better candidate。

 for the girl that you do meet， I'm going to show you how you can stay a shitty person， yeah， yeah。

 alright， yeah you don't have to change shit， because there's just certain。

 like I don't think outer game is better than inner game， long term I think inner game is better。

 but I'll tell you what， hold on， I'll tell you what this。

 inner game I think is better than outer game， but I'm just not going to be motivated enough。

 by the inner game results， the day by day basis， to keep going， to eventually get the results。

 that I can do with a few little outer game things。

 it's like you last night you fucked that girl right， yeah， the bitch learned you Arthur was。

 little Arthur， huh， there you go， you fucked that zebra， yeah you fucked the girl my snap。

 and it was only because I put them on my snap， he didn't do anything right it was only because I put her on my snap。

 yeah， I made your bitch my snap queen， I snap cuckolded you， I thought that was funny， thank you。

 so it's just going to this out right， he doesn't have the greatest inner game。

 right it's when you agree that past like what， from your words past month or two or three。

 you've kind of had some of the， biggest inner game struggles you probably had in a while， for sure。

 even last night like were you super happy after all of your approaches and。

 I mean each one I would see your face you were kind of dejected a little bit。

 and I think that's probably a kind of you know， the little bit that I know you now it's kind of an average club experience。

 I don't rarely see you in the club where you're just like。

 fuck yeah let's get lit let's party let's open hey nothing matters。

 it's like one of the gym for being honestly， it's super comfortable you see it in your face。

 yeah I mean I mean okay we how many can relate to that。

 I mean that's really I mean I can relate to that at some point right。

 that it can be uncomfortable not all the time but some I mean。

 I think we'd be lying if we said every time you go to a nightclub we're just。

 super comfortable I'm like once in a while we feel that way right， but what is it go what is it。

 you're a perfect example and I would say she's a nine or ten。

 but I would say she was extremely hotter than average。

 I think she was pretty hot I think she was a very solid。

 eight to a lot of your guys as nine like she was definitely。

 a very attractive girl and there was it didn't go easily。

 right you tried to pull a couple times I would say you failed。

 several times in the set where a lot of guys would just stop。

 but yeah I would consider a solid nine actually especially like an L。A。9 for sure， like a solid L。A。

9 anybody say anybody see her on the snap， she was dope she was dope you guys I mean how many saw the snap right she's pretty hot。

 hey sorry person she was hot right， oh who's not her in person raise your hand。

 you all could have fucked her， right seriously you all could have。

 I was shooting for a man that he's like， did you open I was like oh I lost it man。

 yeah that's because he bought those little blueprint， so he beat you。

 kidding it's not out yet I'm kidding good job though。

 actually he didn't even watch his hands yet so you kind of touched， there a little bit。

 it's really fun it's really indicative by the way of somebody's personality based on the way they dismissive。

 wink you know the dismissive wanky motion， like some some people are just like this fucking shit some people are just like。

 it's like how mad at the world are you is like how little you make the dick。

 it's so funny words of a gay or very content happy person you're just like。

 hey whereas he's just like， it's like a wh- is it like a one ropper， okay is it like a 19 ropper。

 alright so back this right so okay so let's say it。

 the girl that Arthur fucked last night solid nine， not a ten but a solid nine give me a hand。

 I thought he was gonna curtsy for a second right now。

 how much better do you feel about yourself and your confidence。

 at least a couple hours to a day after you had sex with her compared if you didn't fuck her and failed。

 great， could you feel that great by telling yourself how awesome you are。

 by looking at the mirror and saying you know what I'm gonna conquer today I deserve it。

 but you didn't fuck her and you sit a little say those things。

 would you feel just as confident and good？， of course not because it's a horse shit。

 it's a horse shit there's no way you're gonna feel as good。

 because that's not you know a good solid eight and a half inches deep inside of her， here we go。

 there you go， hey hey I'm three inches around， there you go no there you go hey there you go。

 so great job Arthur seriously really good job， because my first met you did you were like borderline depressed about your successful women。

 you were just like fuck you to the point where you're just like I have no like。

 did you get let me know can you quick give it like a half a sentence thing about your。

 your work situation with how we， okay I say it real good super simply， sure。

 yeah like you you basically had such uncaliburated game you got fired because of your game。

 like that's that's intense to like lose your income source over game how good do you think that's。

 gonna impact your confidence level， besides it's gonna go down， what。

 Arthur he's owning my chiropractor， so it's like so he comes all of our stuff and chiropractor thing yeah yeah。

 I had him come to Vegas he stayed in one of my apartments he was in a very like very brief。

 version of Vegas immersion what's that， thank you yeah and it was a short version of it too you didn't even get to experience the full thing so。

 yeah I mean anytime you want to come I mean I have。

 you know that that room in that other apartment I have is all yours and actually start。

 actually we're first I'm relaunching immersion in a way where everyone can live with me which is kind of cool。

 yeah yeah that changes everything right it's cool， yeah I mean it's it's cheaper than bootcamp so。

 yeah it's pretty it's pretty sweet because the reason everyone got such such results before I was with RSD。

 and the reason I even had a business before RSD is everyone lived with me and it was a year long program。

 you had to commit to but the average stay was two and a half years。

 I eventually got to point where I'm just like why aren't you guys leaving him what's happening。

 like like it was it was crazy it was it was wild， I paid 3500 a month for this 19 like 17 19 bedroom house。

 there's like 11，000 square feet， it was it was crazy it was it was amazing we just crushed it so now I'm I'm bringing all those concepts。

 that I did during that into my current Vegas immersion we're gonna just absolutely crush it。

 I have a rule like my guys can't hook up with girls that aren't eight nine or tens unless they hook up with the girl。

 in like an ice room or in inside the casino inside the hotel。

 if it's like an in venue lay a girl you sleep with like in the same venue that you met her in。

 then you can fuck anything you want but if you pull her back to your place sounds so horrible。

 but then if you pull her back to your place you actually have to fuck a girl who's eight nine ten。

 you know very attractive quality girl because I only like guys game in an area where even if they had。

 even if you had an average level game you would only be able to talk to girls that are minimum eight。

 right and that's really kind of the next key to nine and ten game。

 it's your only even if you are only allow yourself to meet an approach nine and tens。

 and you never improved who in here is not a virgin raise your hand。

 not a virgin okay cool cool not a virgin， okay who in here who in here has felt the form desires of okay if you're not a virgin right。

 you have to understand this right I have this thing where if you just take sweet。

 let's see this thing is this you can just go straight after the nine and tens。

 hold up yeah hold up as I do you can just go after the nine and tens you don't have to treat all girls equally。

 right I don't mean you treat them poorly but you don't have to treat them all equally you can put categories in your life。

 of girls that you're friendly with girls even that you're flirty with even girls you make sexual jokes with。

 that you don't actually penetrate that you don't actually get a boner for。

 and then there's girls that you do right you just don't have to keep building it upward and upward。

 you can just go after it if you're always picking venues if you're always picking the place that you're attracting women in。

 and in the minimum girl there is an eight nine or ten but you have the current level of game that you have。

 as long as you're not a virgin and you've at least had sex with one girl right you at least know how to do that at least one or two times。

 then what's going to happen in that place with the current level of game that you have when you do have success。

 it's going to elevate your game and the minimum girl is going to be what an eight nine or ten。

 you understand just because you've chosen that place it it kills you when I see guys that are just like really good with game。

 and they're going to these like dive bars or Hudson or whatever the fuck it is I'm like what are you going to this horror。

 like these what are you going to these places for when your game is actually fairly decent。

 like let's say you are a ten level game but you're going to places that have a maximum seven level girl。

 what's the best that you can get okay and let's say that you have a five。

 five is the median right you have a five level game but you're going to places with eight or above。

 what what's you might not have sex all the time because your game is a five but what are the girls quality level that what what is that quality level going to be in those venues。

 a minimum of eight this is so simple to me that's all you have to do and now suddenly you have eight nine and ten game。

 fuck it it's just some simple adjustments to the puzzle that you throw together right if I had a little more time。

 I was like really rail into eight nine and ten game properly with how you would do this but what's that。

 so I like these are real yeah I actually use that word as much as possible right you guys good of course it's in the bag。

 um no I'm 90% sure you know I have no idea I might I probably didn't bring it actually I probably just brought it to the laptop。

 why are the max dead shit don't pull out the deal though fuck the bump lugs they those in there the anal beads。

 shit he turned it on thanks so go for it for sure。

 you guys see the preview video of the you army on my on my youtube you can see that that was like the walking with the。

 blog you all right you saw that the you army yeah the one of the most successful guys that I know is a personal coaching。

 I just worked with him in New York for was it two or three days and the dude super successful and the to the point where I actually。

 have to like try to give him extra game hours because as we're as we're talking about game he's giving me crazy like life。

 and business advice and I'm just like this is not like you're paying me to coach you I'm holding on stop talking。

 I love everything you're saying but let me keep coaching you game stuff because it's just I feel like the balance exchange is。

 weird because he's helping me non stop and the whole time I'm just like you give me give you game advice like I。

 will be the craziest shit let's just just chill out for a second the thing that you told me is the laziest people are the most successful。

 people the laziest people are the most successful because I have a whole I've a whole video that I'm putting on this right real。

 nine and ten game is being lazy because you create the you army I would hook up with a new nine right now I'm really。

 business focused so probably two nines a month to be super fair and honest with you guys and then a couple。

 sevens and eights throughout the month I probably sleep like you know on a bad month like six new girls。

 that's like a pretty like shitty month but only probably you know currently only about two of those are。

 nines or above you know the other ones are kind of just like you know average but really fun girls I'm still。

 doing two that are kind of my type and the thing about this is that create the you army in such a way。

 where I'm lazy the laziest people are the smartest people and you know why they learn to use leverage。

 the laziest people are the people that the stupidest thing you could do if you're in business right。

 let's say you're anybody to tech maybe a program or anything like that the stupidest thing you could do is quit your。

 job to then open your own tech shop and be your own employee and not hire tech people to understand。

 because then all now you're your own HR department you're your own secretary anybody do that when they。

 that maybe you're a lawyer and accountant it kills me I see in being law like lawyers or anything in。

 being here no let's say you're a lawyer and accountant it's a good example right or your software。

 programmer and then you decide you know you graduate you're like I want to open up my own tech shop。

 I want to open up my own freelance business right and then you realize that wait I'm my own。

 secretary I'm my own administrative assistant I am my own you know HR I'm my own sales team。

 and then all of a sudden you're like wait this is just now now this 40-hour week job that I had before。

 turned into this 80-hour week entrepreneurial effort like it's not it's not actually creating processes。

 whereas if you're lazy the most successful guy that I know that I'm close with。

 owns a bunch of rehabs okay I lived with him in San Francisco for a year he did my old year。

 long immersion right and the dude literally went for making $2，500 a month to making。

 a hundred thousand dollars a month within about three four months he credits it all to。

 this one book I think that's a little bit far fetched not at all I wish because I read that book。

 and I didn't make that jump it's called Transurfing maybe we'd Transurfing it's a Russian book。

 there's an English translation so Transurfing as part of my product and part of just。

 like my I'm trying to make my YouTube a little bit more like conversation between me。

 and the people watching it I'm gonna start doing some book review type stuff and I'm gonna。

 heavily review that one I'm it's by far the best inner game book in the world。

 it takes the stuff that's in the secret and just explodes upon it and makes even。

 if you're like oh the secret that's kind of neat that's a little bit weird Transurfing will make you a。

 complete believer in all this stuff it's crazy he credits the entire amount of his success just。

 reading that book right aggressive quantum physics yeah but like quantum physics。

 sounds like okay quantum physics all right fucking clear your shockers I get it。

 but quantum quantum physics is like the book makes it so crazy practical to your life。

 that after you there's six volumes after we'd each volume you're just like。

 holy sh like I've never read a book that and I've even got through all six because。

 it's so dense I've only only made it even through four volumes but every time I do it。

 I'm just like the world isn't the same but I'm think the world isn't the same。

 in like a weird woo way I'm like no shit is different than I ever thought。

 it's the book is amazing anyway this guy credits the entire success with that。

 and now he's doing like six seven hundred thousand a month you know on an average。

 month but the point of me saying this is he has no idea what rehabilitation is。

 he has no idea how to like help people get over drug it's a drug addiction。

 place right he's not a therapist he never he doesn't have a college degree。

 he's got no idea the fuck he's talking about but his program is one of the most。

 highly rated programs in all of Silicon Valley， I think you can grow rich。

 I don't know if someone has grown rich he has a steel meal company， but has nothing like that。

 read thinking grow rich based on his recommendation， Transurfing， TR ANSUR FING。

 six volumes I believe the author is Vadim something。

 Transurfing I mean you could literally spell it anyway I feel like Google， correct it TR ANSUR FING。

 I'm in the process of creating my own illegal audio version of it me speaking。

 that could give to people I'm going to try to contact him he's very elusive， go for it。

 and I want to get to I'm going to finish his question but is it related to this or can you hold on。

 I'll go for it yeah yeah go for it that's fine， ask and it is given ask and it is given。

 that's his recommendation， ask and it is given I like this not so the you army is how I take the concepts and。

 Transurfing and I apply it to a way that I can actually get real tangible results。

 I love the secret the problem is people will read the secret they'll read thinking grow rich。

 and then sit at home and jerk off and they're like I'm manifesting this shit。

 you're manifesting like a bunion like what are you manifesting like relaxed。

 what are you you're manifesting nothing right how much you go manifest some actual pussy or something。

 right so I mean the guy literally says the only difference he made he was making $2500。

 a month as a bank teller like a member of service representative and then all of a sudden。

 he decided to read this book he read the book immediately he started this rehab。

 he had no he was not a therapist so and he had no rehab clients。

 he literally just parlayed it in value arbitrage right value arbitrage is a big concept。

 I talk about where you have a lot of value he's got a lot of value you don't know each other。

 I introduce you I'm the middleman and I get an exponential effect even one of the two of you。

 because I just made the introduction I get it bestowed upon me right。

 it's like all the stuff we talk about yesterday with the money thing right。

 some guy asked oh you know is it is a financial thing like if you don't have a lot of money。

 for the bottles like how do you do it or enough money to do big dinners for groups of people。

 how do you do it well I don't have them I don't have 13，000 hours a day。

 I can spend on bottles right but I still have 13 grand a day worth of bottles。

 right so the point is you just you leverage all this stuff into a cascaded effect。

 so the reason why the you army is so important is because you don't have to do it all。

 they take you under their wing that you create a situation where people are excited。

 and invested into your success the more invested it attract。

 attract if you had to define something right attraction equals what what would you guys say it is。

 value self-entitling what would you what what's your definition of attraction。

 some reason what what is attraction what is it value what else self confidence what else。

 looks what else the guy in the back of his head nodded back what is it。

 what's the attraction to you yeah yeah that's pretty good right in terms of the。

 you that you can use attraction equals investment period the more investment。

 you have from the other person the more attraction you're going to have all。

 of your games should purely come down to how much investment and participation。

 and buy in can you get from the other person that's in business and with women。

 right that's why like when Owen talks about having these like super long videos。

 well a lot of people like why don't you have those quick three five minute videos。

 right my friend of mine's got a 1。4 1。7 million YouTube subscribers。

 alpha m I don't know if you guys have seen it， he's on Shark Tank he looked terrible on Shark Tank but he's actually a really cool guy。

 great advice his videos are like three to five minutes with like a fucking。

 not our awesome cameras like just like a little camera whatever right。

 the only YouTube channel clap and correct correct。

 I think it lives in Chicago but I think he is from Atlanta his office is in Chicago。

 that's how I know anyway the point is this right you create you create this。

 leverage you have to create the leverage using let's go back to the army I'm。

 going to touch on the LFM guy a little bit later you create this leverage in your。

 life because people are invested into your success once you once you realize。

 that people are excited about I borderline like 50 like 49% of me would。

 rather get you laid than me right 51% probably me but I would rather get。

 you like I'd rather get you laid than the random person walking on the street。

 right because I it fulfills me to be honest it gets me super excited to help。

 you out right it's it's kind of even a selfish reason like just makes me。

 feel good it's like oh I like like him getting like I might be happy about him。

 being laid than him probably not but maybe right because I had like a。

 something to do with it right I kept throwing this said it was like a。

 little you know me and Alfonso had as much to do with it as I did like we。

 you know we were like working really hard for that to happen for him so I'm。

 stoked about it because I'm invested in his success you follow so when you。

 create the when you create the you army you're getting these 9s and 10s。

 without you actually doing all of the effort in the work the hottest girls。

 I've ever hooked up with were because I did very little it was sometimes。

 because the people that were introduced me those 9s and 10s told me hey。

 shut the fuck up just stand there just shut up bro right because I want to do all。

 the jokes and all the stuff and they were like no no no it's done keep it。

 going because I create the you are me and the way that I create the you army is。

 every person that's in my life I tell them exactly I mean you you guys all。

 already know what type of girl I like right because it's what the lead in that I。

 talk about I make it extremely clear to put out of these like funny one。

 liners what I like well I hook up with other girls of course why make。

 other girls of course but my rubric of the type of girl that I'm into what。

 my 9 or 10 is is extremely specific right the brown I'm down you know I want。

 to cook a colo bottle right I want to I want to girl who's like I want I want。

 I'm then I'm going to take a you want Shumpert's girl like I'm totally。

 going to take his girl you know I'm on Shumpert's girl。

 huh holy shit right yeah you know yeah yeah I'm totally I'm not kidding like。

 I mean me and him are already Eskimo brothers and Eskimo brothers means you've。

 both been in the same hole so I'm not kidding I'm a scale one to 10 she can get it。

 I'm a scale one to 10 I give her one I got it she can she can get the。

 business right so I create this you army well you create in the you army is。

 how I met Dambles Irian create in the you army is how I met Lindsay。

 Pales and how me and Lindsay Pales are you know you guys were with Lindsay。

 Pales is I mean I'm a scale one to 10 what is she I mean 10 like she's not。

 my 10 but she's definitely a 10 I mean her of an app coming out soon you guys。

 who cleats and cleavages yeah region of you who cleats and cleavages。

 cool I mean that's probably in the top five hottest girls ever fucked for sure。

 I mean cleats and cleavage to me like ava is her real name like that I mean I。

 pounded out at a Dambles Irian's house omit the whole thing yeah cool thing。

 I have it all on infield to just I can't just you I can't just can't use the。

 footage because there's too much shit happening but she's probably the top five。

 girls that are in sex with I love that girl like she's amazing super super。

 cool so good but I did nothing to fuck her I literally did you army。

 techniques in order to get into Dan's house once I was there I just kept。

 my mouth shut and made sure I stood next to her for as long as possible。

 and then oh oops I fell into her well I was a little tired by the today I fell。

 I fell on my back and then she fell on top of me but。

 are you literally like in a conversation with Dan like you describe her。

 think are you like I need that next time she comes to when he gets it up。

 is that what she is not in this case but yes that does happen right here's the thing。

 yeah I was talking with you about the friends like guys who are critical of。

 pick up I laugh at the end be here have friends who are a little bit you've。

 talked talk them about pick up and they're a little bit critical of it or think。

 it's weird I mean anything okay they can all go to hell because not only。

 like no I don't I so don't have time for friends who are critical of pick up。

 because that means you're critical of me so you do fuck yourself like。

 here's I mean I you're gone like you I'll block your number you're you're。

 out of my life like I don't have time for it I'm I my hopes goals and。

 ambitions are bigger than me or that person so if you if if that's how。

 little you respect my friendship that you're gonna be critical of like I。

 want not only do I not want you to be critical of what of this but I want。

 you to be sackedively seeking out 9s and 10s for me that are my type that。

 is my you army so that the start of it is first time I ever met Dan I'm。

 like yo hey where's his spanner girls at right you have a break was for me。

 break what means a Puerto Rican I was like yeah a Puerto Rican for me I was。

 like go shoot pop was that though where's that what eat a посetta it means。

 a beautiful pussy in Spanish a go shoot pop was that it means I want to suck。

 a lot of your pussy right now and then I'm like he didn't know that meant。

 but I knew there's a Brazilian girl next to him so she just starts like。

 laughing her ass off which then made Dan think I was cool because he's。

 like oh you did it's like the third thing I know in Portuguese like I know。

 like five things total like it's I don't know it I'll just but like that's a。

 good thing to know it kind of you can I can repeat it over and over again so。

 that girl was a absolute nine or 10 this wasn't the the famous celebrity that。

 I fucked it was the just some random hot girl and the the entire time was。

 crazy they're just I made her laugh he thought that was funny but it。

 reinforced the type of girl that I'm into he will literally text me randomly。

 the last text he sent me was last night about stem cell injecting stem。

 cell there's something but the text before that was hey I got a couple。

 brown girls on the boat are you in Vegas and I was like no man fuck and he's。

 like oh man these would be perfect for you like you might not be able to get。

 a guy like the amblesier needs to say these kinds of things tomorrow but you。

 can get other people in your life that's why you wait your critical of pick up。

 no no not really do I not mean to be critical of pick up right you would not。

 have to like read the game or anything but I want you to be actively put in。

 work for me because if you're my friend I'm gonna do way more than that for。

 you so the you army is essentially a group of people that know exactly what。

 your type is and then are motivated to pursue that it's a lot less。

 difficult once you're able to actually identify what your type is to the。

 closest people that are around you that alone will be the filter because there's。

 gonna be 10% of people that are like why are you telling me this I don't care。

 if they don't even care to hear that they can go fuck themselves seriously。

 like go fuck seriously how many people in your life do you probably have some。

 friends that like because if you know them a while or because of some reason。

 you're still friends with that you're just like man I don't really need this。

 person in my life if I'm really gonna be honest anybody okay 100% of us。

 probably should raise our hands seriously right I mean I still do right I mean。

 this guy's like yes all of them right all can go to hell no so I mean but。

 seriously though right like if you're critical of pick up pick up stupid。

 pick up from what ever that that aside because you're afraid of like a weird。

 Google search of what this means and then acronym whatever it's so much。

 different than that so much bigger than that the point where it's to actually。

 build that you army first step is just test it just tell everyone in your life。

 holy shit that girl is fine she could get it say lines like that because it。

 reframes everybody in your life to know watch your okay studies show that。

 your testosterone will go up just by talking like this despite somebody here。

 is a lot smarter with this kind of thing than I am but just by talking like。

 this more often anybody here have a not necessarily ED but like any sort of。

 sexual performance anxiety or any sort of sexual issues like whatsoever I got。

 all razor anybody I have a problem like the wind blows and like I'm like oh。

 shit fuck go down you know like like because I always talk like this if I。

 realize there's a couple months that goes by where I'm not talking sexual。

 then suddenly I start having those kinds of potential problems but but because。

 of the way that I talk there never a problem so in order to get those。

 nine's and tens the first you have to do is the you army so when you're doing。

 that you army you're literally the first step of that is literally telling。

 people in your life all I'll just ask them I'll be like oh where the。

 brownbush is it and then and then they'll be like what would you just say。

 so if they're a little bit they're either like oh they're over here if they。

 don't say that they're gonna say wait what'd you say like they're slightly。

 offended are they're confused I'll go no you don't understand I don't call。

 them bitches I'm disrespect I just don't know their names individually。

 right which is yeah yeah just add on to what you were saying like how they。

 think like just talking to some other fellow members here they were saying。

 how all people think that we're gonna be weird by doing something like this。

 and you know a judge us I think it's better for us to do this and be able to。

 go what we want as opposed to not knowing why you can't attract and。

 be living that's a phenomenal politically correct way to say it I completely。

 agree I don't have time to be that nice about it I mean I like you guys。

 ever heard higher slow fire fast in terms of business concept why don't we。

 apply that to our friends like sorry our our longevity of how long we know。

 each other is irrelevant the amount of experiences that we've shared which。

 can be indicative of how long we know each other right so there is a little。

 bit of a link to that like what have we done for each other that builds trust。

 length is a facade of trust right I mean I've had people have known for years。

 and years you know kind of fuck me over not like bad or whatever but you know I。

 mean do shit that I'm just like wait we've known for ages what are you doing。

 and then I had to remind myself and I'm like oh we just haven't really done a。

 lot together like time is an irrelevant kind of verbose concept right so I'm。

 creating that you are me the very first thing I'm gonna do is tell everybody in。

 my life shit if they're brown I'm down they're minority in my priority they。

 like I'm white and bright I'm just right and I'm just gonna like go go over。

 and over again right I'm gonna talk about how I'm gonna tell every girl in my。

 life manage I don't understand why you're not like guys will blue eyes and。

 blonde hair the girls check this out the next girl that you hit on the next。

 show you approach who's a nine or 10 look at her and say I don't understand。

 you see opener a couple sentences goes by and tell her I just I just don't。

 understand why don't you like guys with blue eyes and blonde hair like you seem。

 really nice but I don't understand and you have no idea if she likes that。

 or not okay just out of the blue it's it's literally an NLP thing right just。

 out of the blue say that and there's always 100% of time and I don't say。

 blue eyes and blonde hair if that's that's me okay you would say something。

 else okay that just happens to be me right you can say anything about you。

 tall tall dark and handsome or whatever it might be right or why don't you。

 guys like guys are poorly short and got a limp say say something that's。

 either neutral or positive about yourself but be inquisitive be curious I。

 just don't just don't understand anytime you want to appear genuine with a。

 woman especially a very attractive woman nine or 10 instead of trying to be。

 genuine or authentic be surprised and that will convey genuineness if you。

 try to be genuine with somebody what's gonna happen you're trying to be。

 genuine it's not gonna come off as being genuine but if you come off as。

 surprised or inquisitive then you end up looking like you're being genuine。

 or authentic does that make sense sweet so immediately look at her and be。

 like I just don't I just don't understand why don't you guys why don't you。

 like guys with blonde hair and blue eyes what's your problem you don't like。

 guys obviously if you're not white you say something else right and then。

 immediately what do you think the girl says even if she even if she's a。

 snow bunny even if like because most of the girls that I like I like they don't。

 like me like I go to you guys are been a greenhouse or whip anybody greenhouse。

 and whip are like the thuggist clubs in all of New York City it's where a。

 Tony Parker got his eyes scratched with the glass you guys know that a few。

 years ago I was there the night before my goal is to go to a club that it's。

 like so high-end but also so hood that I like a little bit of safety。

 concern that that club had the hottest like like half black half white girls。

 it had the hottest like like Hispanic girls with blonde hair like this。

 just he's like striking music video type girls there are a lot of white。

 girls too but they were all snow bunnies right you know so many is you。

 know what snow bunny is yeah I know you know come on snow bunny is a。

 white girl that likes black guys right I mean it's kind of any girl like。

 black guys but it's specifically a you know snow bunny is it's a white。

 girl like black guys so I'm looking for the the Hispanic version of the。

 snow bunny right anyway the point is that I'm talking I'm like why don't you。

 like white guys you know blue eyes and blonde hair I just don't understand and。

 then immediately what do you think she says no I do not I mean I that would be。

 awesome sometimes usually the girl says I never said that who told you that。

 anytime you do a qualifying statement to a girl even if it's true the girl。

 always resist it and fights it a little bit which creates the cognitive。

 dissonance which then creates the investment a girl is a real nine or 10 you。

 probably won't have enough value you won't have enough entitlement to actually。

 get her the more you muster up it's just not gonna happen you have to do。

 these techniques to get it then once you get it you're gonna end up feeling。

 like Arthur where you know the the boner you used to fuck the girl with last。

 the next day because you fucked the girl that's a solid nine right but there。

 was no there's no inner game anything that he did the inner game stuff that。

 Arthur does helps him just feel better out his life in general for the rest of。

 his life which is amazing but it didn't help him get that girl right he was。

 face even I even though there's my video to him because his face was just。

 frontal just fuck he was like I'm gonna dance with this girl but she's not。

 like me like that's why I videoed him to make fun of him to be like oh。

 but what'd you look like and then even then he smiled a little bit but like。

 even in the video I'm looking I'm like dude that you the fuck up your dance with a。

 hot chick it's crazy right so you're so I tell that girl that she goes wait。

 what I I never said I don't like those those kind of guys who who told you。

 that she starts fighting back with me I go immediately I go your friend right。

 there the friend never said shit but the hotter the girl the more likely I。

 am to be like why don't you like guys who I'll kind of describe myself you。

 know obviously in a good light and then I'll tell and I'll be like yeah your。

 friend just said that I mean it's okay we can be friends you know it's。

 I'm not looking for anything serious and this is after like the third four。

 sentence I'm gonna look at for anything serious is cool we can just be friends。

 but then I've already got her on this path of trying to like figure this。

 thing out of why she isn't like guys like this then actually on this。

 investment path trying to figure out like why the fuck her friend said that。

 even if it might be true maybe she's a snow bunny but at the same time she's。

 still trying to figure out it figured out because I created that kind of。

 distance in her mind you follow cool does it make sense sweet so then she's。

 gonna ask the friend and she's like what the fuck do you say that of course I。

 mean so I'm gonna like blow it up as big as possible so that way the impact。

 is that much larger so I'm gonna and then the she's like why did you just tell。

 him that I don't like white guys who blot as a blonde hair and then she's。

 gonna like wait I never told him that then she's gonna look at me and I go。

 you're gonna lie to me already we're we're gonna get off on that kind of foot。

 and the girls like wait what and then Amelia Graham talking to looks at her。

 friend and goes wait you lied to him right just because she's so wrapped up in。

 the moment this happens almost verbatim about every time and then the girls。

 are like I never lied to him right the friendship yeah yeah which is that's a。

 whole another topic so it's so the friends gonna be like I never lied to him。

 and then I'm I'm just gonna go yeah I mean you never lied to me but I mean let's。

 be serious you did say that though and then the girls like what I said what and I。

 go we're gonna play this game I mean we could we could do this song and dance。

 all night but you know that you said that she doesn't like you know she clearly。

 thinks I'm sexy she clearly think it's she clearly likes me but you know。

 that you just said that she doesn't like guys with blot as a blonde hair like。

 let's just let's move forward at least so we can keep this thing going I never。

 said that why'd you tell him that duh duh duh duh duh duh and the whole time。

 just like and then eventually the girls just like oh you fucking asshole well I。

 can't believe you tried to say that and duh duh duh duh I'm like come here come。

 here you just wrap her up in a hug right and the whole time you get this。

 massive break and report attraction builder because of that whole thing you。

 got it but well it's all happening I'm interweaving the type of girl that I。

 like by disqualifying the girl so the next thing about getting these 9s and。

 10s you have to disqualify the shit out of them disqualify the shit of them who。
