也 Greetings，要去當年，歐岳，俊oo，教训，法，教理，藝觀，所以，懲ig，空，技， must，就是，藷，無聊，部 wonn，方，参，In fact。

 before this somebody who takes place，， we have educational seminars and trainings。。

 Things that allow us to kind of sharpen our skills，， whether it's in sales， marketing，。

 conversational tactics， social skills， publicity，，PR， or whether it's tower。

 having us to share our ideas。， We also do the stuff like this， though， throughout the year。。

 I know tower likes getting people to join in on his adventures，， but Tony Robbins， or Eckhart Toll。。

 And he'll have teams of people within RSD，， go to adventures with these various careers。

 so that they can share stories with each other。， It's always cool meeting those people。

 that you respect the most，， these are the people that tower respects the most。。

 I too personally have gone to those seminars， with those people that I have a lot of respect for。

 in terms of the business world，， the social world， and I do that on a regular basis。

 from people who are famous authors，， the people who are famous just in the business world。

 and general are just celebrities in their own right。， And a lot of it has to deal with us。

 just having the idea of learning more。， But I mean， that just means it's a team building。。

 Other than that， it's just dinners。， Throughout the summit，。

 we'll organize regular dinners for socializing，， catch up on things。。

 And I'll often travel around the world to meet up， with instructors randomly。

 just so we can share dinners together， and catch up on the stories that we might have missed。。

 This is all part of a process，， this is for necessarily for business。。

 The team building process is about building emotional rapport， and building an investment。

 into the emotional bank accounts of each other。， In business， there's always going to be。

 miscommunications， things that happen。， When you have a strong emotional bank account，。

 you're able to survive those things。， If you don't， then you won't。。

 And that's what a team needs to have。， They need to have that strong emotional bank account。

 so that you have that trust， and then you can continue to grow together。

 and travel together and pick up together。， These are all the things that they do。

 so that their team is strong。， Now， because our guys are remote，。

 we have regular month-week remote meetings， where they talk on the phone。

 or sometimes try to do more recently， start to get these things to be organized by a Skype。。

 It's not as ideal as doing it in person though。， That's why we always try to prefer。

 by doing these meetings in person。， But during our calls， we share ideas and tactics。

 on how to make our programs better。， The most innovations， the new marketing and tactics。

 that we've created， they're very， very exciting，， very insightful。。

 You have a phone of some of the most intelligent people。

 from around the world and social development， and personal development，， sharing ideas。

 it's always gonna be a lot of fun。， We also have our business administration team。

 listening in so that they could help fulfill， the needs of the people that are on the call。

 so that whatever they're talking about is actually met。， This allows us to have a queer expectation。

 that things are gonna get done， or a clearer expectation of what things need to get done。

 so that they will get done。， There's always a need to have clearer expectations，。

 whether it's writing it down，， whether it's sharing it in the meetings，。

 whether it's creating a formal legal agreement，， a contract， or just talking it through，。

 which are trusted friends。， In the past， it was all about just trust。。

 Now we're getting more and more into the formal structures， of business。

 we actually have attorneys involved， with most of our queer expectations，， as a protocol。

 procedures， and formalizing due process。， At the same time， we wanna make sure。

 that even though there's a lot of bureaucracy，， it doesn't prevent our main goal of the team，。

 which is empowering the people with the freedom， to succeed， not having those bottlenecks。

 that get in a way of having what we need to have， to be a successful global company。。

 Communication being stifled would be the biggest thing，。

 but making sure that our teams have the authority，， responsibility， control。

 and power to make decisions， is that thing。， The way we could do that is because we have very talented。

 people that we trust， and we've worked with us， for a very， very， very long time， several years，。

 and having that clarity on that team vision，， because we have to view ourselves not just like，。

 I'm that particular instructor that has this particular， attitude， this particular style，。

 if you have that， you're not a team player，， we don't want that， we don't want the people。

 that have that kind of attitude。， We want people who are viewing it in this sense， that， yeah。

 because I'm a part of a team，， I have more power。。

 I could leverage that power to accomplish a higher vision，， have a higher influence。

 make a bigger impact in the world。， As a result， I have a chance to have more opportunities。

 for growth， and I have more opportunities for growth，， and have you asked me to come to my life。。

 These are the kinds of things that we are encouraging， in our team building process。。

 A lot of it comes from the sense that it's based， on rapport in terms of tactical，。

 in terms of like actual things you need to do to be a team，。

 you need to line each other's incentives，， and in terms of our team， they cross-mode each other。。

 They have cross-mode short videos，， and they help each other build the content with each other。。

 Tadder， especially， is good at that。， I help them with building the team's teams，。

 because every team has their own traveling team，， we have our corporate team，。

 and I have a massive repertoire of knowledge， of how to build a successful team。。

 So I contribute on that end，， so that people will have all the resources they need。。

 I also contribute and invest in the growth of their teams，。

 whether it's investing money or just lending 10，000 to 1，000 or more money。

 to particular people's teams and their products， to make sure that's a success。。

 And we've been doing this for the longest of time。， As a result， these teams have grown to be very。

 very strong。， They're no longer the baby tiger。， They're now like the full-grown tiger。

 out there in the jungle，， accomplishing and making things happen to me。。

 And it's not like one tiger took a tribe of them。， They travel all around the world。。

 They just get back together again now， and then to celebrate their victories。。

 I think it's really cool to be able to do that。， I'd rather be a part of a team。

 than be a solo guy anyway。， There's a lot of potential for whether it's Ty or myself。

 or any RC teams to be on their own。， Some people do that because they're not team players。。

 They don't view the power of the team。， They don't have the communication or the corporate culture，。

 or they might have not really fit well， with what our goals and vision are。。

 But those people that are going to be a part of this team， will see that fruit。

 see that strong vision we have， and be able to reach the rewards of it。。

 Because it's always better to have a team that works together， than to do things on their own。。

 It's way more difficult to do things on your own， and really have a really meaningful impact。。

 And that's what we want to have。， Because more importantly than anything else。

 is how that powerful impact in the world。。
