# 朱利安ten game：3.互动练习：练习1-清晰地沟通​---更多课程微信156066050

一开始的一帮会走出来，这个球是不要以释放连摊，卡的，走出来，为什么不去，自己我 MONLA，将其尺寸一下，我们上 Boston，在各种扒位置，是这样的人，OK， this is big。。

 If the girl doesn't hear you， as I mentioned，， yeah， you have your silent opener for a little while。

， After one minute or so，， she's not going to want to fucking 40 minute interaction。

 with the guy she can't hear。， With the guy she's like， what？， What？， What？， OK， number two。

 are you smiling？， If you're not smiling，， like this should happen because you're feeling good。。

 But a lot of guys aren't used to smiling。， When you think you're smiling， you're not。， Right。。

 But you're smiling now。， It's a lot better。， It is a lot better。， Yeah。

 when you think you're smiling， you're not。， And， or you feel good， but you suppress the smile。。

 You're not used to allowing yourself to smile，， which is pretty weird， you know？。

 Or you're not used to allowing yourself to even laugh。， Like exactly， exactly。。

 Like that's the idea。， Everyone should be like that。， Like， ah， yeah。， Like， funny enough。

 I was one of those guys too。， I couldn't laugh。， Like， if I saw a movie with some friends，。

 I was think I was super quiet，， like kind of analyzing， like，， and everyone's like laughing。

 and I just couldn't， you know？， And it's something you have to actually learn。， It's like。

 allow yourself to laugh。， You know， give back and touch with that。。

 If you're a guy who's trouble just laughing in general，， like maybe watch some comedy or something，。

 like get him back and touch with， like，， allowing yourself to smile and express that。， Okay。

 you got to show it。， Number three， eye contact。， Look at her in the eyes。。

 If you're not looking at her in her eyes，， like， why the fuck was she， you know，。

 get sucked into your interaction？， How would you draw her in？， If I'm talking to you guys here。

 and I'm like，， so the big concept is got to look at her in the eyes。， Do you guys all get that？。

 Everyone get that？， You know， you're not gonna be as drawn in。， Building on that too， facing her。。

 If you're like this， so， hey， anyway，， did the entire time， how can she get drawn in？， You go first。

 and then you draw her into that。， Okay， and number five， proximity。， You gotta get in and out。

 get in closer。， If you're too far away，， she's not gonna experience you as intensely。， Okay。

 especially in a loud environment。， It's very different。， Like， if I'm talking， hey， what's up？。

 How's it going？， I'm talking the same volume，， but it's probably a lot more intense now。

 than I'm this close。， You know， it's way more intense， the closer you are。。

 And I'll play with this with Preshon Presharoff。， Well， I'll talk to her girl， and it's literally。

 like a fucking dance。， I'm like， hey， how's it going？， Julian， good to meet you。， Oh， cool， did it。。

 Like， I'm in and out all the time。， As you saw in those videos， I'm never like a statue。， Okay， yes。

， Yeah， like when you say you don't dance with the girls，， but when you're on the C。U。，。

 like you're always like moving around and。。。， Yeah， always in motion。。

 And that's what you do when you're dancing。， In and out。， Yeah。， Now， I'm always in motion，。

 and what it also does is it prevents me， from reacting so much to the environment too，。

 because I'm always generating。， You always want to be doing。， And set out a set。。

 A big mistake guys make is they leave an interaction。， They're like， static。， You're fucked。， Okay。。

 So these are some like five basic requirements，， and funny enough， like you can watch the videos，。

 you understand the concepts， they're tough to reproduce。， Okay。， If you guys all talk right now，。

 you're not as piercing，， and you don't cut through the same way I do。， You gotta work on that。。

 Okay。， So what we're gonna do here is，， I'm just gonna have a few of you guys，。

 like walk up and just open me。， Open me。， I'm a girl。， Just wondering why there's new t-shirts，。

 not just wondering what you think about it。， Okay。， Let's build on that，， linking it to the 10 laws。

， Okay。， Number one，， you use the t-shirt，， and there's nothing necessarily wrong。

 if you actually find it fun，， but in this case，， it's like that old school indirect。。

 You're doing it to compensate and hide your intentions，， or to justify why you're talking to her。。

 Okay。， This is something I yell all the time on bootcamp。， I'm like， shameless， shameless。

 shameless。， What does that mean？， Obviously don't be like crazy， shameless。。

 It means you don't need to justify why you're talking to her。。

 You're talking to her because you're a guy， she's a girl。， It's like， oh。

 so I was walking to talk to you， because of the t-shirt。， It's like， why do you come and talk to me？

， Cause。， Why？， Cause I'm a man。， Shameless。， It's like she should know what's up。。

 When you're fucking her， she knows you like her，， the sooner the better。， Okay。。

 So like from the start，， it's like， hey， what's it going on？， You don't need any reason。

 or logical reason。， Okay。， Number two，， based on what we just talked about，， notice how you walk up。

， what？， You turn。， You walk up，， you look down，， you walk up，， hello， I was just noticing，。

 and there was no eye contact either。， Okay。， So although it's like good intentions，。

 and like general good vibe，， the basic requirements aren't met， cut off。， Try it again。。

 Basic requirements，， building what we talked about， go。， How you doing？， Good， hurry。， I'm good。

 I'm good here。， Just not seem new to LA，， I'm just moved in a month ago。， Are you reprimanded here？。

 All right。， Better，， but let's play with the proximity。， You got in close， which is good，。

 but you stayed in close。， And it's like pressure， pressure， pressure， pressure。， Okay。。

 You'll see me like when I talk to girls， and you sound in footage，。

 I'll get in close like this close， to a fucking ear，， but then also lean back like this。， Like。

 oh wait， what's your name？， Oh cool， nice of you。， Seriously？， What？， Hey， I'll do that。， Okay。。

 It's like ending out。， If I'm like，， hey， what's up， man？， So what do you do？， How's it going？。

 It's like， ugh， like you know。， So try doing that， okay？。

 And try adding also a little bit of passion， in your delivery， a little bit louder。。

 I want something like that cause。， Like， hey， how's it going？， It's like， hello， how's it going？。

 Hey， how's it going？， Okay。， Cool。， Hey， how's it going？， Okay， now match the volume。， Hey。

 how's it going？， Try again。， Hey， how's it going？， Loud， like cut through every inch of your head。。

 Hey， how's it going？， Good， a lot better。， Pretty good。， I see，， a bit different in normal club，。

 but yeah， fine。， Oh， it's totally different， yeah， but。， I see you got your arms closed。。

 What's bothering you？， Where are you assuming something's bothering me？。

 What are you assuming a little bit， you know？， Low， we're in a pie， we're in a club。。

 We're supposed to be having fun， you know？， Hey， you know， what happened to your thumb？。

 Where are you trying to take so much from me？， Where are you not offering？。

 Where's the check this out？， Yeah， the other way， true。， Yeah， do you like my shoes？， I like it。。

 I like it。， Now， I like the fun vibes。， Like the fact you can kind of laugh at it。， Boom。

 there's some value that'll open me up as if I were a girl。， Okay。， You， really good。， You。， You， hi。

， How's it going？， Ben， nice to meet you。， Hey。， Um。， Um。， Give me a hug， hi。。

 It's too much pressure。， Hi。， Um。， I like that little reflex。， Can I kind of link it to the content？

， Uh。， Notice you're like， hey， and you're not getting what you want。， We go into panic mode。。

 We're either bounced out or we do something too crazy。， Like the hug。， Endurance。， Okay。。

 Remember that girl who's like with the two guys。， She's like the one where I'm like， oh。

 like a rat or something like that。， The one who was asking， like。

 one of you guys sitting over here was asking like， when， you get， oh， you， like。

 the look that'll kill you， type thing。， Um。， That's pretty much the look I gave you。。

 You walk up and I was like， good。， And you're just like， uh， hug。， Instead， it's like， stay with it。

， Don't let it。， It's all good。， You're generating。， You're not reacting。， You don't need anything。。

 Okay。， Now try to go in a little louder。， Like， hey， how's it going？， Hi。， Hi。， Hi。， Hi。。

 Who are you？， Julian。， I had these really cool shoes and just here's the LA for the day。。

 You seem very tense。， I'm not actually。， I feel it。， I feel it。， You seem really tense。， Okay。。

 Nice meeting you。， Don't boom。， Don't like dang on the girl like that。， Okay。， Try it again。。

 Deep breath。， Hey， how's it going？， Hey， how's it going？， Louder。， Hey， how's it going？。

 Even louder。， Hey， how's it going？， Even louder。， Hey， how's it going？。

 Why is my voice louder without yelling？， Try。， Match it。， Hey， how's it going？， Hey， how's it going？

， Hey， how's it going？， Hey， how's it going？， How's it going？， Hey， how's it going？， Even louder。。

 Hey， how's it going？， Even louder。， Hey， how's it going？， Hey， how's it going？， Better。， Okay。， Now。

 in your mind， it would probably feel like you're yelling like crazy。， Yeah。， Okay。。

 And this is a big one for all of you guys。， Keep this in mind。。

 When tweaking the basic requirements， you got to swing that pendulum big time。。

 So the point where it feels weird in your head。， Okay。， Like， most people。

 like the way we're conditioned， we're just not that naturally expressive。， You know？。

 Most people just aren't。， And when you start， say， for example， being loud or like him。

 it feels fucking weird。， The same as when you start smiling， like， smile。， Okay。。

 It probably keeps smiling。， It probably feels weird， like you're overdoing it。， Okay。， Now。

 funny enough， it looks way better like that than before。。

 But it's because your internals are not adjusted to this。。

 So you have to go through this awkward phase。， Okay。。

 So the internals readjust to this is the new norm。， Me， my voice， this loud， this is not my default。

， When I started out， I was quieter than all you guys。， I would not be able to do anything like this。

， I'd be like， if it's like， game me， I'd be like， oh， I got to go and probably bounce， out。。

 I'd be gone。， Okay。， Yet， progressively， it's like louder， louder， louder， to this is the norm。。

 Okay。， Now， what we're going to do here， okay， is we're going to do an exercise。。

 We're going to go in groups of four。， So actually split up in groups of four。， Go for it。。

 Go for it。， So we're going to do this one by one for like a minute each。。

 You're going to talk about your journey to the event here today。， Whatever it is。

 you're left like your place。， Maybe you drove here。。

 That's your story that's going to take one minute。， If you're three， that's fine。。

 But you'll just see like， you know， one minute， 20， so each， one minute， 20。， So basically。

 one minute each， your story， your journey to this event。， You're not allowed to lie。。

 You're not allowed to make anything up。， But you better make it the most captivating story。。

 Those other three guys have ever heard in their entire lives。， Okay。， Okay。， It should be loud。。

 It should be engaging。， It should be literally the most exciting thing they've heard today。。

 More exciting than any of the footage we went over。。

 Like they should be hanging onto your every word without lying。， But you can't use the content。。

 And this is big because our default when we're talking to a girl， she's not interested。， It's like。

 it's the content。， I got to get the content up。， It's not interesting content。， Fuck that。。

 The content doesn't matter。， Focus first on the delivery of that content。， Okay。。

 So and focusing on these five here， it's like， are you loud enough？， If you're not loud enough。

 it's tough for them to get sucked in。， If I'm like， so I was walking out of my place today。。

 So I was walking out like， cut through。， It's like， you saw a video like， I'm in your head。。

 It's like， I'm in your head type shit。， Okay。， So I walked out of my door。。

 I walked out the fucking door。， I shut the door。， Okay。， I want that。， I want eye contact。。

 Not just with one of them， with all three of them。， You better balance all three。。

 If you feel like you're losing one， bang， back on the other one。， Facing them。， Not this， ooh。

 like that。， Use proximity。， If you feel like you're losing one too， it's like， if I go in A。

 and I was walking， out the door， doing this， it's a lot more captivating。， Smiling as well。。

 If you're just like， so I walked out the door like that， that's bad。， Put your body into it。。

 Like putting your body helps a lot。， The looser you are。

 yet the more expressive and expansive you are， the better。， If you're cycled。， Loose， loose， loose。

 loose， hands out of your pocket。， All right。， I'll do these checkups by the way。

 as I'll sign out throughout the night。， Like for 30 seconds to admit it。

 just like fucking loosen up and see what's going on， inside and just， okay， back at it。， Okay。。

 But I want it captivating。， That also means even in the way you talk。

 expand your range of expressiveness。， Okay。， That means being loud， being quiet， talking fast。

 talking slow， hitting on different， frequencies， not just being the flat line。。

 Most guys have one frequency。， It's like， so I was walking out of my door and I was doing this and I was doing。

 it's， like， no， I was walking in my door and then I was doing this and this。。

 I want that excitement。， Okay。， So I walked out the door。

 I shut the door and I fucking locked that door。， It's like you're like， like， Shakespeare on stage。。

 That's what I want。， Okay。， And left foot in front of my right foot and I took my first step。。

 Not just that。， Okay。， I want that。， Okay。， And it does mean necessarily going high energy or talking fast because no。

 I put my left， foot in my right。， It's slow but it's still captivating。， Okay。， And the guys。

 the three who are listening to you， as soon as you kind of start feeling， disengaged。

 start turning away。， So when you see them turn away， it's like back to him， back to him。

 back to him。， Or it's single to like amp it up。， Okay。， One minute each。， Decide to go first。。

 Prepare up in groups。， Okay。， One minute。， Your story， your journey to the event today， go。， Louder。

， Why is my voice louder than yours？， Even louder。， Why is my voice louder？。

 You better feel like you're screaming， dude。， Like way louder， cut through。， So basically。

 there's a lot of different obstacles。， Where's Simon？， I'm bored。， There's not enough frequencies。。

 It's not louder。， More。， Louder。， Louder。， All right。， It's been amazing so far。。

 And I've been learning your shit today。， And so far I wonder。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。。

 I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。

， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， I'm so excited。， Lou's feet， Now， you guys are going to show up。。

 louder， you gotta cut through them， cut through them with the voice， more of your body in it。

 more in it， legs， your legs are planets like statue legs， fuck that， dance in and out， proximity。

I'm seeing statue game here，I don't want no statue game， you should be walking in and out。

 you're proximity， speak faster and slower， add some like depth to it， OK pause。

 I do all kinds of training， you know I do like this， I do this like go fast and slow。

 fast and slow because you're speaking at the same speed， and at the same frequency。

 OK so it's like so I do this， and I do a lot of this， and I do a lot of this。

 you want to be like so I do this， and then I also do this， same with tonality， I do this。

 and then I also do this， versus hey I do this all the time， I do this all the time。

 yeah you need some range， massive range， OK hey your voice should cut through the room。

 to the point where when you're staying your story to this group， every group is hearing you。

 try to make it a challenge， like be as loud as I'm talking right now。

 notice how I talk it cuts through everyone， be like that telling your damn story。

 don't just aim for these three guys， aim for the room， keep it going。

 even louder get me to hear it all the way here， louder louder louder， louder louder， everyone。

 another thing to keep in mind， when you're talking， you should feel like massive freedom，Feedum，ok。

This environment here， apart from say going out to a club，is literally the only environment。

you can fully express yourself like this，You ever are you ever going to talk this loud。

and your fucking apartment or house，No， are you going to talk this loud at work，No。

 with your friends family， probably not，This is like you're one environment。

You can fucking let loose，The same with the you know， added a fucking club，We're barred， it's like。

Here is your arena of fun，You can let loose，Let loose，The excited like this is your one spot。

You're showing you are，you have one minute to fully let loose，Go for it，I∢事īoid grow， love，'。Lutdor。

What is this97，ni， this is your favourite，ijn，ONE， Babe，我，没有吧，我给你信道，log 辣，边包，别再不送，别儿，1，现在，现在 不要打我的漂浙。

我们让你们打 所以拿混钱，相对好，对，感谢，啊，有一个下午，行，不知道，就是Ziff，， which we've been doing here，。

 and the other is going a little deeper， and just letting go of whatever is blocking you， okay。。

 A big part of what's blocking you here，， same as game as when you're trying to maintain。

 a certain image， you're trying to be cool， okay。， So for example here， it's like not letting loose。

 because it's still one part of your mind，， you're like， how do I look？， Am I cool。

 Julian's watching，， am I cool， what is Julian thinking？， What is everyone thinking？， Fuck。

 there's more pressure， Julian's thinking。， It's always， let go of all that， okay。。

 And this is something that you'll experience， while out too， and this is something。

 you might have seen also， oh and talk about， when he talks about competitive， versus collaborative。

 okay。， That's one of the big things， I remind myself of，， at all times like， wall out。

 because it'll sneak up on you。， You got to do these checkups，， like how do I feel？。

 I feel a little tense， am I really having a blast？， If you're out tonight。

 you're not having a blast，， it's like， okay， 30 seconds。， What the fuck's going on？。

 Why am I not having a blast？， And you got to find a way to snap the fuck out of that。。

 And the easiest way is，， think as cheesy as it sounds，， gratitude and think collaborative。。

 Gratitude is what？， It's taken a second to just realize，， it's like， here I am in a fucking club。。

 You look around， you snap out of whatever little，， you know， self-pity goggles you have on。

 and be like， I'm out of club。， Everyone's having a blast。， Everyone's here for to have a good time。。

 They're girls。， There's literally no reason， you should not be having a good time。， The clubs。

 the bars， they're designed for you， to have a great time。， If you're not having a great time，。

 the only person responsible is you。， It's you getting in your own ways，， we talked about before。。

 So taking moments like actually knowledge that。， And beyond that，。

 it's not thinking everyone's looking at you， and judging you。。

 It's remembering we're all on the same team。， The same with the girl。。

 A lot of the times we're like， okay， there's the girl。， There's the enemy。。

 There's the girl to conquer。， The big， the final boss。， If you're thinking like that， holy shit。。

 Okay， it's a lot of pressure。， And she'll just feel it。， It's like， you're trying to conquer。。

 Instead， it's like， we're all on the same team。， Okay。

 the best way to open to a part from check this out， is skip the open。。

 Act as if you're already open her。， That's it。， You're already open her act as if。， Hey， so anyway。

 did it。， We're on the same team， okay？， And you can kind of feel the contrast here。。

 So we're gonna do a few。， It's we're all gonna look at him。， We're all gonna hear him tell a story。。

 Now， I want you guys to kind of judge him， and like give him a grade at the end here。， Okay。

 on a skill of one to 10， how good do you do？， I'm not expecting you to do very good， to be honest。。

 You know， I don't think you got it。， And I think everyone's gonna kind of in their mind， be like。

 fuck， thank God， I'm not him。， Like， look， you're already nervous tapping your leg there。。

 If I don't know， man。， Try the story of how we got here。， Yeah。， So everyone's， by the way。

 everyone's judging you， just so he heads up。， And so far， it's a bad start。。

 So it went to the hot team and asked us a couple of weeks ago。， Your voice is a little trembling。。

 Try to try to relax。， Don't just relax once， because you look very nervous， dude。。

 Just take a deep breath and don't fuck this up。， Okay， try to be good。， Is this the loosest？。

 Where is the smile？， On a Saturday to go spend my entire day here。。

 I don't feel very much passionate。， I don't see eye contact with everyone。， I don't see loudness。。

 Why is it so loud？， And the scary part was that I wasn't sure if I was going。

 to get an email or not， like for the location。， There's something super minor。

 but I was really paranoid， about it。， So I kept checking my phone over and over。， Pause。， Rate it。。

 Scale to 1 to 10。， 6， 6， 6。， That's harsh。， Like 3。， It's 6。， 6 is good。， 6， 6， 5， even。， Now。

 we're going to make it a little tougher。， Everyone look at him， like judge him，。

 and just call him out on shit。， Like you can even boo him。， You can do whatever you want。。

 Just like， I want negative pressure on you。， If you make it happen， go。， Yeah， pathetic， dude。。

 Look at this guy， like seriously， boo。， Boo。， Pathetic， dude。， Absolutely pathetic。。

 Is that all you got？， Seriously， dude？， What is this？， It's pathetic。， Boo。。

 This is even worse than before。， Horrible。， Horrible。， Horrible。， Just go， man。， Just go。， Right。。

 Now pause。， Right。， Good。， Really good actually maintaining that one。。

 Now what we're going to do is we're all going to cheer him on， big time。， OK？， Go with the cheers。。

 Again， what I really want is like full smile， looseness，， body， into it like free。。

 Like that's not a free baby。， Like fully free。， And we just cheer him on， clap， applaud。。

 This guy's the fucking champ。， 3， 2， 1， go。， Come on， man。， He got this。， Yeah。， Fuck that。。

 He got this。， Yeah。， Come on， man。， Boo。， Hell yeah。， Yeah。， Even louder。， Even louder。。

 Even louder。， Looser。， Looser。， Here we go。， Here we go。， Boo。， Yeah。， Hey， OK。， Now， super good。。

 Did you guys notice any difference in demeanor？， Because the smile is like the smile。， Yeah。

 it's like suddenly you got the fucking real smile。， Some of you are actually moving around。

 high-fiving everyone。， OK？， The questioner is like， hmm， why wasn't I doing that before？， Well。

 it wasn't my default。， Yeah， let's see how you know a story in this。， OK？， Now， of course。

 this is something you build up to。， The key here is to kind of one， be aware of this dynamic。， OK？。

 And when you're out， a big one's like， oh shit。， Am I competitive or collaborative？。

 Do I think everyone's on my side or judging me or against me？， When the environment overwhelms you。

 everyone's against you。， That's what it does。， When you're shoved in your head。

 when you're kind of like static statue，， you're done。， OK？。

 Taking action will help kind of get out of that。， But otherwise， it's just taking some perspective。。

 It's like you realize， like even here， no one's against you。， It's like we're all on the same boat。。

 You know， we're all working on this。， We're all here。， It kind of like， yeah， you know， from there。。

 And then just knowing what those requirements are。， Remembering that feeling， too。， OK？。

 So what we're going to do is back to the groups of four here。， Let's do it 30 seconds this time。。

 Talk about same story， OK？， Or let's just say， talk about your plans for the night。， 30 seconds。。

 The first 15， let's do one minute。， Sorry。， For the first 30 seconds， I want the three guys。

 to be booing your ass。， Negative looks looking down， booing your ass。， Then when you hear me say。

 I'll say negative。， That's when you boo。， I'll yell positive， then you cheer them on。。

 You keep the same fucking story going。， And you notice similar to how you did，。

 the difference in how you feel inside。， And remember， that's the most important。， And it's like。

 remember， you emotionally recognize this， as we saw in the footage。。

 You emotionally experience it as we're going to do now。， And then you remember it。。

 That's what you have to aim for while out， OK？， So negative first 30 seconds。， Go。， Boom down。。

 Boom down。， Boom down。， Boom down。， Well done。， Thank you。， Oh， boys。， Run。， Start。，宁和白 ich。， Oh。

 my face's like yolks！， I jumped in the green last night。， Someone's looking no more。。

 Now this is my lovable man。， I'm friendly to everybody。， I love everybody， I'm five。， I'm clinical。。

 Have a nice day。， Give me a smile。， Yeah？， Thank you so much。， Unbelievable。， You didn't close。。
