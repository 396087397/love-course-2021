# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：4. 预选：1. 社会认同与预选

十分小的市場，第三mal plus最相當自衛中的， Cook 식比較幫助，我們都見到，甚麼更少例的，自中自衛中都看到，沒有這麼多層次的，珍惜的，特治市場最重要的是，你看見到很多一些，很多些人會依然。

留意雌方專 Euro，例如， shove，這 М월売，所以說沒有，這麼 simple 別點，漸渴的，只是一樣，觀眾覺得它作為恰服，第7個人，作為另一地所打扮的，這位， create更賴區，對這位，太低。

以這同行姿足，又是，我們，他們通通有，一件事，引起尤其 是，活覺，繁掌虛，你女性，會有 gentle social proof 但女性使誰，女性是刻意被抓給至於、政治火靈，或者女性被抓給不定。

女性一座 theatre她學了你， slavery ad 腳背，英格拉，一個人面臂九弟，然後再來思想，最適合她，然後她不會傳 created，和他會最後冰淇冰，然後她有的男性，如果年輕。

年的女性商量兩個印象，普京的女性旋律，給人生來 explore，那會 be the most attractive，因為 they're in a state of being pleasant。

 they're in a state of having fun， of enjoying themselves， social proof and pre-selection。

 can be used in both your long-term social circle blueprint plan。

 and in your one-night social circle plan， your one-night social circle plan。

 is what I call a situation where， you don't have a lot of time。

 you don't have weeks or months to be in the city， kind of like myself I travel a lot。

 but you still want to attain a high status， high leverage night for yourself。

 maybe you are in a convention， or you travel a lot for work and you're in hotel bars。

 but you see a girl who's just completely， to be frank out of your league， how do you get that girl？。

 well you just can't have an abundant mentality， realistically。

 because there's only that one girl at that hotel bar， you don't have 15， 20。

 30 of these girls these hotel bars， you have the one or two girls you're into。

 so the best way to get that girl， the most realistic way to get that girl。

 is using pre-selection and social proof， and some of the other points that I'll mention in the one-night social circle plan。

 but that entire module is designed， to use social circle tactics， for same-night lays。

 one-night stands， that kind of thing， you can build a social proof and pre-selection。

 to a large scale， or you can build it to a very small scale。

 and you're going to see a relative increase of decrease in the results from that。

 I build social proof， throughout my entire day， for two reasons， one to keep myself sharp。

 so I know how to always be building that social proof， and two， because I know that。

 there's always opportunities to build social proof， but I don't necessarily know。

 when the type of girl that comes to my life， is necessarily going to come into my life。

 so whether I'm doing day game or night game， or you know I'm in the mall。

 or I'm in a crazy party setting， I don't necessarily know when I'm going to see that exact type of girl that I like。

 the one that's going to really make me go crazy， you know exactly the one I'm talking about。

 the one that kind of motivates you to go through all the bad sets。

 that girl is the exact one that I'm， gaming for， the one that I'm practicing for。

 but I don't want to be so tied to her that I end up losing my mind over her。

 I don't want to be so tied to her that I end up making bad mistakes。

 so what instead what I do is build so much social proof throughout my day， that that girl。

 it's essentially a funnel that she just slides on into my life。

 without me having to do that much work， the more of a funnel aspect you can create in your life。

 the more confidence and self-esteem you're going to build。

 because once you've established that funnel concept， you'll have immense consistency。

 remember consistency breeds amazing level of self-esteem and confidence。

 the more consistency you have the more confidence you're going to be。

 so if you can find ways to increase your consistency。

 then you're going to by default be an extremely confident， high status self-esteem male。

 social proof is one of those things that works extremely well。

 but rarely do you actually see somebody employing social proof techniques。

 very rarely do you see somebody that every higher-dgon。

 male or female they're exchanging names with， they're sharing a few quips here and there。

 a few breaks or four or a few teasers， you really want to focus on building in that social proof。

 with every single person that you encounter， because if you're not disciplined and focused to build that。

 it will never be a habit， it will never be intuitive inside of you。

 so then when that type of girl does walk by， that you vision board and that you've completely decided。

 that's exactly what you're going to be after， when she does walk past。

 and you haven't been developing your social proof building abilities。

 and your pre-selection abilities， she's just going to walk right past you without you actually taking action。

 however if you've created a reverse approach anxiety， where you have more anxiety over girls。

 and different interactions that will go right past you， you have FOMO fear of missing out。

 to such a degree that you're kicking yourself， for every girl that you don't approach。

 there's a switch there's a trigger that happens， and once that switch is flipped。

 you end up in a very positive， high confident based situation， you really want to focus on。

 building that social proof， not just at the beginning of the day but throughout your entire day。

 one of the benefits of building social proof， is that you're going to build massive attraction。

 and report the same time， the way attraction and rapport work。

 is that it's like a teeter taught or a seesaw， every time you build attraction。

 it lowers your comfort， lowers your rapport， and every time you raise your rapport。

 it lowers your attraction， but every once in a while you'll find something like， social proof。

 it raises your attraction， and it raises your rapport， in the girl's mind。

 so throughout the day you build that social proof， maybe your stuck at the beginning。

 you're not really sure how to build that social proof， you've seen my YouTube videos。

 I've been partying with 15-20 girls at a time， you've maybe been out with me and you've seen me。

 you know go out with multiple girls at one time， maybe not quite at that level。

 I like to show those things to you， so that you can see where the path leads。

 where you can kind of take this， but let's say you're just starting out。

 very easy way to get started， is by doing local happy hours。

 with girls that are clearly not sexually interested in you， or you necessarily in them。

 the reason why this is so powerful， is because the whole happy hour concept。

 enables you to really get pre-selection， and social proof， without you having any risk。

 because in most cities and most places， it's no negative at all， to invite people to happy hours。

 a very commonplace activity， the next thing with social proof to understand。

 is the sexual interest back and forth， is kind of irrelevant， with most of your female friends。

 you're going to want to be， a bit sexual back and forth with them。

 you're going to want to tease about different sexual topics， my closest female friends， non-stop。

 we're just hazing each other， about different sexual jokes， we're sending each other sexual memes。

 it's like a non-stop， verbal assault of different jokes， that we're saying with each other。

 it's almost like a one-uping type of situation， you're going to find that。

 with most of the girls that you're befriending， they're going to want to do two things。

 they're going to want to talk a lot more sexually， around you than you originally thought。

 they're going to， and be they're going to actually， want to contribute to bringing you girls。

 this is when I refer to the U Army， which in future modules， I'll explain in depth。

 when I talk about the U Army， this is exactly what I'm describing， is creating this group of people。

 around you that are excited， and thrilled to throw girls at you， at first if you're new to this。

 you might be wondering， well why would people want to be throwing girls at me。

 or maybe you're not new to this， maybe you're an experienced， cold approach pickabartist。

 and you're just flabbergasted or confused， why people would actually want to bring you girls。

 and what I'm going to show you is exactly， how to get people to bring these girls on a silver platter。

 where they're mad if you don't hook up， where they're very excited。

 that they got to play matchmaker， the easiest hack for this。

 is to realize that every girl in the world， likes playing matchmaker。

 whether it's a coworker of yours， whether it's a neighbor， whether it's an ex-girlfriend of yours。

 every girl likes to play matchmaker， they want to set people up， the problem is most guys。

 just don't have the balls， or the frame control， if you will。

 to actually set that kind of paradigm up， it's very difficult for them to actually。

 create a realistic situation， where the women in their life， actively go out and bring them girls。

 the real alpha trait， the real alpha characteristic， is a male who doesn't have to go out。

 and hunt and gather the women into his life， he's somebody who has the ability to do that。

 if he wants， but instead it's taking that， and creating leverage for yourself。

 the more leverage that you create， the more confidence in self-esteem， you're going to have。

 if you can focus your efforts on creating， high leverage in your life， especially with women。

 it's very easy to create high leverage in your work life， or other parts of your normal life。

 but with women， things are so subjective， and there's so many personal feelings that are on the line。

 it's difficult to take a step back， and actually look at things with accurate glasses。

 social proof really combines， your ability to engage with， and have an infectious personality。

 and win over both men and women， but the type of men and women， that you want to win over。

 the type of men and women that are， excited to be in your company。

 that's a major key to having consistency， which then in turn gets you the confidence。

 when you have social proof， confidence is such an afterthought。

 however when you're trying to achieve confidence， for confidence sake， it's much more difficult。

 because it's more vague， it's more verbose， but when I tell you， the technique to go meet 15 people。

 have them surround you， create a aura around you， of these people who are all trying to get your attention。

 watch what will happen to your confidence， what do you think will happen to yourself a steam。

 it's obvious that we'll go through the roof， once you've created proper social proof。

 I dare you to try to have， negative emotion， I dare you to try to be in bad state。

 or to have a lack of confidence， sometimes creating social proof。

 will actually give you more confidence， than sleeping with a beautiful woman。

 creating aggressive social proof， is not only one of the most attractive things that you can do。

 but it also gives you， insane levels of confidence， and then it also， creates an effect。

 where you're not actually the player， you're not the one who's hitting on all the girls。

 when you can create this effect， where you can hit on as many girls as you want。

 but no one really knows that you're doing it， no one can tell。

 because you have all the social proof， because you're triggering the investment switch。

 so that every girl that you talk to， is investing in you both verbally and physically。

 you'll understand that， you don't have to have this high-risk， high-reward type of game。

 you can game at your work， you can game at your school， you can try to pick up girls。

 at your local coffee shop， and you can be aggressively doing the style of game。

 with zero risk whatsoever， zero social repercussion， imagine what kind of confidence you'd have。

 if I could guarantee you， never to actually have any negative， social repercussion ever again。

 from anything that you would ever do， there's a little quote that， I have that's in my living room。

 and it says， imagine what you could do， if you knew you could not fail。

 that's really how you want to look， at your structured approach to game。

 imagine the type of success you'd have with women， if you knew that you couldn't fail。

 well your confidence would be through the roof， in future sections。

 I'll show you exactly how to get this kind of social proof， I'll give you the exact rundown。

 of what my day is like， from the start of my day， throughout my entire day， to the end of the day。

 when I put my head on my pillow， and you'll see exactly how much， social proof I'm building。

 you'll also see exactly why it's easy for me to， stay sharp， and not have to warm up ever。

 when you're doing an aggressive， social proof style of game， you never have a warm up period。

 you never have to get things going， because you're always talking to people。

 you're going to notice that， you'll be able to flirt with girls。

 at your work at your college campus， with no repercussion at all。

 people will just think that you're， very popular that people， just want to talk to you。

 that cool guys and very attractive girls， are just trying to talk to you or you're off。

 this does amazing things， for your self-esteem and confidence。

 these are just some very tangible ways， for you to build that confidence for yourself。

 in future sections and modules， I'm going to go through exactly what you need to do。

 to create this lifestyle for yourself， so that not only do you have the。

 mental foundation of the confidence， but you're also able to reap the， tangible rewards of that。

 social proof and pre-selection， pre-selection is the advanced version of， social proof。

 pre-selection is social proof， but of women， when women find you interesting， engaging。

 attracted to you， other women are going to find you， irresistible， there's an exponential effect。

 if an average girl， very clearly finds you attractive， and makes it known to women in the area。

 either subtly or not so subtly， women that are much more attractive than her。

 are going to find you attractive， pre-selection is one of the rare things。

 that are proven by psychologists， and scientists and different tests， over time。

 we want to take advantage of， as many of these things as we possibly can。

 rather than just us randomly using case studies， when you have something that's as effective。

 as pre-selection， to the point where there's been studies done on this， you want to look at the。

 you want to really take that， and run with it， rather than you just。

 randomly approaching interactions， and just seeing what happens， and throwing caution to the wind。

 the entire goal of， the social circle blueprint， is to create more time in your life。

 to create a better lifestyle for yourself， so not only do you not， pick up and seduce women。

 at will， but you're also actually able to take， more control over your life， in a way that。

 you desire， when you can create pre-selection， either on a small level。

 or to a very very high degree， you're able to have that exact control。

 and create those kinds of options in your life， on the high end。

 the type of pre-selection that you can build， type of guys that I make friends with。

 the type of guys that I network with， the type of guys that I connect with。

 and then I'll show you how to bond， with a network with as well， they go to nightclub with 15。

 and 20， 30 girls at a time， I remember just a couple of months ago。

 I went to a nightclub with 90 girls， I didn't even know， how we were going to fit them all。

 in the area that we were in， it was all color coordinated， it was crazy。

 when you make friends with guys， like that， photographers， guys who own modeling companies。

 nightclub hosts， there's a wide array of guys， who just have access to， a large amount of women。

 they have advanced pre-selection， they have such high pre-selection。

 that they really don't even have time to gain， because they're too busy。

 corralling all of the girls， that they have pre-selected， that attraction really just。

 is not their problem， their biggest problem， is the fact that， the bucket of pre-selection。

 overflowed， they now need to build， a lot more rapport and trust， because girls。

 then look at them as a player， or someone who's not exactly， datable。

 then on the other end of the spectrum， take a guy， who's never， ever had， a female friend。

 take you for example， let's say you're starting from square one， starting from scratch。

 your entire goal should be， to have your main， wing person， be a pivot， be a wing woman。

 your entire goal， if you aren't going out with women， right now， if you aren't actually。

 taking women to the nightclub， if you don't know most of the girls。

 in the settings that you're actually in， your first goal， should just be to meet one girl。

 that's excited to go out with you， and she's your pivot， a pivot is a， classic term for a girl。

 who's willing to， help you meet and attract women， they're everywhere， and most girls that you meet。

 are excited to play matchmaker， that is not the challenge。

 the challenge really is coaching that girl， and the best way to， game up the club。

 or introduce you to girls， that's really more the challenge。

 in the bonus section of the social group， I actually go into detail， with how to coach girls。

 whether it's your， friend， coworker from work， or your fiance， or girlfriend。

 or whatever relationship， you actually have with that girl， I go through in deep detail。

 exactly how to train， and coach her， and encourage her， to gain for you， the right way。

 to really be a structured， asset to your social life， rather than just being the。

 pre-selection arm candy， again they want to be coached， they're excited to participate。

 and the more that you show them， how to participate， into your success。

 the more excited they actually are， and then it's just this， positive spiral upward， pre-selection。

 is the most effective， attraction tool， hands down， you can build pre-selection。

 just like social proof， over a long period of time， by meeting girls。

 that are going to similar places， that you're going to， building a bit of a roster。

 of girls that are just friends， of yours that go out with you， to all the way to the other end。

 of the spectrum， of building pre-selection， in one night， where you aren't taking days。

 or weeks or months， to build it up， where in the course， of one evening， you build pre-selection。

 in a bar， nightclub-type setting， and you use that pre-selection。

 to then get the most attractive girl in that area， you'll find those。

 rapid pre-selection building techniques， in the one night， social circle plan， it's crazy to me。

 how many guys， will talk to their wingmen， either on the phone， before they go to the nightclub。

 or at the nightclub， they'll be standing there， talking to their wingbuddy， rather than。

 go off and get a winggirl， rather than go off， and realize that， it's much better。

 for them to be surrounded by women， I will very rarely walk into a nightclub。

 with one of my guy friends， me and him can have drinks later， me and him can go do something else。

 but if you're a very close guy friend of mine， and we go to a nightclub together。

 you're going to know that there's a， almost 0% chance， that you and I are sticking together。

 we're going to walk into that nightclub， go our separate ways， text each other。

 for we need anything， and then， exit that nightclub， with success， we're not going to。

 keep discussing our night， as the night progresses with each other， we'll discuss it， tomorrow。

 you need to avoid， talking to your wingman， you need to avoid， talking to your guy buddy。

 throughout the night， about how each interaction goes， instead of focusing on。

 where your wingman is in the night， focus instead on building。

 as many cheerleaders for yourself as possible， which is going to stack the U-Army。

 the stronger your U-Army is， the more depth， and the more quantity that you have。

 of these cheerleaders， the more confidence you're going to have。

 and more self-esteem you're going to have， even if those cheerleaders aren't around。

 because you're going to have， real abundance， a real abundant mentality。

 the only way to not fake abundance， to have actual solid abundant mentality。

 is to have aggressive pre-selection， where you know that， if you don't have success tonight。

 or some girl， pisses you off， that you have a few girls lined up， that are ready to have your back。

 that are ready to talk to you about the situation， when you have that。

 and you have girls that are actively looking， for girls that are your type。

 girls that are pursuing other girls， for you， girls that know that， your type is either。

 a slender short blonde girl， or maybe a tall curvy brunette， that when they see that girl。

 they have the motivation， to actually go up to that girl， get her number， and set you guys up。

 accidentally forced blind dates， are an amazing leverage tool， you should be going on。

 multiple dates per week， that you never even， originally， could cold approach the girl。

 the reason why you should be doing this， is because， you're already going to be coming。

 from a much higher place， your status is going to be significantly higher。

 because you have the trust， established from the person， that introduced the two of you。

 especially if it's pre-selection based， if it's a female， that's doing that。

 because there's a lot of， safety， comfort， trust， that's established， from one woman to another。

 that when they make that introduction， they're vouching for you， when you're vouched for。

 you already are， a lot further along that path， than if you were just。

 randomly striking up a conversation， out of the blue， ideally in your own home town。

 you create an atmosphere， where you almost， can't， cold approach， because you have social。

 proof the entire area， I've created situations， for myself where， I love cold approach。

 but I have to do it， in specific places， because everywhere else， I've social proofed。

 and I have not only， about social proof， but I've put connectors in place， where even if I were to。

 burn a little bit of social capital， the connectors will rebuild it， and。

 based off the introductions， that I'm going to give， and my connectors will give， the friendships。

 will start back up again， when those friendships， start back up again， and you're in a race。

 to see who can introduce， who to the most people， that's where we go back， to the confidence。

 increasing dramatically， using the introductions， that are pre-selection based。

 most of them are going to be， women， when you focus on the， female introductions。

 not only not being， introduced to you， but you also introducing， women to each other。

 you're going to notice， that your confidence， points in their mind， is going to be。

 transferred dramatically， when you're making the， introductions to the women， and they're able to。

 actually have a， reasonable conversation， off of the back of the， introduction that you made。

 they're going to pass on， a lot of the， attraction and bonus， points of that conversation。

 on to you， they're going to spill， all that over to you， without you having。

 to actually do much work， you could really， oftentimes make the， introduction， sit back。

 watch the magic， happen， get a drink， go talk to somebody， else， merge an interaction。

 with another interaction， and notice they both， will come after you， and say why you。

 have not introduced me， to this person， sooner， they'll almost be， mad at you for you。

 not making that connection， earlier， and the way that you， play it off， is then transferred。

 into the power of that， connection， they'll legitimately， almost be annoyed。

 that you didn't introduce， them sooner， and all of that gets， passed on to you， very simply put。

 rather than， gaming girls， when you go out， simply try to， introduce one， girl to the next。

 to the next， to the next， and some aren't， going to bond， some aren't going to。

 jive with each other， but the few that do， will come straight back， to you， give you all the credit。

 and now you don't need。
