所以我們談談了你的場合，和讓我們找到瘋瘋，然後我們會變得比較有趣，好，想去瘋瘋一切，然後從那裡，蓋著騎雅匯，在家裡，我就认为显发ase Jamie，有什么意义可能减免，一个人跟 kl casi。

守住云密，和临云密，结果我在结构，每 Arthur，在云密，想一探，每选临对你，这一案，加油，一看，这着，对对对对对对对对对对对에，从开始，想起下次，下次下次下次，那你能不能让我试试，但是你能试试哪些。

哪些是没有，你能试试吗，对，你试试了的，你试试了的，你试试了的，试试了的，好，很大，如果你不试试了的试试，你不试试去试试，每一次你不试试了的试试，你只是试试了，你不试试了的试试，你的试试是，要试试的。

不去试试，那是很大，好，好，现在時間的时候，好，继续，要不要問 sesi，又說我知道，這是我，要說了，正常弄到，射到日子，不要相信，你就會在自己情境上，他會當46代人，而且然後起名後比去，最重要的是。

12個人的，請等一下，都在廣 though，有 你們可以聊天嗎，他昨天說，我全都在就當 Flier，通常他就親着你，問你什麼，說 一直是頭戲，是我開完zy，千後才轉走，我的舊場。

what do I need to know to pull her，what do I need to know to go with her， one。

 who she here with how do they all know each other，ok， number two， what area does she live in。

 that's the plan V for example， it's like where the fuck does she live。

 if you don't know where she lives， you don't know how you're gonna have to go for plan V。

 where's her bed at basically， number three， how is she going home， how is she going back to her bed。

 she's splitting a new burr， is she going home with friends， is she going home alone， how far is it？。

 does she drive here？， is she not going home？， does she have roommates， that's number four。

 how are you going home， do you have roommates， what's her living situation like。

 are her roommates her friends here or not， and number five。

 what is she doing later tonight or tomorrow， if it's in the first part of the night。

 it's what are you doing later tonight， if it's in the second part of the night。

 it's what are you doing tomorrow， so you get the logistics， then you think of the future， plan A。

 plan B， plan C， then there's a few things to keep in mind， you want to start thinking ahead。

 of what could happen， and ask yourself what can I do now， to make it easier then。

 so what does that mean？， say you want to pull it to your place。

 for example hey let's go to my place， I'm not going to wait。

 till the interaction's ending to suggest it， or say hey so I have this movie。

 let's go watch this movie， I'm going to plant that seed earlier on， we call this preceding the pole。

 if it's too out of the blue， no matter how logical the excuse is， it will still feel like a slut。

 because she knows it's too out of the blue， and she knows that she says。

 yeah she'll still see me like a slut， in front of your eyes， so preceding this key。

 it's like you just planting seeds， you want to plant seeds for plan A。

 and you want to plant seeds for plan B， so take this scenario， you're talking to a girl。

 she's with her friend， she loves you， absolutely loves you， hey let's go up to my place。

 let's go this after party， no no no listen my friend's drunk， I have to go home with her。

 she's my roommate as well， I can't leave her， I'm sorry our uber just arrived。

 you're outside the club， she's getting in the uber， I appear， go with her， how do you do it？。

 go with her， you what would you do？， okay nice to meet you， here's our uber， what are you doing？。

 what are you doing？， we're going home， I just told you， she's drunk， I'm bringing my roommate home。

 no she's telling you straight up， no， now what？， no she's drunk， I'm making sure she's going home。

 yes， yes， watch you， and ask her roommate， what she wants to do， you roommate's drunk， she's gone。

 she's throwing up in the cap， let's go for a party， no she's drunk。

 I really got to make sure she gets home， we're going home it's late。

 how many of you guys can make the camera？， our uber is pretty safe thanks though。

 how do you like it？， what's the line？， I want to uber drive it too， now my knee is here， hahaha。

 alright so， now the best one ideally is like say， you know spilling a uber， spitting a cab。

 you're going in the same area， however， if you mention that。

 right before getting in the f***ing cab， oftentimes it's just too out of the blue， it's too like。

 shh， yeah right bro， and like you're done， you know I'm not a slut， so what do you want to do？。

 plant that seed， you can just do a biting， this little habit， every time you ask her。

 so what are you living？， oh that's cool， I have a friend who lives there too。

 I think you're throwing a party later tonight， bang， wherever she lives， you have a f***ing friend。

 that lives there too， who's throwing an after party， later that night， ok， you plant that seed。

 so that say， now it's the f***ing uber， you call back to it， hey you know what。

 that friend I was telling you about， let's split a new bra， I'm going there。

 bang now you're in the cap， and now it's not out， the blue because you preceded it。

 now when you precede though， remember you're just， planting that seed。

 you're not selling your on it， you're just like， oh I have a friend who lives there。

 anyway blah blah blah blah， you simply mention it， I do this with pulling too。

 it's like hey you know yeah， might be throwing an after party later。

 having to drink a couple of friends， anyway blah blah blah。

 it's not like let's go to an after party， there's a time and place for that， you just mention it。

 and ideally the more you mention it， the better， so start thinking ahead。

 what are all the things you could encounter， the uber， once you're in the uber。

 what's another thing you could encounter， you get to her place， she's like well this is us。

 now what how do you get in her place， now you're going your friend， if there's going to your friend。

 this is where I live， where you going your friend， he's not taking on the phone， bang。

 so thinking ahead， yeah that's good， so you get in the fucking uber with her， she's like okay。

 he's going to see his friends， throwing this after party， that lives in the same area。

 you know at some point， she's going to arrive， as we said at her place， and she's like well bye。

 and you're gonna be like， oh there is no friend， you know， so that's fuck， so you think ahead。

 and you ask yourself， what can I do now， so one seed you could plant， is that's weird。

 he's not texting back， anyway， blah blah blah blah， oh you know I really need to use a bathroom。

 anyway blah blah blah blah， oh do you guys have shots， you have drinks， oh cool。

 anyway blah blah blah blah， you get there， he's still not answering， can I wait with you guys。

 you know what else do you use a bathroom， guys run up real fast， let's grab a shot。

 you preceded all that shit， okay， and this is a skill set。

 and you do it all throughout the interaction， and you do it with pulling too。

 if you look at your place in the club， what are the places in between， you can maybe maybe。

 baby separate too， you know at some point， you're gonna want to start。

 baby stepping here for plan A， precede that， but also cover your ass for plan B， and precede that。

 and you do this， while， being on top of the offering value， making yourself feel good。

 being relatable， being real， it's too layers， operates simultaneously， it's tough。

 being aware of how much compliance you're asking for， big， okay， if you're saying a fucking club。

 and you're like， hey let's go back to my place， you're asking for a lot。

 you're asking for a lever friends， to leave the club， to go all the way with you。

 and who knows what will happen， and it's just you're asking for a lot of fucking compliance， okay。

 compliance investment， always go hand in hand， so usually the more times， you spend the more。

 she'll be willing to comply too， but sometimes， it's still a fucking lot， so what do you do。

 you cut it， you small chunk that shit， you ask for a little bit of compliance。

 then a little bit more， then a little bit more， then a little bit more， call this baby stepping。

 okay， so when I'm pulling， I'm thinking okay， how can I just get her one step closer， to plan A。

 plan B， and then once I'm there， how can I get her another step closer， while。

 always preceding for every step of the way， and when preceding too， it's like。

 what are you really doing， you're giving her those logical excuses。

 to do what she mostly wants to do， for her to not feel like a slut， or you're no longer， win win。

 it's no longer relatable， so that's the compliance， the baby stepping， and again I always try。

 plan A but if not， you have to go with plan B， and with plan B， it's not as ideal as plan A， why？。

 as you mentioned， the logistics are not entirely， in your control， and there's a lot more variables。

 if you have your place， and you're pulling her， your place。

 you're getting her away from her friends， you don't have to deal with that shit。

 or the judgment of the friends， you usually， have pulled girls to your place。

 before so you kind of got a routine， you kind of know， what happens， you kind of know maybe。

 the different places， you could become an obstacle， to her goal， and it's kind of more autopilot。

 going to her place， science completely new， there's all these different， you know。

 scenarios maybe a friend will pop out， maybe you'll get there， and there's a fucking roommate。

 you have no idea what will happen， so it's not as， predictable， let's just say。

 but when you go to her place， step number one， don't get psyched out。

 so that means like thinking ahead， like oh fuck what if she lives an hour away。

 what if she doesn't fuck me， what if this happens， what if this happens， what if this happens。

 then you're fucked， just think how can I get， one step closer to her place。

 and trust the once you're that one step closer， you'll figure out the next step， and number two。

 and I made a video about this， it's what makes it more epic， at that point in the night。

 you'll go with her， and you remember， you'll fuck less of the girls， you go with and girls you pull。

 but if you don't fuck them， at least you've got an awesome， epic story to tell。

 what's the alternative， I went home， you know， so I mean， still be calibrated to your work。

 if you're working the next day， sometimes you won't want to go， safe super far away。

 but if it's a weekend， go for it man， who knows， hour away， you'll get a cool story to tell。

 I've had that many times， like my first one， was Geneva way back in the day， in Switzerland。

 pull this girl， like I lived already， 45 minutes away， from Geneva， from train。

 and then I had to walk， all 30 minutes to my place， so I go Geneva， go out， and there's like。

 the last train， that's like at 1am， or something， the next one's at 5， so as soon as I pass。

 at 1am point， it's like， you better fucking， pull or you're fucking， stuck in Geneva， so I'm like。

 fuck it， I'm going， realize like， you know I'm getting， to try to pull， to my friend's place。

 who is there， she's like no， he's like， dude we're going home， so I'm like， hey I'm committing。

 plan B， and I managed to actually， go all the way to her place， which isn't like。

 the suburbs of fucking Geneva， fucker， and then I leave， like I actually did， fuck that one。

 and then I leave， like I'm going to， go all the way to， the station， and then I'm like。

 where's the train station， like that， gets the train station， gets home so on and so forth。

 but it makes an， epic fucking story， you know， it makes it interesting， it's kind of boring。

 if you're always like， okay here we go， like put yourself， in the situations。

 you have no idea what will happen， sometimes you'll， fuck them， sometimes you'll learn， matter what。

 what makes it more epic， and realize that， if you don't try， anything， nothing will ever happen。

 you and then you， have to begin， as you explain， plan B， and if you can， clear the WB steps。

 can you， put some example， for plan A， as well， I mean I'm beginning， with the， dumb。

 hey let's grab some water， at the bar， hey you know what， my friends in front， let's go say。

 how to my friend， oh I thought he was， here， oh you know what， there's this food， place here。

 let's just run real fast， we'll be right back in， you know what， fuck this food place， I know this。

 awesome other place， two blocks away， there you go， bang bang bang bang bang， do you actually。

 know what， basically， I know， that's the， thing that， is that， that's going on， based on， sure。

 that was actually my， that was my day two， move， every day two I had， in Switzerland。

 was let's go watch a movie， watch a movie， it's so， somebody， goes like， let's go watch a movie。

 and it's just bad， it's like that was it， like let's go watch a movie， and then， like you。

 just ideally， with the movie， play something， like， just like， long and boring， like just really。

 boring， and then you just， fuck him， yeah， the movie is like， it's actually a good， one， movie。

 after party is really， good， let's grab drinks， and realize that， again this is just， to grease the。

 process， usually pulling， it always comes as a， byproduct of the， first four laws， or the。

 once even with， the， related， everything before， that， you， can see that， I do not， propose it。

 because I make， a film， and I basically， end up， tonight， in the， office， and， I， propose it。

 while still being， aware of her goals， not being an obstacle， thus giving her， logical reasons。

 not saying， let's go fuck， because now it's， not a win-win， you know， yeah， whenever。

 you're in the club， or let's say， you beat up， with the girl， or， you're， kind of already。

 leading her， inside the place， oh， when we go upstairs， there's a， patty， oh， when we go back。

 downstairs， there's a， project， and that， is， to， follow， you， like， is that still， part of it。

 yeah， but I wouldn't be， aware， I wouldn't be， so focused on that， many get too， paranoid。

 and it would， be，那要塞， but realize that she has to say that， Do not seem like a slut。

 and then of course sometimes you open girls and you don't fuck them。

 So the sex at the end is not always a guarantee， some girls it's just not their goal that night to get laid。

 no matter how cool you are， but if you don't follow this you'll never get laid at all。

 you'll never find out， and two things to keep in mind too， the plain of the paradoxes。

 actually this is on this， paradoxes are within the interaction。

 but the other layers within the night， okay， and I mentioned this before。

 there's the tempo of the night， let me erase this shit， so tempo of the night。

 here in San Francisco， should start at 10， let's say 12， 30， let's say 2。

 this is part one of the night， this is part two of the night， this is part three of the night。

 and you want to play this as well， you want to play it within the interaction。

 play in the paradoxes， and throughout the night， so in this first part of the night。

 it's very rare that it's a girl's goal to get fucked， it's just too fucking early。

 so because of that you eliminate A and B， you go for C， that's it， you can't pull her。

 you can't go with her， so you get her number， so during this first part。

 you're going to be getting a lot of logistics and a lot of phone numbers， okay。

 ideally every girl you talk to before midnight 30， you answer。

 you get the answers to those five questions， and you get her number， and when you get her number。

 you mention what are you doing later tonight， you always want to day two a girl。

 as soon as possible， as soon as place where you can day two or fuck her， is later that night。

 and a lot of girls are hoping to see you later that night。

 another point is be sure you're reopening sets， if you're not reopening。

 you're also leaving a lot on the table， because your game can be 10 out of 10， the girl loves you。

 too early to have that four hour conversation， number and she's like fuck。

 I hope I see that guy later， when I'm ready to fuck， and then you're like oh I already opened her。

 you miss out on a lot， okay， so let's hang out later tonight， what are you doing later tonight。

 let's grab a drink later tonight， we'll text you， bank， get the number， text her your name， at 1230。

 usually you'll get a feel in the vibe， but I'll text all those numbers where are you。

 just throw it out see how they react， all the numbers from this part， where are you， where are you。

 where are you， and at this point， you need to commit to a set， that means pick that girl。

 where you're going to spend say maybe 45 minutes， to an hour and a half， and either pull or go with。

 and this is big， a pull or a go with， usually takes 45 minutes to an hour and a half， if not more。

 if you're not getting results， and all your interactions are shorter than that。

 focus on having those long sets， we always tend to think we need better game。

 now if you're not passing the 45 minutes to an hour and a half， you're not even in the game。

 that's a basic requirement for A or B， okay， that's a number of reasons like big reason guys don't pull。

 they just don't have long sets at all， and ideally throughout the night。

 you want to easier way into that， so instead of having five-minute interactions。

 and then switching to 45 minutes to an hour and a half。

 try to make every interaction a little bit longer， than the previous one。

 so you kind of ease your way in， but at midnight 30 it's time to pick a girl。

 it could be a new girl， it could be one of your numbers， or one of the girls you talked to before。

 but you have to pick a girl， and commit to her， and it's like that's the girl for the night。

 now when you pick a girl， and you commit to her， what you also realize。

 is that as soon as you commit， you're like this is the girl for the night。

 a million better options are going to pop up， the grass is always greener on the other side。

 you'd be like oh but maybe her， maybe her maybe her， and what do most guys do？， maybe her。

 maybe her， and at the end they're left with nothing， so at midnight 30 you better commit。

 you better make a decision， you might have made the right decision。

 you might have made the wrong decision， maybe there was a better option。

 but if you don't make a decision， you're not going to get anything。

 so make a decision and make a rule to just stick to it， then in most cases， it'll be good。

 and in as a few cases， yeah you made the wrong decision， you fucked up， but that's part two。

 and that's your try for A or B， and you have that long set， and if that fails， you're in part three。

 and that's like the very end of the night， clubs closed kind of， you have the street sets。

 the outflow， it's a lot more chaotic， it's not an ideal， you know， scenario。

 but the plus side is the， bind temperatures high， and for a lot of those girls。

 it's now a win-win to go home and fuck you， okay， that emotional build-up。

 they're ready for the climax， and I'll transfer on whoever's， the last dig standing， let's just say。

 so， it's a lot more hectic， most of the time， it'll have to be planned B。

 unless you sell them on an after party， but it's mainly like open， fun， kind of go with the flow。

 try to walk her home， try to walk her home， see what happens， or at this point。

 I call all the fucking numbers， I got in the first part of the night， you play it like this。

 you'll maximize your results， collect leads， numbers， logistics， text where are you。

 commit to a set， ideally pull or go with， if not， walk home， play off the bind temperature。

 and recall those numbers， and find out where they are， and try to meet up with them。

 that's the logical， over the night， and within the interaction， it's logistics， precede， baby step。

 give her logical reasons， don't make her feel like a slut， on top of all the， shea here， yeah。

 all the numbers you call， and they all， we call them， reject the e-tip number， or the e-tip number。

 they can detect， they can detect， who's going to make her， and she says， when you take the numbers。

 with antics， you have to go， there to decree， exit， do not， look， Ok， When you collect them。

 collect， whatever， dynamic，HAEL， maybe， it changes， you're， do， really， follow， everybody， them。

 track， move， DO， if， these numbers， give them， an， ideas，所以， dinosaur。

人 are always scanning the environment， and doing like， bang bang bang。。。， I don't！， I don't pursue。

 I attract，so whenever I keep scanning the environment， what is the communicate？。

 The party's not here， it's elsewhere， so I generate the fun and I draw them in。

 so you'll never see me like， that one and like walk through the fucking venue to say hi。

 that one now， and walk through the venue to say hi， the girls I open are always within arms length。

 that's it， I know I'm going to be very social and talk to a lot of girls。

I know i'm gonna move around the venue，At some point if there's a hot girl there。

I'm gonna talk to her， there's a byproduct of doing that，I don't need to worry about it。

 So usually the way girls would see me， is it seems like i'm the social dude。

 just bringing everyone into his fun，So you don't stand out so much， like。

 oh look at him just spam approaching， or being picky， It's like， who the fuck's this guy。

 Why is he having a fucking blast， there's a woman of the pool， and everyone's talking to him。

That's the ideal vibe，Yeah，What were the five questions again？， Who are you here with？

 How do you guys know each other？， What area do you live in？， How are you going home？

 Do you have roommates？， What are you doing later tonight or tomorrow？， Okay。

 if it's in the first part， it's what are you doing later tonight？。

 Because that's when you day two her。， If it's second part， ideally don't go for the number，。

 but if you have to， what are you doing tomorrow？， Day two or as soon as possible。

。
