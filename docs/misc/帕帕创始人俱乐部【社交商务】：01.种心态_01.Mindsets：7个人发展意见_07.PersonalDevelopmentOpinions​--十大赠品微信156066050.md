what are my opinions on personal development overall？， first of all。

 I am hardcore into formal education， I am hardcore into the process of continual education and learning。

hard core， I've considered every possible kind of long term professional degree。

 from business school， law school， and medical school， I've considered the process of getting PhDs。

 I consider all this stuff， and what I've done is I've done 2 MBA programs。

 and now I've made law at Harvard for master's degree。

 And I'm also looking probably gain high-level education， throughzę AHU for future as well。

 I'm really interested in this because I found that， from the formal education process。

 although it fails the law of other people， is succeeded for me to allow me not necessarily。

 from these textbooks，ny currently such a broad range，因為我氣氛太低，人趣，使說與同籤，網�uttoinnovation，筳ジャー，man，man。

 In my head I'm from was watching videos or reading， I think is kinda like learn thinking conclusion。

 and I think other people maybe have that different learning style。

 For me I watch a lot more ofNetflix， TV shows， Now quote movies and TV shows。

 Probably just as much as Tyler quotes books， I think a lot of that has to come though。

 because we learn in different ways， And also because I use a lot of。

 Usually the possibilities of the impossible exist， it's real。

 you could actually make almost anything happen。， And I like that framework。

 and deeply in my mind as a result， I study personal poop because I believe it almost everything is a skill set。

， I believe that there is nothing out there that is too difficult。

 that can't be accomplished if you're going to put the time into the process of mastery。。

 And I believe deeply in that process。 The process of mastery is very detailed and written out in a book called Mastery by George Leonard。

， It was a book that talks about how mastery is like a broken staircase where you might grow and you might get successes and then you kind of go down a bit and try to skill set。

， And you go and then you keep going at it and then some of you hit a new plateau， a higher plateau。

 and it keeps going up and up and up。， And that's something that people will be surprised about because some people will just view it as like this jagged cliff where you might just be at a skill set and then suddenly you just drop down lower and you don't know why。

， And it's because the process of mastery is a sluggish looking curve。， But in the long run。

 you put in the time， you will get success， you will get more success than you had in the past if you put in the time and in the long run overall。

 like an investment。， That is kind of fickle， but over time if you just stay to it as opposed to pulling out early。

 you will get that long term financial gain。， You will get that long term personal gain over mastery when you do that。

 when you stick it out。， If you surround yourself with people who have that same value and are offering that same attitude。

 you are also more likely to see together。， That's why it's always better to have a mastermind。

 people that have that same somewhere mindset。， So I always surround myself in some kind of structures。

 some kind of mastermind from my personal success or in business。， Because even when you're failing。

 the biggest and greatest security that you could have in terms of a safety net。

 you're just having these people that have this kind of level of success， personal success。

 it's kind of mastermind around you because they'll have your back。。

 And that's why it's so important also to cut out the leeches because the people that are emotionally draining on your resources。

 on your time， you cut them out and you're going to have an overall more powerful network。。

 You are constantly told by gurus or successful that you are the average and the five people you hang around most。

 the average of their financial success or wealth， their personal success and their attitude in terms of abilities to push things forward。

， People will see that continually at the same time。

 you also can be that star that shines above and leads everyone else's success so that everyone else rises because people naturally emulate the people around them。

， That's why I think it's so important to surround yourself with optimists， not pessimists。

 And that's their optimist in disguise and it's your job to inspire them， for example。

 in your family。， Sometimes you just get down on themselves。

 yet they know they have that inner belief and sometimes you just have a temporary period of time where they're just not who they really are deep down inside。

， And you just need to recognize the difference between those kind of people and those people that are not the kind of people that would contribute to your personal development goals。
