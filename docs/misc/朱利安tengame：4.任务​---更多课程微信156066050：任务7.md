# 朱利安ten game：4.任务​---更多课程微信156066050：任务 7

我還說過， before I laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，但我的舌頭，I just can't take my eyes。

Can't take my eyes of you，This is Julian，and welcome to mission number seven，ok now this one here。

 first of all，we're keeping as always the going out every single day。

So for the next seven days straight，you're out for minimum of twenty to thirty minutes daily。

ok this can be during the day，可以在晚上，你能拼拼5分钟，这不是什么意思，我希望你，在一起的女生，每个天，现在我们要去，我们要去这儿，去做摩羊盛，而不是有这样一个，特别的。

特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的，特别的。

特别的，佳童，建议，月花，月花，月花，月花，月花，月花，月花，</G，g，或 involve other girls and start merging sets，ok。

 so to build our way there，what I want to do this week is one of the times you go out。

 during that session for 10 minutes， and I want you to time yourself with this， if you have a wing。

 have your wing come out with you because it kind of helps。

 but for 10 minutes straight you're going to time yourself。

 you're not allowed to be out of set for more than 5 seconds。

 and you're not allowed to be in set for more than 30 seconds， ok。

 so this will get you pretty much mass approaching， and thinking ADD。

 because you don't have time to have that long interaction， which is you and hurts quickly， ok。

 next one， next one， next one， it's also a great way to。

 you know turn off your thinking mind like if you go out。

 and you're kind of in your head you're like， oh I'm in my head， if you just take so much action。

 your mind will just shut off， ok， so the way this works is you start to time yourself。

 10 minutes starting now， and as soon as you start it's 5， 4， 3， 2， 1， for you to open a girl， ok。

 you're not allowed to be out of set for more than 5 seconds， it's not slow 5 seconds like。

 you mosing around it's， hey let's go 5， 4， you have to be oh shit like quickly next one。

 if you open， and say you get rejected， you're like oh I'm not interested， it's back to 5， 4。

 you're like fuck next one， ok， if it goes well you can stay in for 30 seconds， but no longer。

 so after 30 seconds it's back to the 5， 4， 3， ok， so you're pretty much like bang bang bang bang bang bang。

 ok， ADD， where's the next girl， it also gets rid of that judgment， like oh is it an easy set。

 oh is there guys in there， just like jump in， ok， so that's something I want you to do。

 during 10 minutes straight， ok， you're not allowed to be out of set for more than 5 seconds。

 you're not allowed to be in set for more than 30 seconds， and again if you have a wing。

 who literally comes up to you every time you leave， it's like he's like 5， 4， 3。

 or he times the 30 seconds pulls you out of set 5， 4， 3， that helps a lot， ok。

 and you can come up if you want to for extra leverage， is you know some kind of like consequence。

 if you take longer than 5 seconds， like maybe it's push up in the club or something。

 so that's the second thing， ok， 7 days straight， 20 to 30 minutes， for 10 minutes， ok。

 on one of the sessions， this mass approach， now building on that the third thing。

 I want to do this week is to work on， getting ourselves out of a， quote unquote state crash， ok。

 where you just embrace how you feel， and it's like oh， a state crash game， and let it arise again。

 so when you're out say one of the nights， and you guy yourself into this very nice， you know state。

 as soon as you're like oh I've been state， I want you to stop talking to everyone。

 and just kind of go in the corner of the venue， and wait until it just kind of drops。

 and then when it's back to ground zero， I want you to practice rebuilding that， ok。

 then once you're in the zone again， go back in the corner， wait till it drops， back to ground zero。

 build it up so it's like building a fucking muscle， doing the reps， rewatch 10 game to know。

 how to go about this， but it's really embracing it， it's not trying to force things。

 it's not panicking， it's just really， wherever I'm at whatever I'm feeling， it's all good， ok。

 and the more you do this， these you'll be， the less you'll freak out obviously。

 so just kind of practice that， ok， when you're out， and you're in state。

 you know for a few times just， go in the corner and let it drop， ok。

 till you're really in your head， in the corner it's like you're not even having fun。

 you're just kind of static， until the environment kind of overwhelms you， and then you rebuild it。

 and the last thing here what I want you to do， is one of the， you know days or nights， you go out。

 I want you to find， the hottest girl， I'm gonna hottest girl， in the venue。

 and walk up to her and get a picture with her， and post it in the Facebook group， ok， of course。

 blur her face， you can blur your face too if you want， but I want this on one hand， to make sure。

 you're going to fuck out， and you're just not typing from your computer。

 so it'll force you to get out of the house， and secondly， ok， you hear me talk about。

 you have to talk to everyone， ok， girls you find attractive， not attractive。

 it should be the same thing， but this can， sometimes turn into an excuse where。

 you just don't go up to， you know， attractive girls at all。

 and you just kind of rationalize your way， I'm talking to everyone。

 so what I want you to do here is， say you're in a club， it's literally， find， you know。

 the most attractive girl， ok， where you can even say， by superficial standards。

 the most attractive girl， and I don't care where she is， she could be at a fucking VIP table。

 she could be surrounded by guys， you need to walk up， and get a fucking picture with her。

 and post it in the group， ok， so it's that no excuse， go to the hot girl too。

 to make sure this talk to everyone， is not， you know， some form of rationalization， for just stain。

 in your comfort zone， ok， so， 70s straight， 20， 30 minutes， 10 minutes mass approach。

 getting yourself from out of state to in state， building that muscle， and lastly。

 picture with the hottest girl， in the venue， good luck。
