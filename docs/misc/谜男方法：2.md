A3，A3，A3，A3，Mail to female interest，The girl already likes you，You already got I。O。I。S。

You got some I。O。I。S，Hey， this shinin' for free，You know， hands off from merchandise，Wow。

 she was like this，Next thing you know， she'll start hitting on you，It will happen。

Watch it in the field，It's kinda creepy，It's weird how quickly it'll happen。

Can I try in your glasses？，No， I don't know，You're from a hole in the wall，Your head's big。

You're gonna stretch out my glasses，You know， things can only stretch so freaking far before they snap。

So you throw things like that in，And you're nice，You know， or they try to grab this。

If a girl touches this，Watch it for it，Okay， if they touch it，She's attracted to me。

If I'm wearing my big ass platform boots，And she says， hey， I love your boots，I'll respond，No。

 you don't，You're attracted to me，If I wear this big ass hat，That I was sometimes wear out。

And she goes， hey， I love your hat，No， you don't，You're attracted to me，Think about it。

What if you went up to a girl and looked at her shoes and went，Wow， I love your shoes，And she goes。

 no， you don't，You're attracted to me，And walked off，You've telegraphed your interest。

What are you gonna go up to and ugly girl and say， hey， I love your shoes，No。

 you're just an idiot trying to come up with some sort of way of communicating your interest。

And you've used shoes as the option，Like she's never gotten that before，Like， I've never gotten that。

You're like your head，Right，So you already know you have attraction，You can move on，Thanks。

 what do you got going for more than you look？，You're very pretty，You're beautiful eyes。

Can I touch them？，Oh， dirty fingers，Hold on， I'll take care of that，Better，So now。

 you've got indicators of interest from her，You're often to A3，I have a series of。

Or a sequence of events that takes place over and over again，This is called the bait，Hook，Real。

Release model，How do you know you're off into A3 when you try it and it works。

If you try it and it doesn't work，And then you're still in A2，You gave it a go， it didn't work。

You're not going backwards， you couldn't go forwards，You couldn't do A3 material。

So you're still in A2，In which case you're still gonna neg her，And you're still gonna do another。

Sorry， another demonstration routine，DHV demonstration of higher value。

Another story you're gonna throw in，And then you're gonna finally move back into A3 when you have a chance。

The main point in A3 is to make her say something，That you can give her IOWISFOR。

You're going to encourage her to demonstrate a higher value to you。

So you can then indicate your interest to her，It's literally the mirror opposite of A2，In A2。

 I'm demonstrating a higher value，And she's IOWIing me for them，In A3。

 she's demonstrating a higher value，And I'm IOWIing her for them，Okay，Bate， we're gonna bait her。

An example of that would be，What nationality are you？，What nationality are you？，If it hooks。

 she tells you，Cherman or whatever，You reel her in， a reel in is really an IOWI。

You reel her in with no way，I love German or whatever，Okay， oops， germ，I love German。

And then you release，I can't even talk to you now，And I'm reading text style，Bate， hook， reel。

 release，Over and over again，When nationality are you？，German， no way，Seriously you're German？。

Oh my god，Okay， I had this girl in high school，I had a crush on，She was German。

And I can't even talk to you now，Back to her，I learnt this particular method。

From an exotic dancer I was working，She said what's your occupation？，What do you do for living？。

And I said I'm a magician，And I said I'm a illusionist，She goes no way，I was a magician's assistant。

I'm like seriously，And she says yeah，I was your favorite magician，I go to Doug Henning。

And she goes that's mine too，Doug Henning is so much better than all the other magicians。

He's old school and it was just more natural，And she's just going off into it，I'm going，Oh my god。

 I love this girl，You know I feel so qualified，She's like I absolutely love magic。

And I love magicians，You're a magician，Oh my god and you're cute too，I can't even talk to you now。

Back turned to me，And I was like，Fuck，And I wanted to win her over，Because I felt validated。

Her IOI to me felt legitimized，Was a legitimate IOI，It wasn't a wow，You're hot，And to a girl。

You can't say you're hot，Because she gets it all the time，But to find you know。

To bait her with something，Another one I'll have is，What do you want to be when you grow up。

Don't say princess，I want to be an opera singer，Seriously an opera singer，You're teasing right。

No really，I went with the last time you sang，Yesterday you sang yesterday，You're fcking with me。

You sang yesterday，I love opera，Like what type of opera is it，Is it the old school stuff。

No it's like，You're in fcking，Holy shit I love you，I can't even talk to you now。

You're trouble for me，This is bad news，This is totally，I've revealed all my cards，Back turn。

Release you have to release it，If you're going to do an IOI。

It's going to make her feel uncomfortable，As you do a keynote，As you as you，Kinoescalate。

As you give her indicators of interest，So you have to give the，Kinoescalation。

Do the indicator of interest，And then take it away，Wait for her to come to you，And I just shut up。

Turn my back and they'll say，So where are you from，And I'm like，Next，And I'm back in，Right。

And I can move in，A3 is in many ways，A false qualifying，We want her to qualify herself to us。

And we reward her for it，Now a lot of people think，That's the time for。

You know really qualifying her，It is my contention，That you're not going to qualify her，For real。

In five fucking minutes，As she's into Britney Spears，And you're not。

You're not going to say no to her，She's a hot girl。

You know you can introduce her to your type of music preferences，Later，If she's your girlfriend。

Don't use this as your opportunity，You know，Hey she's got five minutes，And if not。

If she says she believes in something you don't believe，Then get rid of her，Don't do that。

The girl said，Do you believe in God，And I went，Well you know，If you mean by the，Patrearclical God。

Then no，But is something happening here，Look around，Something big is happening here，So I'm just。

You know I'm a very scientific minded person，So I've got great deal of skepticism。

Toward the supernatural，Considering I can move objects，So the power of my mind，Read people's minds。

Ben Metal predict the future，You haven't seen any of this stuff。

Because I'm not going to put it off into a workshop，But these are interesting topics，Okay，And。

Yesterday I think was，Compelling evidence to support that，I can still get girls，Without any magic。

You can swap out a magic trick，And swap in a story，It does the same fucking thing，You know。

As long as I'm doing my，Kinoescalation，As long as I'm doing my，Nags，You know。

And that's what progresses，It doesn't matter what story or a routine you use，Point is。

Some material can be used，In several different phases，And it is，It really can make a break。

Without it，Without a3，You can get instant buyers or more，You won't get next day buyers or more，Where。

If you go into comfort，And then go straight to seduction too fast，And your comfort escalation。

Kinoescalation is too fast，You'll get next day buyers or more，But you'll get instant buyers or more。

So where the girl feels validated by you，You know，Because you're in comfort，You start hitting on her。

You're arm and arm with her，And she didn't have to do anything，You don't even know her。

You didn't make her talk to you about herself，And then for sure to say something about herself。

So that you can get to know her，And like her for more than just her looks。

So the minute that she likes you，And the new start giving her IOIs，Because she gave you IOIs。

It's not enough，She'll feel validated，You know，She won you over，Just like she does every guy，And now。

You can leave，And that happened way too many times，So you need a3，I only do about 3 minutes of it。

Really it should be 7 to 10 minutes of it，However much is needed。

But also however much time you think you have，Because like let's say，They're at a restaurant。

And they're sitting down，And I've got about 8 minutes， Between they've just ordered their food。

They have their drinks，They ordered their food，I've got like 8 minutes before the food arrives。

8 to 10 minutes，So I've got a certain amount of time。

So I know that I'm going to have to compress my entire game to 10 minute period。

Or at least compress it all the way until they eat，And then when they're done eating。

I know I've got another 3 or 4 minutes， Maybe even 5 minutes there，At the end for the dessert。

But most people don't pick dessert，And when they get the check，They pay and go。

Or when they're paying，I can't be there，So right when they're finished eating。

And the waiter comes back，Would you like anything else，They say I'll just the bill，Then I can go in。

And I've got a few more minutes there，To finish up and get my time-bridge built，Or bounce them。

Bounce the whole group if necessary， Before I go off into a3，I forgot to mention。

There is an all-important question that I have to ask，Which goes，So，How do you all know each other？。

I have to ask this，Had you all know each other？，Had you all know each other？。

Had you all know each other？，Had you all know each other？，So，Had you all know each other？。

I have to ask，Every single set that you're ever going to go approach，If you get as far as a3。

It shouldn't be too much of a problem，It's 5 minutes in，3 to 5 minutes in，You're going to be saying。

So how do you all know each other？，You have to ask it，Because you don't know who the boy for。

And who the brother is，It's a necessary element in this game，You have to throw that in。

Now what happens if you go into a 2 set，And you say，So how do you all know each other？。

And the guy says，Oh this is my wife，I'm not going to quit there，I'll go one step further。

How long have you been married？，And I'll say that to her，Or if the guy says，This is my girlfriend。

I'll turn to her and say，How long have you been married？，I'm not married，I thought this is your，No。

I don't know，I'm an old，You're not a boy，You're just trying to get in，Good for you，That's good。

I just blown him out by doing that，Now I can work the girl，For him lying to me。

I'm going to steal his girl，Nothing personal，That's fair， isn't it？，You're lying to me。

I think you take draw，And the public，Exactly，Don't take，Exactly，Don't take your girl。

To a public gathering，Where she can be hit，Unmercelessly，Unless you're going to hold her，Hand。

 And put your arm around her，Make sure that she's yours，Show her，Show everybody that she's yours。

Make sure that she，Show us a two to you，If you don't have that type of， Relationship with her。

Do not take her out，To a public gathering，I think you're going to，I think you're going to。

Make sure that she's yours，So， bait hook，Release，Bat Hook，Release，I'll do this several times。

The idea is to， Encourage her to say something to me，I've got routines。

I'm going to teach it tomorrow，I want to call the music game，Where I say a song that I like。

and make her reply，We go back and forth，And every time she replies。

I get to either give her an indicator of interest， or an indicator of disinterest，And it escalates。

礼获，人生，身体，？，人生，剥幾百五，機技，是我就想我做壞了，大家接上座座號，時間如果，找到 пред uliybors，我很快，當k rolled，我們正在去，M Lisa，考iore。

因為這刷oting，中純陰liner， Those people，12% imagery，他的 Chef， Suddenly。

 Are you sure about that I'm here to share it with you？， oh， our， Heh， Will，我 tell friendley。

然後你你不是死定了，然後你的車車是不在追踏才可以，很简直，如果你当中的政治体就是，反正只有两种，我觉得是同学来，分享，但是连像来不熟悉的，我现在都有进入，各个非常重要的男子，对，而哪，第二 Coach。

OK，any time in a three，the reason why it will work。

any time in a three is because any time after a two， she's already attracted to you。

 and wants to redeem herself， because you're basically putting her down putting her down putting her down。

 befriending everybody by putting her down， disarming everybody by putting her down。

 lowering herself a steam and then saying， so how do you know each other， that's the first way point。

 and then at some point you're going to say， and this is another sound pipe， my。

 I've been alienating your kind of creepy friend here。

 is it okay if I talk to her for a couple of minutes。

 here grab this I'm going to show you something really cool if you're a good girl， come with me。

 we'll be over here， just come join us if you want to we'll keep the seat waiting for you guys。

 by saying that it， makes them feel more comfortable oh they can join at any time yet come join us。

 in a bit， now you take the girl and you do a handhold， I'm doing a keynote test。

 every single time I make a move on her， I'm testing I'm calibrating to see whether she's going to accept the move or not。

 she doesn't accept the mood I'll throw the hand off， that's it keep moving。

 that's the keynote escalation， it's very content continuously calibrated。

 every move that I make if I hear me your hand I want to find out where I'm at。

 is she holding my hand tight I'm going to let go， as I let go， does her hand pull away quick。

 or does she keep it there and are we finger， finger holding。

 and I'm leading her now through the crowd holding her hand， and it's on。

 if it feels good we're holding like this and like this。

 I'll open my hand again does it stay good and then we'll do one of these things。

 and now I'm holding the hand like this， walking， nice as I sit down。

 I know that I got her she's interested， now sit down and when I sit down I'll sit two feet from her。

 make it less comfortable for her， and wait because I know that she's going to reinitiate the chat。

 before I even bother showing her telling her what I was going to show her， I'll just sit there。

 and she'll and make her work basically make her， initiate the reinitiate the conversation。

 whenever a girl， whenever I put a pregnant pause in。

 for the girl it's an awkward pause for me it's a， it's a， specifically placed pregnant pause。

 if she reinitiates the chat with me， that's an indicator of interest。

 and I feel like I'm in control of it， grab a seat with her she's over here and I'll just sit and wait。

 so she'll say， so， where are you from？， now I'll tell you all about that in a sec。

 before I show you what I'm going to show you， I'm just curious about you。

 I mean I got to know your friends and they're all cool。

 first impression of you kind of suck now that I get to know you。

 there's something I'm curious about you there's something neat about you。

 what do you got going for more than you look， and I'm off into a three so I've done my move。

 sat down into a three now notice that I'm dangling something， in front of her。

 to make her go through a three I do this all the time。

 she comes into sits sits down with me where my C1 location because I'm about to go into my C1 phase。

 so I'm ready to go， okay， I do my a three stuff but I need to pull her through a three。

 bait hook release， I'm structuring loops hoops for her to jump through in a three I'm making。

 I'm baiting her to take the time to demonstrate a higher value to me。

 sometimes they won't jump through so I have to you know put the dangling carrot in front。

 you know put a little piece of weener hanging here。

 so that the cat will jump through through the hoop， often to C1。

 so I will say I'm going to show you something really cool， but before I do。

 what do you got going for more than you look， that's an actual sound bite that I use all the time。

 I'm going to show you something really cool but before I do。

 what do you got going for more than you look， and that's my that's right now the beginning of my a three。

 after I've done a move or an isolation， now I'm off now I've done that several times。

 I'm off into C1， now it looks like she's giving me， now you and I don't feel the difference。

 it looks a little different but we don't really feel the difference， for a woman though。

 any other woman in this room will feel more attraction for me， if a girl is gaming me。

 then if I'm gaming a girl， now why is that？， because， women are going to be attracted to a male。

 who is attractive to other， females， that's how that works， it's the boy band principal， think of。

 backstreet boys， the very first time that they did a video。

 they had a bunch of girls chasing them in that video， how is that possible？。

 it's the first fucking video， it's the boy band principal， and it works。

 another really good attraction mechanism is pre-selection。

 so it's the old experiment where you know they have this male grouse。

 and the females aren't mating with it that much， then they take a stuffed female。

 and put it next to the male， and suddenly he gets laid more all the other females are coming around。

 why？ because he's been pre-selected by another female， it's sort of lazy。

 they don't really evaluate the guy for themselves but other girls are， into him so， he has value。

 if you go out by yourself you can open sets and you can run sets if you're good。

 if you go out with the with the female pivot， sets will blow open。

 sets of girls will blow open when you go in with your pivot， and it's a lot easier to open the set。

 if you go out with two female pivots， they will come and open you， you'll be sitting there。

 yeah definitely， and then the bold ones will come in。

 they will come in and introduce themselves and try to get in on your set when you got your two girls。

 it's not it's not logical and it's definitely not。

 it's definitely not what you would hear in the popular culture。

 but girls are far more attracted to guys who have other girls。

 and they may not even admit it they may not even logically believe it。

 but we're talking about behavior which is mostly governed unconsciously anyway。

 and that's how people behave， anything that you can give her an eye a wife for， is um。

 you're the leader of your group aren't you？， yeah I can tell I like that about you。

 it's really attractive， this is a whole routine this little piece here okay， to say。

 when she's talking to you you know what you better go run along make some money before you piss your boss off。

 oh wait a sec you're your boss right， because they're freelance。

 so then by sitting here and talking to me or exercising your freedom to be your own boss。

 I like that that's really powerful， I just bought you three more minutes。

 for her to figure out that she's the boss she should be making money。

 you know she didn't come to chat， but it makes her feel good for shutting up and talking to you。

 you know for not working and talking to you instead， you know， which I really love， nice little bit。

 and you're rewarding her， you're giving an indicator of interest。

 for something that she has demonstrated， just by not saying a word， that's a nice， you know。

 a three routine， good for strippers especially， demonstrations of higher value。

 I think when you saw me， well just talking to you guys and I'm moving big like this。

 one girl walked by and， was kind of eyeing me， it happened because I'm talking to a group of guys。

 she may also have seen me with girls， when I was in that set with all those girls around me。

 didn't I look cool， not saying me but anybody any one of you。

 who would have been put in that position， where you can just keep them interested for that long。

 and hands on hands off， holding hands and all this stuff， I was out when I was having a blast。

 but to it looks really cool， to add to it all you guys were just quietly a bunch of guys。

 were quietly all surrounded， in the back， that was a huge set for me， and I'm just lean back。

 taken it all， all it takes is for any of those other women in that room， to see， I'm that guy。

 I'm not the observing， I'm the observed， you're either one of these two people。

 three hundred people come into a room， they're going to hang out all day long。

 waiting for someone else to do something， are they going to sit back and watch。

 or are they going to be one of those points of interest， that unfold in that club。

 you know two hot girls come in， that's a point of interest alone。

 just for them being hot and dolled up， two girls making out， that's an interesting thing。

 this guy having body shots over there with a girl， this girl and guy over here is making out。

 photos are taking place over here， hey can you take my picture， never grab the girl's camera。

 and take a picture of them， it lowers your value， you become one of those losers that they just tool。

 you have to do， you know they， say can you take a picture of me， no， please。

 I'd rather be an asshole about it， they can go you're an asshole， I am， but I'm fun。

 go get yourself a lackey， I'm just not going to， pull that off。

 because otherwise I'm taking pictures of them， they're like， thanks， we're going to go with that。

 oh by the way， did you， it's， chunky， it's false， what else do we have here， okay， DHV。

 so leading the men， leading the women， how do you lead the men in the women， stories。

 the stories can be non-sequitur， they can be just information。

 how many nights between one and a hundred， it's one example of a routine you can throw in。

 some routines， have to be， asexual， there has to be no sexuality in it。

 because you'll be telling these stories to guys， to guys， while I speak to you。

 my target can still hear what I have to say， thereby。

 conveying high value without appearing like I'm bragging， that's important。

 because if I start going hey you know where I'm from， I'm from Hollywood， where are you from。

 this is going to sound like bragging， but if I'm talking to one of the obstacles。

 and I'm shooting legs at the target， disarming the obstacle。

 making sure that no one thinks that I'm potentially after her。

 I have shut her down from giving me potential， protection shield stuff like boyfriend stuff。

 boyfriend objections， she's going to say boy， boyfriend。

 she will never say that she has a boyfriend to me， if I say okay hands off。

 which a turn Jesus Christ where's her off button， by saying that she's not going to give me any boyfriend objections。

 I have not， triggered her， her protection shield， and now that I've thrown the neck， I've also。

 you know disqualified myself from being a potential shooter from the eyes of the。

 obstacles so they don't feel threatened by my presence。

 now I can demonstrate a higher value by sequencing a series of， interesting stories。

 okay DLV is a demonstration of lower value， but these DLVs are actually DHVs。

 so for example let's say that I'm talking to some girls and I say。

 yeah I feel like I'm getting so fat lately， that's a DLV。

 I'm demonstrating lower value by saying that I'm fat。

 but it's really a DHV because what I've really sub communicated to her is。

 I'm not trying to impress you at all， it's like a neg。

 right when you neg like the quintessential neg is where you go into set and you blow your nose。

 okay I'm not insulting her， I'm not trying to make her feel bad。

 but I have just very definitively given her the feeling that I'm not trying to impress her。

 so that's what a neg is， so a DLV is very similar to that if I say yeah I feel like I'm getting so fat。

 I haven't insulted her， I haven't made her feel bad or made her think that I'm trying to make her feel bad。

 but she knows I'm not trying to impress her， well she believes she will honestly believe that I'm not trying to impress her。

 so that's what a DLV is， it's basically a false disqualifier that works like a neg。

 some people have demonstrations of lower value when a girl says so what do you do。

 and you say I'm an ass model， you're like ah no really what do you do， I work at Taco Bell。

 really what do you do， well I don't know you well enough， well guess what， you just lost it。

 you demonstrated lower value because you hesitated and you didn't get to answering it properly。

 and the answer that you had didn't convey high value， conveyed nothing， it's like a bunch of jokes。

 a one joke is funny， two jokes not so much， three jokes now you're hiding something。

 nice meeting you goodbye， examples of attraction locations， again， could be a mall， club。

 could be the street， but what will you notice about the mall， the club and the street。

 not very good at building comfort are they， that's why they're attraction locations。

 but what's good about them is a lot of people， a lot of opportunities for interaction， also a mall。

 you can find higher guns， a club you can find higher guns a street you can't。

 streets I don't like streets， personally， takes way too long to find your sets， but still a place。

 you know you're going to be out there anyway， and you can you can embed these。

 DHV spikes demonstration of higher value spikes right into a story， let's say a story begins here。

 time travels， three minutes long and it ends here， three minute long routine。

 you want to add these DHV spikes， no DLV spikes going down。

 little pits demonstrations of lower value， you want DHV spikes， what is DHV spike。

 what it's an example， I'll give you an example story， starting now。

 my last girlfriend up in Toronto before I moved to Hollywood， and then DeVegas。

 was an exotic dancer， don't be a hater， and she calls me， she's frantic。

 calling me saying baby baby， oh my god some of the my customers are chasing me。

 they're following me home， and I don't want them to know where I live， I'm trying to lose them。

 what do I do， I'm like well babe， calm down， stay on the line， first off， don't try to lose them。

 because you're only going to run into another car or something， a park car， relax。

 chill out as long as you know they're behind you， you're safe。

 you don't have to drive home just yet， stay on the line， now she had called me。

 just I had done a performance， I'm an illusionist， and I did a performance at。

 one of those high capacity clubs， it's called the government in Toronto。

 and I know the owner is a friend of mine， so he and some of my friends， and some of my friends。

 are back stage with me， and we're kind of created our little private VIP thing。

 going on and I get this call， I'm like Jesus Christ， I got a split， just sucked， but hey。

 just my girlfriend， I got a role， so my friends， I also feel fortunate， that I've got the loyalty。

 I've got loyal friends， and the loyalty is such that if I say， guys we got a role。

 they don't fucking question it， we just roll， and in return， if they said that to me， I'd roll。

 because they've done a lot of good for me， I've done a lot of good for them， we trust each other。

 you know， so I said guys， we gotta roll， no questions asked， we hop in the car， we're on our way。

 I'm keeping her calm， on the phone， ok， and here's what happened， let's pretend， this here。

 that's my car， and I'm driving along the road here， ok， we come to a four-way stop， her car's here。

 her driving here， ok， another car， the car in question，ún di Drôn，和怎样关键，三婷，他说他在对我的态度，因为他借了住缘。

I might be talking to a person，and she puts up a little hoop，Metaphorically speaking。

because she even wants to see if she can get me to jump into it，It's like a test，So what do I do？。

Do I jump into the hood？，No，Because if I'm constantly jumping into a hoop，Then she wins。

She has control of the frame，But and here's a principle，It's ok to jump into a hoop，如果你把他做完再次。

所以有一个例子，有多久我去，在一个人的房间，然后我去做一个，然后这个女生说，说什么，我做了一个人的问题，我做了一个问题，说什么，她就做了一个问题，她就做了一个问题，她就做了一个问题，她就做了一个问题。

她就做了一个问题，所以，如果我做了一个问题，她就做了一个问题，她就做了一个问题，所以 instead，我把他做一个问题，后来他转过来，然后我做了一个问题，然后我做了他回来，现在是这样。

所以我做了一个问题，然后我做了一个问题，然后我认为，他还在我外面，我认为，他还在我外面，他还在我外面，他还在我外面，他还在我外面，然后我就做了一个问题，然后 he'll do it again，对。

一种方向，另一个方向，这种方向，外面有些不需要准备，在其他人的方向，OK， Here's another example，Ghosts how old are you？，No。

 I could say 130， which I am， or I could say 28， which is what Mystery would say。

 And I've sort of jumped into a hoop， Now， it's not really a big hoop。

 It's not like I've just become a little tool， and she's got a dog collar on me。

 but I'm not going to say 30， It's pretty socially reasonable to just answer the question。

 and you could if you wanted to， But since I'm a player， I'm going to say guess。

 and she now lets say she's not willing to guess， and lets say she's like， I don't know， whatever。

 Well， I'm not going to play that game， but if I say guess and she says， 26， I say no。

 actually I'm 30， OK， so I say guess， that's a hoop， She jumps into it， Cool。

 she jumped into my hoop， Now I'll jump into her， I'll say OK， I'm 30， or live， I'm 28 or whatever。

 I would prefer 30， actually， because grossing to find older men more attractive。

 The older I tell them that I am， the more they want to hang out with me。

 it seems like it's kind of funny， So， let's say that I asked her， How old are you？。

 And she said guess， Now， now she sort of put it back on me， right？。

 So now what I would say is I would say， well， you want me to guess higher， guess low。

 She says guess low， and I say OK， you're 23， She says no， actually I'm 25， OK？。

 I'm just giving you an example， There's an example of frame games， going on back and forth， OK？。

 Now she says， if I say how old you and she says guess， I might just say OK， you're 25， OK？

 But understand what I just did， I just jumped into her hoop， without making her jump into one。

 So she says guess， I'm going to say， we don't mean to guess higher， guess low， She says guess low。

 23， no， actually I'm 25， Cool， OK， that's an example of where I always made her jump into a hoop。

 before I jumped into hers， Basically， what's happening now？， I'm not going to do that， Basically。

 what's happening now？， Basically， what's happening there is， she is not attracted to me。

 enough to jump into my hoops， If a girl is attracted to you， she will jump into your hoops。

 and she's not attracted to you， she won't jump into your hoops。

 And so what that's done is that's communicated to me that she's not attracted to me。

 or at least not enough to even jump into a little tiny hoop like guess， which is nothing hardly。

 So basically what that tells me is I'm still in A2， I'm not in A3 yet， OK， In A2。

 a lot of the frame control that you do in A2， is just not being tooled by other people， You know。

 an AMOG comes up and tries to tool you， and you're unaffected， a cool man， whatever， So anyway。

 last week my friends and I were blah blah blah， See how he comes in and tries to frame on me。

 and I'm like you just unaffected and I brush them aside， That generates a lot of attraction。

 It's very attractive to women， to see a guy win this sort of frame game。

 So it's almost just offensive， It's not being tooled by other people， But in A3。

 you are actively trying to hoop on other people， You're trying to pull them into your frame。

 So it's more offensive。
