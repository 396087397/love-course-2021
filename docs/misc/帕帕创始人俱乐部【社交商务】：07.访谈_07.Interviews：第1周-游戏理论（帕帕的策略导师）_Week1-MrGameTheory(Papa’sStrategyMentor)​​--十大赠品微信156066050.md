 quantify feelings，， a billion units of pleasure， and a billion units of pain。， And obviously。

 the way academics， will analyze feelings is it's very complex，， you know。

 system that we're talking about here， and you can't reduce it down to some quantifiable unit，。

 but what the hypothesis essentially states that is， if we were somehow able to reduce it down，。

 you would really come down to two，， you know， types of units， of measurements。

 and you can call it anything you want，， but all feelings are comprised of a different combination。

 of different feelings。， That's essentially how we would have to exist。

 for the hypothesis to be valid。， And so， you know， the model essentially creates，， you know。

 this system that would have to exist， for this， you know， model to be valid。。

 What's your inspiration and reason for developing this。

 and writing the book and having such a passion for this topic？， You know， just motivation， right？。

 Maybe it was time for the world to hear。， Maybe， you know， I needed it， you know， who knows？， But。

 you know， I analyze the world，， I've played over a thousand games in my life。

 and just analyzing various systems。， I looked at the life that we all live and I say，， okay。

 you know， life is pretty complex。， No one seems to have figured out the answer。。

 There's all these various religions。， What religion is right and we're all caught up。

 in this religions right or this one's right， or no religions right。。

 There are academics who have no religion at all， but somehow， you know， just studying religion，。

 studying their field of interest，， that's all they need in life。， And I was thinking， what could be。

， if I was creating a perfect system，， how would I design it？， And I would say。

 I would incorporate a rule like this。， So， no matter what happens，， no matter where you're born，。

 you have this line of protection， that the system is designed to ensure。

 that no matter what happens，， you will be protected， and how you're protected is through motivation。

， So， let's say you're driving in your car，， you have two restaurants to choose from。

 and you spontaneously choose to go to one instead of the other。。

 It's at these unique moments of motivation kicking in， and we all think。

 I have full control over myself， but the reality is motivation， is outside of our control。。

 Some people， you know， they've mastered their motivation。

 but the reality is they have a very strict schedule， and they happen to have a balanced life。， So。

 as a result， they have control over， their motivation because they're gonna be doing。

 these actions anyway。， And so， you know， you think，， oh， I can just force torture on myself。

 and then I'll never dial the forever。， But the hypothesis essentially says。

 you will lose the motivation eventually， to stay on that path。， So， motivation is， you know。

 the secret variable， in this equation and， you know，， as I was analyzing how life could be fair，。

 this model essentially just designed itself，， just logically breaking down how we would have to exist。

， So， I just drilled down on it and it was a fun idea， and I just started taking it more seriously。

 then I decided to go out， speak to academics， to see if it was this ridiculous or crazy， and。

 you know， stupid and wasted my time。， And as I started sitting in front of more professors，。

 the smartest people who are teaching， you know，， are in society。。

 I realized none of these guys really have proof， or a validated example that conflicts with this。

 without a reasonable doubt。， And I just started getting more pumped up for it。

 and just a natural curiosity that led me to it。， I think that beliefs like， for example，。

 in our client base or our students will teach them。

 that you need to believe that anything is possible，。

 that your skill sets with the girls will lead to success。， If you really believe in yourself，。

 you could get the girl。， If you believe in your game， that's really good。

 that you're more likely to get the girl。， And if soreness to take this belief that，。

 if you're feeling a lot of suffering， or over abundance and pleasure and not enough。

 and that pain that you might get from my work， or suffering or have you，。

 how are these principles and belief systems， actually help an application？， Sure， I mean。

 I would say this，， do what you can control， work hard，， set a schedule for yourself。

 that provides you with surplus suffering each day， in a manageable way。， And then have focus。。

 If you wanna be able to pick up girls，， if you wanna be able to make more money，。

 if you want to accomplish certain goals，， stay focused and try your hardest to reject。

 immediate gratification，， a reject pleasure from outside areas。

 and just stay focused on what the goal is。， And when you finally accomplish that goal，。

 then you will allow pleasure in。， So hard work， just like everyone will tell you，。

 look at religions。， They're all saying some other things。。

 They're saying abstain from certain activities。， A lot of those activities happen to give you a lot of pleasure。

， And repent， do certain actions that balance out， your excess pleasure。。

 And all religions are pretty much teachings，， but they say it in different way。。

 They have different doctrines，， but they're really delivering the same message。， And even work。

 even societies are structured， around this principle。， So knowing that， use that to your advantage，。

 knowing that the system as a whole， has to keep everyone fair，， determine what your goals are，。

 write down what your goals are。， That's the first thing。。

 Have focus on what you want to accomplish in life。， Because if you don't have focus，。

 then you're just letting in pleasure from everything。。

 So then that secret goal that you've always had， always stays without reach，。

 because you never had that surplus reserve of suffering， to pay for that pleasure。

 that you would experience if you accomplished that goal。， So my suggestion is。

 stay focused and work as hard as possible。， If you're sitting in the gym and you have the same routine。

 and you're just doing the reps， and you're not really suffering anymore，， and you realize， well。

 I'm plateauing。， I really not seeing results。， The reality is， because you're not suffering anymore。

， So you look at Arnold Schwarzenegger， and you look at all of these characters。

 who have accomplished their goals， and they actually are saying similar thing。， Work your butt off。。

 Don't start counting pushups and still starts hurting。， That pain is what actually matters。。

 That's when the clock counts。， There's a reason why they're saying it，， because the reality is。

 it's when the pain kicks in， that you start accruing that suffering。。

 And then you can go out and spend it on whatever you want，， whether it's hot girls。

 whether it's on family，， whether it's on helping society，。

 whatever way you can get your pleasure from。， If you look at a lot of the belief systems。

 of people whether they're falling in religion，， we were falling in general self-improvement principle。

 from like a guru， like Stephen Covey or someone else。。

 They have all sorts of ideas and they adopt these beliefs。， And some of them may just be based upon。

 being a hypothesis as well。， How are them believing in this help their lives？， It may not。。

 Some people go crazy when they hear this。， As ridiculous as that sounds。， I mean。

 the thing that this exists， is actually pretty terrifying thought。。

 The only thing I can say to you is this。， You have to， instead of getting so focused， on the theory。

 until we can quantify it，， it's not going to be validated。。

 So there's always going to be that doubt。， So instead of sitting around saying，。

 this is nonsense or this is right，， perform actions that better your life。。

 And what I recommend is hard work， and abstaining from pleasure。

 that doesn't contribute to accomplishing your goals。， Stay focused on what your goals are。。

 And that's it。， I mean， I don't have your life。， Every person has a different life， different goals。

， As a person， you have to decide， what truly matters to you， and then cut the rest out。。

 Sometimes human beings feel the motivation， to engage in certain activities， and they don't realize。

， well， why did I do this？， This was so stupid，， but they learned a valuable lesson。。

 So let's say they accrued a certain amount of suffering， from engaging in that mistake。。

 But what they don't realize is maybe 80 of those mistakes。

 and all the suffering from that added together， was enough to buy in to accomplishing that goal。。

 So you paid your entry fee into it。， So it's kind of like lay away。， Most people。

 they're putting in a little bit of suffering， each day into an activity。

 and then 10 years or two years， or 40 years down the line， it finally happens。

 because they've been socketing away。， So just because you're experiencing suffering one day。

 doesn't mean you will experience an equal ratio， of pleasure that same day。， Some human beings。

 they can go years before they get balanced。， And just because your balance doesn't mean that you die。

， it just means that they're constantly intersecting，。

 you're constantly have a surplus of one or the other。， And my recommendation is just do your best。

 to keep the suffering as high as possible。， Now your people are thinking，， oh。

 maybe I'll just cut myself， or maybe I'll just torture myself。。

 I believe that people who do that are penalized， in some way or another and the cells can die。。

 The system itself， if you really want to reduce this down，， it starts getting a little ridiculous。

 but you actually have to start analyzing， on a cellular level。， Does this just apply to humans？。

 And technically speaking， maybe it doesn't apply， to all living creatures。， Well。

 does it apply to animals？， Does it apply to multicellular organisms？， How about single cell？。

 So maybe it has something to do with DNA。， Maybe this isn't some magical theory。。

 Maybe DNA itself is designed this way， and motivation is this internal structure in DNA。。

 And you don't have to have a supernatural force。， Or maybe there is some supernatural force。

 that plays a part。， At this point， I couldn't tell you，。

 but all I can say is do what you can control， and that is hard work。， Well。

 a lot of people who do hard work will suffer， through that。。

 So I view it as sort of a healthy suffering。， As you know， you go to a marathon，。

 you're doing long distance training，， you have that suffering。， At the same time。

 you can also suffer， just by being around the wrong kind of crowd。， And a lot of what we talk about。

 is trying to surround yourself with the people， that are actually contributing value to your life。

 and that positivity to your life。， Yet you have to make a choice if this theory is true。

 about how your actions are going to affect you。， So what say that you surround yourself。

 with a lot of positivity，， the right kind of people and what have you？。

 Is your theory going to negate any of that， or is it going to not affect it？。

 Like how is things going to turn out？， So technically speaking， there is no loophole。。

 There's no way to break this。， Every human being who's ever died。

 in the history of the planet has died feeling neutral。。

 So the best way that I can say to think about it， is look at your life， look at what matters to you。

， Don't get sidetracked by too many things。， Do instead of being some wild person。

 and some people they get their pleasure from it， and they have a personality that's uniquely congruence to that。

， I would say stay focused。， Don't be distracted by anything。， I would say for you specifically，。

 if you want to go out there and pick up girls，， if you want to go out there and have happiness，。

 know that there's going to be a cost to it。， There's no trick that will make it so you get。

 to have excess pleasure。， If you're going out there， you're being positive， with a group。。

 Let's say you surround yourself with positive people， all the time。， Technically speaking。

 the theory says， maybe you had to suffer for five years。

 before you got into that positive environment。， Maybe you spent $10，000 and for you，。

 accruing that $10，000 took a lot of blood sweat and tears。， Maybe your family is torturing you。。

 And as a result， you surrounded yourself， in a positive circle。。

 But there is no person who's ever existed， that has that positive circle，， has the money。

 has no family drama。， Everyone's getting drama from someplace。。

 So you can go out and surround yourself， with positive people。， I think that's a great thing。。

 I mean， world pieces go into a curve， when essentially everyone can remove the conflict。

 and there's harmony among human beings。， If people can learn to get all the suffering internally，。

 then they don't have to get suffering externally。。

 If I'm able to provide all the suffering on myself， through exercise and dieting and working hard，。

 then I don't need to get the suffering， from you or another human being。， And suddenly。

 I have a personality， that attracts positive people，， that attracts a fun environment。。

 Because life has to be fair。， And all that hard work that I've done internally， has paid off。。

 And now I'm surrounded by a positive group。， Now， I finally learned what it takes to be a good person。

， But the reality is，， you didn't get to that point where you learned that valuable lesson。。

 That idea of maybe it's a personality change that you made。， But that was such a powerful idea。

 that there was a cost to it。， So you had to suffer or you had to go through drama。

 before you were allowed to have that inspiration and idea。。

 That idea just magically popped into your head。， When ideas just pop into your head，。

 there is method to the madness of it。， I do feel like there's always in terms of learning something。

， There's going to be a struggle。， There's going to be issues where，。

 in terms of picking up girls or mean people，， you'll get rejections。， Same thing in business。。

 Same thing in any social interaction。， A lot of what we talk about is trying to reframe those negative things。

 as just reference experiences and views。， Now， in terms of like the suffering，。

 are you talking about actually choosing to feel the pain of that suffering。

 or eventually you're just going to start viewing things differently。

 or are you talking about it in the sense that， you have to feel bad things。， You say。

 seek that suffering。， But is there like a healthy suffering that you're trying to suffer？。

 So if you get shot in the leg，， but you're in shock and you don't actually experience pain，。

 you're technically engaged in something that was supposed to be bad。， But yeah。

 you didn't feel anything。， So it all comes down to the actual feelings that are experienced。。

 So some people， they need to fail a lot， and they feel bad when they're failing，。

 but whether they realize they're not，， they're accruing this suffering。， So some people。

 they need to experience that rejection，， that pain in order to build up to them。。

 They learn the lessons，， finally， but what really is happening is when they learn that lesson，。

 they have so much surplus suffering that they can go the rest of their life，。

 experiencing satisfaction from interaction with other people。， So in your program，。

 you're teaching guys to，， and women， to go out there and，， just accept rejection。。

 It's a natural part of life。， Just roll with the punches。， Eventually it's going to come。。

 Stay focused， stay committed，， and eventually will come。， And there is truth to that。， However。

 if you're in a program like this，， and you're working hard to try to pick up girls，。

 but you're not making other lifestyle changes as well，， well， there's no free happiness in life。。

 So you're going to have to choose to maybe give up something。

 on a daily basis that's giving you pleasure。， If you're watching three hours of TV each day，。

 there's a lot of pleasure from that。 Maybe you sacrifice the TV for three hours。， Some people。

 they sacrifice TV for the internet。， So now instead of getting pleasure from their favorite shows that they watch as a kid。

， they're getting it from Facebook。 So it was replaced。。

 So sometimes you have to replace sources of happiness and sadness。。

 Maybe for some reason you're always in abusive relationships，。

 and you keep finding these abusive relationships for some weird reason，。

 even though it defies probability。， But what you don't realize is you've kept your life the exact same。

， And so it's always this stable harmony that you're seeking，， whether you realize you're not。

 your motivation is seeking you to stay in this balanced environment。。

 So you keep replacing one relationship with the next。。

 And then there's this honeymoon phase of pleasure。。

 But then it has to balance out by fighting and torturing at the end。， Some people。

 they suffer so much from work that they don't have to worry about。

 suffering from their significant other。， So for your guys out there that are grinding to learn the，。

 and master picking up， you know， people of the opposite sex，。

 they have to make some choices about their overall life。。

 They should look at their life and see where they're getting their current pleasure。。

 If every time they have a meal， it's some gluttonous， delicious snack，。

 then whether they realize they're not，， they're balancing on a ton of suffering in each one of those meals。

， Maybe instead of getting pleasure from food，， you take a few weeks off and you eat things that you know are healthy。

 or you know that you're not really getting satisfaction from。。

 Now you've removed the source of pleasure。， So going into your training。

 now maybe they'll finally hit that success faster。， So， you know。

 stay focused on what your goals are。， There's little ways that the universe tricks you into getting pleasure。

， You know， whether it's just food， whether it's hanging out with specific person。。

 If my next-door neighbor is moving and I help them carry a box up， you know， stairs。。

 But she's very attractive person and I'm really enjoying the experience to hang out with them。。

 Well， even though I'm helping them， even though I'm carrying a heavy box，。

 I'm getting enough satisfaction from the experience to edit up。， Even though I did a good deed。

 it ended up providing me with surplus pleasure， that I'm going to be half the pay for later on。。

 So if you're going out and doing charity work，， you know。

 do something that helps that you're really not getting satisfaction from， and sounds kind of crazy。

 but you know， assuming this philosophy is， you know， true。， You know。

 you have to stay focused on where you want to experience your pleasure。。

 And as long as you feel the motivation to stay committed to it， you know，。

 there's a reason why it exists and you just have to stay on it。， Well。

 if you look at the pursuits of most people， it's usually about pursuing happiness。。

 As you can see from most stories， most movies， most fairy tales，。

 everyone's trying to pursue that happy life。， Now。

 when you're theory are you saying that it's something that you might try to pursue still。

 or is there like any cons to do that？， Is there trying to people want to pursue a different kind of life？

， Sure。 I mean， some people pursue money， right？， But when they finally get money， it tortures them。。

 So we pursue things all the time and they may or may not be good for us。， You know。

 if you have the impulse that you want the pleasure from a sexual relationship， or just， you know。

 a loving relationship or a friendship，， whether you realize they're not and it's sad to say this，。

 but every time you're enjoying it， if this theory is valid，。

 then you are subtracting from your suffering pool。， You know。

 you have to decide what relationships really truly matter to you as a person。， So I would say this。

 though， you're going to get certain life experiences， by engaging in certain environments。。

 If by interacting with， you know， pick trying to pick up enough women，。

 you may gain certain valuable skills that give you confidence that， you know，。

 transfers over to work life in other areas。， But at the end of the day， technically speaking。

 if you're getting a pleasure， from engaging in certain activities， there's going to be a cost to it。

， One of the things that I found in most people，， I'm the most successful and happiest people I know。

， is that they've all had a lot of common things。， Some of them had to work really hard。

 some of them kind of hard backgrounds，， they had learned from it。

 and regardless of whether or not this theory is accurate， or true。

 I just found it fascinating because so many people that I know。

 will more likely remember those times of pain and won't know how to actually deal with it。。

 I think it's crazy that we live in a world where people will end up losing all hope。。

 And I think that things like this just show that there could be possibilities。

 for fairness and what have you。， I mean， you may have had a horrible experience today，。

 and you don't realize how you could ever recover from it。， You go to sleep， you wake up。

 and for some reason it's not so bad。， You've learned to cope with that environment。。

 And so we have this natural tendency to cope with our environment。， So， if you're suffering a lot。

 things are going really bad for you。， Around the corner， it could be finally you reach that，。

 and now you get to withdraw from it， and the pleasure of this life。， And stick with it， I would say。

， If you have a goal or a dream， try your best to not indulge。， And stay focused on it。， I mean。

 if you're sitting in this program， and you truly want to find that significant other，。

 you truly want to engage sexually with a bunch of hot girls。， I would say to you。

 if that's what makes you happy， and that's who you are，。

 and you'll have human beings out there who are completely against that，。

 but the unique thing about this planet is we all get our happiness from scenarios。。

 Certain people get happiness hating on other people。， That's just how they are。

 They are the trolls of the world that people call them。， Some people。

 they get happiness protecting other people。， We all get that happiness from some place。。

 But if you're here and you're committed to getting that happiness from the opposite sex，。

 let's say we're the same sex， I would say， just work your butt off to do it。， Great， well。

 on the final note， it's one to end with anything that you want to share。

 as lessons or things that you've learned from studying and building this research。

 to create this awesome book。， And I'm going to share with all of our community， this book，。

 so that they could also read in more detail if they're interested in pursuing it deeper。， You know。

 I would say first and foremost， this hypothesis has not been scientifically validated。。

 So before you go off and accept this as a fact of life， which some people have done，。

 just know that it has not been validated。， I would say that you figure out what your goals are in life。

， That's really the most important thing。， You know， you can almost think of life as a game，。

 and this is just one of those rules， protection， a law， fairness， assuming it was ever validated。。

 And you know， it should give you some comfort that there is something that created this。。

 If this exists， let's assume that this exists。， That's a very interesting thing to exist。， That。

 you know， let's put it like this。， If let's say 500 years from now。

 we have the technology to create a perfect simulation。。

 And we knew for a fact that the things inside of that simulation were feeling pain and pleasure，。

 because we programmed those things to feel pain and pleasure。。

 They'd probably be some kind of lobbied group that would say，， all right。

 you guys have now created this technology。， These things are feeling， you have to protect them。

 because it would just be not right。， If they， if some were just absolutely can be captured and tortured to death and sit for 50 years。

， you know， having needles being stuck in them every day， you know， in agonizing pain，。

 and they're not coping to the environment。， So we're creating this rule and essentially all else revolves around it。

， So personalities， the way that it works is this。， So do we have free will at all？， Well。

 technically speaking， as long as this rule is being upheld，。

 our brains allow us to essentially have wiggle room， right？。

 Like it doesn't necessarily mean that our destinies are chosen for us。。

 As long as the law is followed，， we can experience pleasure in all sorts of unique ways。， You know。

 we have the motivation to protect us in those unique circumstances，， but for the most part。

 we have free reign。， You know， if we choose to eat a dish restaurant over this one，。

 it's not going to be that much of a big difference in the grand scheme of things。。

 And so we have the freedom to choose up into the point where we break this rule。， So， you know。

 there's some， it feels good to know assuming this is vow that that exists。， And， you know。

 we can go off and experience amazing things。， But at the end of the day， technically speaking，。

 if everything that's ever lived follows this rule，， then， you know。

 what was the benefit of living over things that never had a chance to become alive？， And so， that。

 essentially， within this hypothesis， the universe is fair。。

 Because whether you actually got to live or not，， you know。

 you never experienced surplus satisfaction or pleasure from living。， And so， you know， it's a very。

 you know， interesting idea when you really break it down to that，。

 in regards to the overall fairness of not just life， but the universe。。

 Our company has always been based upon application as opposed to theories。， And yet。

 at the same time， this is one of those theories that really captivated my interest。。

 Because there are so many things that could be implied from this，， and learned from this。

 regardless of the truth and theory。， And yet， at the same time。

 there's been a lot of studies that make it appear that there could be a lot of truths to this theory。

， A lot of the lessons of hard work and lessons in terms of，。

 learning from your failures can be learned from this as well。， Anyway。

 thanks a lot for the interview。 It was awesome having you here。 Cheers。， Cheers。
