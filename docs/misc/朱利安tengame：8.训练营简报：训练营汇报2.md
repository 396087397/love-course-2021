有把折� hack you want，在 Sweet radio usually want the only way to get it。

 because an japanese 02 song is reserved to do something that will attract it， Ok。

 it's by doing something else， you get that outcome as a bipartisan product of doing it。

 So on a By rulver set， on a macro level， Suicide success with women， how do you get women。

 by entering yourselves as a person， by you doing that， focusing on action that's in your control。

 women come as a bipartisan product， When I go out to a club， And say to me like，Where is the girl。

 where's the girl， How do I get a girl，远长大学华国会社会有非常高点，她当股王庙大学，华国会社会副动作，他紧张，所详细小时，很 bustaby，要嘗試，我只可以。

 instead of doing it，you keep her there for longer period of time，it's horizontal。

you're be only goal during time，it's like women are like a waiting mobile，if you let emotions do it。

is te goal is to focus on logistics，or getting her in a situation。

whereyou can then proceed vertically，and conflicts，so remember a lot of quests。

 we cop up in like more and more more，j， vueltery motions would keep herin ms，and keep herin ms。

 whay，the matter of the emotions，the matter normalmente， thereok，that do focus on isolation。

刚刚我按了一个要命，�CC是出身的，类型，刚才这只班我们通常都集团，只能说筛户游戏老亲， mid 河 Contact podcast 他哦，参与我的記憶，这真的是跟 reported 监控。

感觉留着不及一次，但其实轻轻张的，有些人有可能的事，有些事，这就是 why a lot of guys， fuck up too， because they get the girl。

 track did， but there's no way to， at some point you reach a， ceiling because of the， environment。

 and then she's like， and then it stagnates， and it dies， yeah， be careful of being。

 like the make out grinding， guy， don't be make out guys， yeah， you can do it though。

 and but usually I do like， a little burst of it， and then I'll keep it going， yeah。

 so that's a big one， so don't forget so， much in gaming， it's like getting the habit。

 it's more like endurance， like long sets， longer sets， keeping under that same， state。

 and the other one too， is remember why you're， there， it's like don't be ashamed， of putting those。

 intentions out there， because that's also a big， source of trying to be， funny and exciting。

 it's your kind of， compensate like， hey like me， because I like you， and you're kind of。

 afraid of me， like I want to fuck you， type of vibe， you know， and it's similar to。

 you know they talk about， like in sales， if you're if you're there， to sell say like on a。

 on a stage or something， you're not there to make， the crowd laugh， you're there to make them， buy。

 if they're laughing， what are they not doing， buying， you're not there to be， the clown。

 same with the girl， you're not there to， make her laugh， and entertain her， night。

 you're there to fuck her， if she's laughing， what is she not doing， suck in your dick。

 you're not there to make， her laugh， you're there to make， it suck your dick， a lot of the fun。

 or niceness， we think it's genuine， but in reality， it's insecurity， to avoid having to deal。

 with like putting that， out there， and the potential， tension that it can create， so on one hand。

 you to progress， lead to sensitize， yourself， and mean fully， okay， like letting that。

 tension build， like straight up， like I like you， and this hold it， there， like full on。

 and she'll be like， like you're going to， counter that， polarity， and don't break the， tension。

 because that's kind of， one of the reasons， to it's like you， lit the pension， they're like。

 yes to do to do， to keep the fun going， it's like no， it's like mafia， boss， gorilla， I like you。

 silent ice， okay， so it's like solely， kind of getting used， to that vibe， don't avoid the tension。

 desensitize， yourself to it， and number， three， you need to know， what value。

 you're bringing to the table， and this is big， especially when， pulling， everything's in exchange。

 if you for example， don't feel fully， at ease， putting yourself out there， oftentimes。

 or say pulling the， trigger， and you might have， experiences say， when you ask for a number。

 sometimes， there's a little pressure， and you feel a little， sleazy， or a little guilty， sometimes。

 you're like， oh it's number， times， like that， or it's time to pull， you know， it's like。

 it's not as fun， and carefree， is when you're joking， around， and that there， usually it's。

 because you don't know， what value， you're bringing to the table， so what value。

 are you bringing to the table， what is the girl， getting a get out， of fucking you， how are you。

 going to positively， impact her life， what are the benefits， if you don't know， no wonder。

 it's hard to put， yourself out there， because， if you don't know， then the only thing， is like。

 you're just focused， on what you can take， and then of course， you are going to feel， sleaze。

 you're going to feel， like compensating， by fun， because that's the way， you view it， it's like。

 I have nothing to give， but I can take， all this validation， it's x and huggers。

 what is she getting， out of it， okay， and this is something， I'd recommend you do， like， basically。

 say tomorrow， something like， sit down， and write a huge list， of all the benefits。

 and it could be small， ones to big ones， you know， like even stuff， like good sex， there's one。

 say you're into personal， developments， that'll rub off， on her life， she can apply those concepts。

 it'll affect her work， it'll affect this， it'll affect that， to to to to to to， good time。

 I'll show her my experiences， so bring her into my passion， shoulder this， like。

 the bigger the list， the better， and the reason I say， write it out， is it forces you to be precise。

 it's precise as possible， so when you walk up， to that girl， even off the open， you know what she's。

 getting out of it， and it's all longer， sleazy， trying to swoop in， or trying to compensate。

 with fun， entertainer mode， it's like， hey， you know， that's what also， allows you。

 even kind of relax， and feel entitled， not so attached， because there's not， that sleaziness。

 you're not taking， you're， giving the benefits， now you know， this， she doesn't know that。

 and because that， it's your job to， lead her to the benefits， and in reality， the bad thing to do。

 or the thing， that you should feel， guilty about doing， is not leading her， to the benefits。

 you know， this will happen， sometimes with newbies， they start opening， and then they get you， soon。

 the crazier crazier thing， and then they can't， slow down， and connect at all， it's like。

 how many girls， did you actually， connect with， yesterday， actually knew， about who you were。

 on a deep level， you were fun， some girls might have， liked it， oh this guy was funny。

 but there's nothing， that generated， out of that conversation， I want the generative， conversation。

 it's like when you， you know， talk to your friend， and like， it's one of those。

 two types of conversations， and then some other， and you probably， all experience this。

 with a close friend， usually have a couple， drinks and， sometimes you just get， open up so on。

 so forth， there's a deep， fucking bond， something comes out， at that conversation。

 do that with girls， and how do you do that， in an environment， like yesterday， has it。

 don't get sucked into， the environment， remember， you don't have， don't react to the environment。

 it's okay to slow down， it's okay to be low， energy， she gets sucked into， your vibe。

 on the dance floor， I'll never usually dance， I'm just like， hey how's it going。

 taking that pressure off， like identifying the， pressure， like I want all of you。

 to do this a bit tonight， like， you're all going to feel， like like ten set times。

 and it could be attached， to the outcome， find out where the， pressure is coming from。

 say you fall back， into the fun thing， it's like oh shit， my falling back to the， fun thing。

 is it what I want to do， or is it because， there's a certain， pressure， am I running towards a。

 running away from， something， and this solely， identifying it， same for all you guys。

 and I want a few， reasons we can break， down tomorrow， but for you tonight， I'll kind of monitor。

 and if I see it， I'll slow you down， and we'll like， kind of get into practice， of bringing out。

 that realness， that'll be a lot， scary or funny enough， and it's one of the， situations to。

 where you can't， keep doing the crazy thing， because you're just， keep banging your head。

 against the wall， it's like taking， that step back， and like， walking around， so it's like slowing。

 it down a bit， also having longer， interactions， letting the tension， naturally build， instead of。

 spiking it， with fun， and kind of getting， some actual proof， that the girl can， like you for as a。

 person， versus the funny， stuff or the crazy， things you say or do。， The key is never， avoid it。

 because then that's， when you turn into， kind of like， people pleasing， that's when you compensate。

 by fun， or compensate by this， and you play， more so not to lose， versus playing to win。

 and a big thing， is accepting that， those situations， will arise， and instead of avoiding， it。

 it's more so， progressively， desensitizing， yourself to it。， It's like， baby stepping。

 your way there， in a， in more like， controlled situations。， So that's why I say。

 building the endurance， muscle。， It's like in the， long interactions， you have that little， dip。

 and at first just， survive a little， longer than a little， bit longer than a。

 little bit longer than， a little bit longer than， at ease， because you'll never， get rid of， them。

 especially in， terms of rising， and value。， If your guys， like high value in a， club，。

 girls are going to， stare you guys， are going to， stare you they're， going to judge you。

 in a good way， or bad way。， Both， there's going to be， a lot of pressure， and it kind of comes。

 with the territory。， So by， avoiding it，， you're always， going to have， like this success。

 barrier that you， won't be able to pass。， So it's so it's， so it's not， being like。

 totally retarded， with it and be， like like crazy， things。， It's also， in a smart， controlled way。。

 Baby stepping， your way there。， We all have the， pressure to， like make every girl， like us。。

 Or we have， pressure to not， get rejected。， No， on one hand， there， you have to。

 realize that you're， going to get， rejected forever。， Because that's just， human nature。。

 That's how， it's supposed to be。， You know， if you， meet someone new，， there's some people。

 you get along really， well。， Some other people， you don't。， Did they do， anything wrong？， No。

 just that， there's no， connection。， It's the same with， girls。， That's natural。， So by trying to。

 make every girl， like you，， it's not realistic， and too。， It's coming from the， ultimate people。。

 Please are， framed。， So instead， the way I， view it is like，， I don't， try to make every。

 girl like me。， That was never the， goal。， I'm totally fine。， Like no， matter what I do，。

 some girls are， not going to like me， no matter what they do。， Some girls are not。

 going to like them。， Then you have to， question too。， Why do you need， everyone to like you？。

 Why is it so bad， if they don't like you？， What are you， running away from？， Because we're all。

 running away from， something。， If you get to the， root of it， a few of， them is fear of being。

 alone。， We think， oh， if， people don't like， me， then there's this。， And then I'm alone。。

 Then I'm fear of， banning fear of， isolation and being， outcast or fear of， being a bad person。。

 People judge me， if I do something， that's bad and get， rejected， that means I'm， bad。。

 So on and so forth。， And then you have to， question too。， Like the fear of being， alone。。

 What's so bad about， being alone？， Why do you need a， girl？， Why are you now？， Why are you not。

 enough？， And it's coming to， terms that you are， enough。， And then you get the。

 girl not because you， need to， but because you， want to。， And in case it makes。

 sense to kind of take the， interaction that you're， having on a higher， level。， But it's like。

 I need， her there。， And then once you kind of， get to that point there，， that's when you're nice。

 to become a fun too， because， the pressure is gone。， And in a way， that's， what we're all chasing。。

 It's like ways to feel， at ease or be happy。， Like even there， it's like， you don't necessarily。

 want all the girls to， like you。， The reason you want， that is if they all， like you， you can。。

 I made it。， I can finally relax and， feel happy now。， If I fuck a hundred， girls， all my friends。

 will approve。， That means I'm cool。， Or I can tell myself I'm， cool。， But in reality， we're not。

 even chasing the girls。， Just chasing that。， Oh， finally。， It's like I don't have to， keep chasing。。

 I don't have the， pressure。， But the key here is， kind of questioning it， into the other way around。

， It's like when I go out，， again， that's that whole， thing I'm not even， caring。， You're just like。

 it's， okay。， You get rejected。， It's okay。， It's okay。， And then it's like， you。

 slowly start generating。， It's like people judge， you。， It's okay。， You look retarded。， It's okay。。

 Because otherwise， there's， all these goals you need to， love up to。， I need to look cool。。

 I need to do this。， I need to do this。， I need to do this。， I need to kill you。。

 How would you act if you， knew you were going to， fuck a ten at the end of， the night？。

 Because a lot of that， stress is you're trying to， get the girl。， You're trying to do well。。

 What if I told you you， already did well？， How do you act？， At 3am， you're going to， pull a ten。。

 When you care if you're， going to fall in love with， all the pressure。， So a lot of that chasing。。

 And funny enough， you act， as if you're going to， fuck the ten， it'll become， a self-fulfilling。

 prophecy and you'll get the， ten。， So for you， it's a lot of， that less serious， less， pressure。

 more loose， more， goofy， funnuous， perioper， s now to be out there。， Stop trying to be so， cool。

 stop trying to make， everyone like you。， You know， generate that， fun。。

 It's like be more polarizing。， I want more people to， hate you， more people to， love you。。

 I don't want to see people， like you。， Okay？， I'll give you some， comments throughout the， night。

 We'll kind of play， around that。 But that， would be like the general， direction to move towards。。

 If you do that， it， will be very， very， golden。， Even at the end of the， night， say there's like。

 all the heart-girls are， gone。， Pull and ugly go。， And as he said， you， don't necessarily have to。

 fuck her， but get that， reference。， Because you will see， tens， same fucking， logistics。

 And if you just， wait for the tens to do it，， you're fucked。， And then， yeah， I mean，， it's like。

 as you said，， you can either fuck her， or not。 It's up to you，， but again， it doesn't。

 lower your value either。， Because that's you。， No， it's like you're， an awesome person。 You。

 don't need that extra， validation。 You're not， chasing the high。， With the public， image。

 people have this， impression where I'm， like out。 And I'm like，， like that。 In reality，， no。

 it's like， it's my， party。 And again， as I， said， I'm going to talk to， all our girls。 I'm going to。

 move around。 And I just， kind of keep it going。 And as， I move， it's like arms， length， and it's。

 more like a bring-in， process。， As I move， I do the， bring-in versus these， more。， Yeah。， Now。

 occasionally on， bootcamp， I will send you， across through， because I， am dealing for you guys。

 dealing with that pressure。， But ideally， it's like，， yeah， so you're not， like that。。

 It's not like this scanning。， It's like， hey， come here，， come here， come here，， come here。

 come here。 And it's， like， it's super high， that it looks like you， know all these people， too。。

 Like anyone from the， outside is like， oh my， god， you don't stand out as， a stewed rushing up to。

 sets and shit。 It's a， really good。 There's no， point to it other than just， self-expression。

 It's like，， ideally， you reach that， point where a night out， I， compare it's like， detention。

 Like you're， stuck there。 And it's， like， you're like， what do， you want to do？， It's like， you're。

 stuck till the end of the， night。 You assume you're， going to fuck girl at the， end of the night。

 You have， three hours， four hours to， burn。 What do you want to， do to make these three。

 four hours awesome？， That could be getting a， number。 It could be， fucking up a set for fun。。

 It could be dancing a bit。， It could be fucking， out of your wings。 It could。

 be doing some weird shit。， It's like， getting， creative in a self-missive， way。 Like， fuck， what。

 being this cool？ It would be， like， ridiculous。 You， know， versus like， trying to。

 live up to all these， things。 Like， what would be， awesome？ You know， while， still taking action on。

 the show。， Obviously。 So， it's more of， that thing there。 I'm like，， oh， that'd be super。

 weird and funny to do。 Let's， fuck around here。 It's like，， make it like an epic， movie。

 the whole night's an， epic movie。 We'll make the， movie more epic。 The rule， is not。

 I must keep them， short。 It's usually they'll， naturally die down， bounce out。。

 Or if you're not having fun，， bounce out。 But if you're， having fun and it's going， well。

 keep riding that way。， Yeah。 Yeah。 If I talk to a， girl in the beginning， it's。

 going really well and it's， keeping the fun going。 I'll， talk to her even 20， minutes。 It's like。

 the， beginning is all about you。， So， when 1AM hits， you， find yourself in a situation。

 where you feel awesome。 You， have massive， fun， passion，， care-free-ness。 You have a。

 bunch of leads， a bunch of， numbers， a bunch of logistics。， Bang！ That's your only， goal that I 1AM。

 you're in that situation。， And that's up to you。 And， that's also that nothing to， win。

 nothing to lose。， At 1AM， we're not going to， usually have pulled yet。 Well，。

 it'll be still us here。 But， there's different courses， of action you can take， before then to find。

 yourself in a more beneficial， situation at that point。， This will happen sometimes。

 before you go out， but， even while you go out。 Like，， you start off really well，。

 and then it kind of gets， to you。 And you're like，， oh， I must keep doing well， or do better。

 And if I do， worse， then I feel like， shit。 Then I'm failing。 And， then again， like you have。

 high expectations， then you're， attached to a certain， outcome。 It's the reason I。

 tell you on day one of， bootcamp。 Okay， remember，， it's not a Hollywood， movie。 Is remember that？。

 Because that's what happens。， Like， you do well， one night。 Okay， it's like， first time bootcamp。

 It's， natural to think well。 It's a， three-day program。 And， every day I get a little bit， better。

 And then you go， out and you're like， okay，， well， tonight better，， do well。 Holy fuck。 And then。

 it's like there's that， outcome and that pressure。 And， when you expect it， it goes， to shit。

 And you probably， experienced that even in the， past where， I mean， I had。

 this so many times in the past。， Like， say there's like one， night you're just really。

 looking forward to it。 You know，， it's like it's the big night。， It might be like some special。

 events。 You're like weeks， and head looking for it。 And， then it happens。 You just， docks it。

 Because you expect， it so much。 Okay， why？ And， it's kind of what we talked about。， Yes。

 you're trying to make， something happen instead of， creating a situation with。

 that allows it to happen。 And， how do you create a situation， allowing it to happen？ You， welcome。

 like， whatever， happens， science is going to， happen。 Welcome all， experiences。 Well， that's。

 more so on the general， mindset。 Then we'll get to， on the more technical side。 Yeah，。

 this is like the general， understanding。 But when you're， having that state crash， you。

 can tell yourself like， oh，， I expected it's still， it's， still going to fuck you。 Yeah。。

 But this is something that I， try to remind myself every， night before I go out。 And。

 you should do the same。 It's， like tonight。 Just notice，， like， okay， is there any。

 expectation pressure？ Is， there is there certain， things that I'm like， I'm。

 expecting on myself tonight？， And if there are， New， come。 Now that doesn't， mean don't push。

 yourself。 You know you're， going to push yourself。 That's， assumed。 But that's the， basic criteria。

 I'm going to， push myself and whatever， happens happens。 Either it'll， be glorious。 Either I'll。

 encounter a lot of， resistance and a lot of， rejection。 It'll be shitty。， But no matter what I'm。

 going to learn， and no matter， what， it'll be interesting。， Because that too， that's what。

 makes it interesting。 It's the， fact that there are ups and， downs。 The fact that it is， messy。

 The fact that there are， shitty times， the shitty， nights。 That's what that's， some contrast to it。

 So， tonight， you could have an， amazing night。 You could， also have the worst night of。

 the boot camp tonight。 Who， knows？ And as long as there's， your resistance to it， usually。

 that'll create a situation， that allows it to go well。 And， that's what I'm going to do。。

 I'm going to create a situation， that allows it to go well。 But， then you can also be like， OK，。

 it's your resistance because I， wanted to go well。 Now you're， also attached to the outcome。 So。

 really it is， whatever happens， happens。 OK？ You know， you're going to push， yourself。 That's it。。

 baseline。 Push， yourself。 But don't be， like， I need to do this。 I need， to get two make-outs。

 tonight。 And I need to do this。， Then it's way too much， pressure。 All you know is。

 you're going to push， yourself and whatever happens， you're going to learn。 Bang！。

 That's the mindset going into， every single night， every single， time you go out。 So at some。

 point tonight you're going to feel， your emotions go down。 That， happens to me as well。 Happens。

 to all of us。 That's the way， emotions work。 Now the key is， I expect it to happen。 I expect。

 myself to have a certain say， crash tonight。 Or certain， port where it kind of goes to， shit。

 If you don't expect it，， that's when you start freaking， out。 And that's what makes， it worse。

 And you probably， realize it。 Say it starts， going a little less well and。

 suddenly your mind is probably， like， oh fuck。 Maybe the rest， of night is going to be shit。 Oh。

 fuck。 Oh fuck。 And you start， kind of panicking。 And that just， makes it fucking worse。 So don't。

 panic。 Expect it and accept it。， Expect and accept。 Okay。 So， again at some point tonight and。

 you'll remember this moment， here， you're going to feel it， kind of going down。 You'll be， like。

 oh yeah。 Okay。 Here's， the moment。 Cool。 I accept it。， Okay。 And from there， you have。

 to take smart action。 Okay。 The， old school analogy for this， was a plane when it hit， turbulence。

 You know you're， going to hit turbulence at， some point。 And what happens， is the newbie pilot hits。

 turbulence。 He freaks out。 He's， like， turbulence。 Wow。， Boom。 Panic。 The advanced。

 pilot hits turbulence。 He's， like， oh， turbulence。 He expects， it。 He accepts it。 And then。

 what he's do， he just takes the， appropriate action。 Click，， click， click。， Well， keeping his calm。

 So， that's you。 You embrace the， night when it happens。 Keep， your calm。 And then let's。

 focus on the right click，， click， click。 Okay。 So first， one is don't get sucked into， the feeling。

 Don't get sucked， into it。 Because this is big。， Once you start that starts， taking over。

 you become the， emotion。 And this is pretty， key。 We're creatures of habit， on a macro on a macro。

 level， but also on a micro， level。 And you're going to， fuel that emotion。 So in your， reality。

 when that hits，， everything in your mind is， going to reinforce it。 Like， the， oh， fuck。

 it's hitting me。， Oh， my God。 That's， reinforcing it。 There's a， saying memory， estate， access，。

 dependent。 What does that mean？， When you're in a certain， state of mind， you remember all。

 the other times you were in that， same state of mind。 So when you， have an estate crash， you're。

 remembering all the other times。， You're like， oh， fuck， I'm， sucking。 And then you remember。

 the other times you suck。 I'm， like， oh， I really suck， even more。 Oh， fuck。 And it's， like。

 it takes you on this， downward， fuck， and spiral。， It even reaches a point where。

 you could not even imagine， getting in the zone again or， what the zone feels like。 It's。

 like when you're really sick，， you're like， oh， you can't， even remember what it feels。

 like to not be sick。 And you， get so hooked on it that at， some point it's like you don't。

 even think it's possible to， snap out of it。 And deep， down inside emotionally， you。

 don't even want to snap out of， it。 It's like if you're really， mad and then it turns out。

 there's nothing to be mad， about。 You don't just switch。， You're like， oh， but still。。

 It's like you're still， hanging onto it。 So the， first one is like， realize， the mechanism at play。

 And， the key is take perspective。， Don't be the emotion。 Take， a step back and observe it。

 in the third person in a way。， Okay， it's like， I， compared this in Pimp to a， TV show。

 Do you guys know， friends， the TV show？， Okay， there's a scene in the。

 bathroom where Ross has these， leather pants and there's like， dud， love the powder。 Do you。

 guys see that scene？ He's， like trying to put his pants， on and he can't and， he's like。

 it's he's in the， girls' bathroom at a place， and he can't get it because。

 he can't get his pants back， up。 Now for him in the， TV show， that stressful is， fuck。

 He's freaking the， fuck out。 For you watching， it， are you freaking the， fuck out to？

 Are you on your， couch？ Like， oh my God， my， pants。 No， you're just like。

 you're observing a kind of， with perspective。 And that's， the key here。 You can choose。

 to be the emotion of freaking， out of the golf。 Stay crash， or you can observe yourself， in a way。

 having a stay crash。， And from that place there，， suddenly you're no longer， identified with it and。

 suddenly you can be rational， in terms of the decisions， you make。 Then you give your， character。

 it's like you give， Ross the proper instructions， for him to snap out versus。

 being caught up in being， Ross。 It's kind of like I rise， above the emotion。 It's like。

 I see the emotion。 I'm like，， oh， that's the emotion。 What can， I do to fix this？ Kind of。

 versus being like， ah， it's， like， oh， there's this certain， emotion。 Can you train it？ It's a。

 skill you can train it so。 Yeah，， you mean it'll happen in， situations in life just in， general。

 There's times where， we're really upset， times where， it's stressed out， be it in， game or not。

 And then you can， kind of see like， are you the， emotion or can you take some。

 perspective and observe the， emotion and the you feeling the， emotion？ So when you're in the， field。

 so you're kind of， getting this。 Yeah。 So it's like，， yeah， for that's what it's like，。

 take like 30 seconds。 I take， it。 I would say 30。 Okay，， this is the action time。 So 30。

 seconds to a minute to take that， perspective and kind of， re-center yourself。 Yeah。 So you。

 are in the field。 Oh， yeah。， If I'm like， ah， and I feel， it's like going shit， I'm like，， okay。

 there's something wrong， here。 I see the turbulence。 Let's， take a little 30 second to。

 minute break。 During the 30， second minutes break， I slow it， all down。 If I'm like，， tense。

 I'll loosen up， and then， I'll just look。 Okay， is there， pressure， is there stress？ And。

 that's when I start taking， perspective。 I don't identify， with it。 I'm like， okay， I'm。

 having to stay crash。 Okay，， this is happening。 Now， what can， I do to fix this？ Big one。 And。

 we talked about this a lot， especially， with you。 Embrace。 Embrace。， Yeah。

 Because that's resistance， is another way that keeps you， down。 It's like you want to be。

 and say you're not out of state。 Don't， your f**k。 As long as there's， that friction， you're f**ked。

 So， embrace whatever you're feeling。， Embrace the pressure。 Embrace， the state crash from there。。

 Exaggerate it。 And then start， laughing at it。 And from there，， keep taking action while doing。

 this， trusting that at some， point it'll sneak up on you again。， Okay， and I'll give you a story。

 of a guy in London on， bootcamp。 Okay， so this was like， one of the more extreme， state crashes。

 So this was a， year ago or so。 The guy was on， bootcamp and it was during the。

 third night of bootcamp。 Half way， through the night， he comes up to， me。 He's like， hey， Joe。

 I need to， talk to you。 Okay， and he seemed， really upset and just really， sad。 And I was like。

 it's kind of， weird。 Like， he was having an awesome， week。 The previous night， all three。

 of the guys pulled。 So I was like，， f**k， yeah， and he comes up to me， like， what？

 And he takes me to， the side and he's in breaks down in， tears。 Okay， like full out， middle。

 of the club breaking down in tears，， something。 What the f**k's wrong？， And he's like。

 I lied to you。 I didn't， pull last night。 So two of the guys， pulled and he said he pulled because。

 he wanted to be cool， like the two， other guys。 And he breaks down in a， second， sorry， f**k。

 I'm so， pathetic。 I'm like， full stay， crash in the middle of the club。， Now。

 this is a little different，， and you'll experience different， stay crashes， be it stress， whatever。。

 But this is like a full one where， guess what？ Does he feel happy？， Does he feel like broaching？

 F**k， no。 Okay， so I tell him， it's， 30 seconds to minute。 It's fine。， Recenter yourself。 Take that。

 perspective。 He does that。 From， there， I tell him embrace， exaggerate life。 So embrace what。

 you feel and try to exaggerate， a bit to the point where you start， kind of laughing at it and。

 mocking it。 Because when you have， that， that kind of dissipates。， And then keep taking action。， So。

 because again， action， that's， the only way you can really affect， it。 If it's smart action。 So I。

 send him up to the first girl and， his opener is， hey， I'm extremely， sad I lied to my friend。

 That's his， opener。 Okay。 And from there， he， kind of has to exaggerate it and， laugh。

 So he goes in， he's like， hey，， you know， I'm extremely sad I lied， to my friend。 And he's feeling。

 really sad。 So he can't really， exaggerate it and he doesn't laugh， at all。

 And they talk to him like a， minute or so and he comes back， really sad。 And what you'll。

 realize too is the girls will not， really fully reject you if you're， again clear energy。

 We saw that， clear energy。 Even sad clear energy。， They're not going to fucking。

 for it unless it's like out of， pity， but they won't give them that， harsh rejection。

 Most of the time。， So he comes back and I go， okay，， keep it going。 Okay。 It could，。

 you could get it back in two minutes，， you could get it back in two hours。。

 But this is the only steps in， process you can take。 Send them to， the next girl he goes in。， Okay。

 I'm extremely sad。， I lied to my friend。， But without he has like a little， hint of a smile。

 but doesn't， laugh。 He comes back。， Next girl goes in。 Has a little， bit more of hint of a smile。。

 Next girl smiles a bit。 Next girl。， Chuckles a bit。 Next girl has a， little bit of a laugh。

 Next girl， rejected。 Now what happened， there？ Then this is interesting。。

 He started feeling a little bit， better because he had that little， laugh。 And then him opening。

 sane。 Hey， I'm extremely sad。， Was no longer congruent。 So he got， rejected because of that。 So I。

 sent him to the next one。 I'm like， embrace what you feel now。 And his， new open is， hey。

 I used to be， sad。 I'm a little bit less sad， now。 So on and so forth。 And by。

 keeping that process going， it， came back to him。 But that's， really the key。 It's like， take。

 respect if 30 seconds to a， minute。 Don't identify with it。， Don't keep reinforcing it。 Don't。

 get sucked into it。 View it。， Again， from that more neutral， state of mind。 From there，， embrace。

 exaggerate， laugh， and， just keep taking action， trusting， and another key way of view in it。

 is having blind faith that at， some point， you'll get it back。， Because you're not going to see， it。

 You're not going to see the， light at the end of the tunnel of， you being in the zone when you're。

 in that state。 So it's literally， like believing in a way in like a， higher power。 It's like。

 have blind， faith that if you take this action， and you follow this process， it'll， sneak up on you。

 Take two minutes，， take two hours， but it will come。， And imagine it's the beginning of。

 the night again。 Because that's， another thing that will drag you， down。

 And I'm sure you experienced， that last night when it happened。， Is scarcity kicked in。。

 Because now you're having your， state crash， but it's in the second， part of the night。 So suddenly。

 you're like， oh， there's less time。， Oh， fuck， I have to do something， now。

 And then like the scarcity。， So imagine it's the beginning of the， night again。 I just arrived。

 abundance， of women， abundance of time。 That'll， help you。 But that's like a process。

 that I undergo。 And the more you do it，， you'll kind of identify it when it。

 starts going down and you'll just， quickly snap out of it。 Versus。

 is reaching that lower point we have， to snap out of it。 That's what I do。。

 When I see it kind of happening， I'm， like， oh， I'll do something funny。， So girl， like， oh， yeah。

 you know，， I'm kind of in my head right now。， I'll address it fast。 And instead of。

 going like this throughout the night，， you kind of go like this。 Now with， make-outs， I mean。

 you saw me make-outs， with some girls。 Sometimes I do，， sometimes I don't。 But it really。

 just depends on how I feel。 Or on， how the girl feels in a way。 It's not， a necessity。 Okay。

 Can you pull， a girl without kissing her in the， club and fuck her？ Yeah。 Yeah。。

 Can you pull a girl while kissing her？， Yeah。 It doesn't matter。， It's like a high five literally。。

 If you kiss the girl， what does it do？， It reinforces some physical， chemistry， let's just say， or。

 connection。 If you don't kiss the， girl， what does it do？ Suddenly， she's like。

 why is it not kissing me？， You get her chasing her。， The difference in the day two。。

 The two are just， yeah，， we're coffee， we're just friends。， But when you kiss， then suddenly， oh，。

 you could be my boyfriend。， Kiss her in the bedroom。， And you can kiss her if you want。。

 But my main message here is，， if you want to kiss her， go for the kiss。， But that's not your goal。。

 Your goal is to isolate。， Very important。 Your goal is not， too escalate。 Your goal is to isolate。。

 If you want to escalate while， you're aiming to isolate， that's fine。， It doesn't hurt。。

 But it's not your main objective。， Then once you isolate， then you， fucking escalate。。

 I'd rather kiss her in a bed where， she can then escalate to fucking me。， But I'll do both。， Again。

 if I like the girl and， it's in the club and it makes sense，， I'll for sure kiss her。。

 But I'm not like， oh， this is one， step closer to pulling because I'm， kissing her。， You know。

 as we saw， as you saw in the， video on physicality， a kiss is more， of an expression of your intent。

， It's not to accomplish anything。， It's not a stepping stone towards， sex。

 The stepping stone towards sex is， the baby's step to the logistics and。

 the pulling strategic mindset。， So that's not your main concern and。

 don't feel like the interactions， sparked if you didn't kiss her。。

 You're placing the bar too high for， what mental women means。， Mental women， if I'm like， hey，。

 how's it going？ That's mental women。， It's not this high-end bar where， she's getting on her knees。

 suck in your， dick。， It's long as she's acknowledging， your existence and she cares like。

 it's mental women。， That's the good enough。， And that's very important too because。

 that's what takes a lot of pressure off。， Good enough。， Okay？ It doesn't have to be like。

 super sexual and also realize that， it depends on the girl。， Some girls， the way they express。

 their interest in you is more visible， than other girls。 Some girls are more shy。。

 If you tell a joke to 100，000 girls，， are they all going to laugh like crazy？。

 Some are going to laugh， some are going to， smile， some are going to be like，， hmm。

 doesn't mean they didn't find it funny。， It's just the way they express it。。

 So your criteria is like， what's good， enough？ Her acknowledging your， existence and caring。。

 That's good enough because she doesn't， have to。， As long as she's there， for me， I view。

 that as if she's sucking my dick。， That's the same amount of interest。， And that'll help too。

 especially in terms， of you， again， it's like， she's not， reactive。 You're expecting too much。。

 You need to reassign a new interpretation， of her just being like， listen to you。。

 That's 10 out of 10。 Keep her there。， Focus on the logistics。。

 The goal is not to make her so attracted， that she fucks you。 The goal is to。

 get her in a situation where she can fuck you。， Because that's what most guys， are ready。

 They try to get her so attracted， that they think that at some point， she's going to be like。

 let's go。， Okay。， You take her。， Have to clap this thing， closing。， Like， a straight-lock partner。。

 Try pulling。， Try pulling。， Hey， let's go to the after party。， See what happens。。

 What if she has friends？， And she says， yeah， my friends are coming， after after party。。

 You can try bringing all your friends there， and figure it out。， You can try changing your mind。。

 You're like， oh， you know what？， It's my friend。 Let me just text him。， Oh， he's not answering。。

 Yeah， no。， I may go see another friend where you guys are going。， I want to pull a girl and say。

 yeah，， let's go to my after party。， And then she said， yeah， but I have。

 my other friends can I go with the after party？， Well， that's why I just told you。， You're like， oh。

 let me text my friend。， It's at his place， actually。， Okay。， I'm still on the side。。

 And then you tell her， no。， Oh， he's not answering。， We're not going。， Then you go for plan B。。

 Okay。， I mean， you can invite all their friends to your place， if you want。。

 And then try to isolate her in the bathroom。， You can。， But it's not ideal。。

 So just change your mind and get out of it。， She's like， oh， my friends， you're like， yeah， yeah。。

 It's actually at my friends place。， Let me text him。， Oh， he's not answering。， Let's go there later。

 maybe。， Okay。， And then try to find another strategic game plan。。

 This is the narrowest culture where I can only pull one gun， out of the club。， You can try。。

 But if you can't， what do you do？， You go with her。， Yeah。， Yeah。， That's how you get out of it。。

 And then you just wait and you go with her。， And remember to a lot of going with her is endurance。。

 Staying in for a long period of time， is kind of playing the long run。。

 It's pretty much kind of hand in hand what I told him。， When you're committing。

 I don't care if you're needy。， You're staying in there。， You know， try to smile。。

 You can maybe chat a girl here and there。， But you're keeping your eye on the fucking girl。。

 You do not let her out of your sight。， You'd walk and wait in front of the bathroom for her to come out。

， That's what you should do when you're pulled。， You commit。， That's how serious it is。， Okay。。

 Especially to his girls operating temporary truths。， She could mean it in the moment she comes back。

 but then something could happen if she won't。， That'll happen all the time。， So here with the girl。

 she's like，， hey， I'll be right back。， I promise。， I like you。， Goes the bathroom， runs into me。。

 She's not coming back。， So don't let her out of your sight。， Protect it at all costs。。

 Stay on it at all costs。， And if you are in a little needy at times，。

 that's fine because she's looking at the bigger picture of it all。。

 So over the whole time we spent together，， is this guy more sex-worthy than not，。

 if the answer is yes good。， There's always times of chodiness。， It's totally fine。。

 The girl will fuck you for the big picture，， not the small event。， So keep that in mind。。

 Don't let it get to you。， You can chill on your phone next to the girl。， You know。

 fuck around on the phone。， Keep your head kind of bop in。， Keep the fun generating the doing。。

 You can even open and just casually chat someone， but fucking keep your eye out of time。。

 And then the other one with you was， cutting through the friends。。

 And with that it really comes down to like being the fucking leader。， You can't be the follower。。

 And also being smart in the strategy。， So with her， remember her vine temperature was high。。

 Now this year， okay，， and this is another interesting one。。

 The general rule of in the first part of the night，， nothing will happen。， That's 99% true。。

 If you see a girl who's down in the first part of the night，， who has high vine temperature，。

 pull her。， Don't wait till the second part of the night。， Pull while the iron is hot。。

 How would you know that she has。。。， You'll sense it。， It's feeling。。。， I don't know if she's like。。。

， Like super excited。， Like， like sexual physical。， Like， okay。， Ready to go。， You know。。

 So you start like pulling it around。， Yep。， So you would probably know when you start doing those actions。

， If she's really。。。， Yeah。， You can always just test。， That's not what I mean， too。。

 You don't really know test。， Like， hey， you know， I think my friend is having an after-party。。

 We're like， hey， come over here with me。， And she's like， no， no， no。， Then she's like， oh。

 that's not yet。， Okay， never mind。， Anyway， blah， blah， blah， blah。， I'll try again later。， Yeah。

 so I was like， just test。， And with references，， you'll kind of get a feeling for it。。

 But with her when it's like high vine temperature，。

 commit and then start kind of engaging in the pulling process。。

 So it could take 30 minutes or 40 minutes。， But you've got a girl who's ready。。

 And her goal is no longer to have a bunch of action。， Or her goal is like。

 I want the climax pretty soon。， Now with her， when you're thinking， okay。

 to get her out of the club，， how does it help you to merge her into all those other girls？。

 It doesn't。， There's zero purpose to it。， It just pulls the interaction back。， So don't do that。。

 Don't make things more complicated than they need to be。， Okay， you do that。。

 You're pretty much especially the way you merge like， yeah。， And then you stand on the sideline。

 never do that。， And this is something you should have noticed with me。， When I merge。

 I'm in control of the interaction at all times。， I don't let the girls take over。， Okay。， Yeah。

 I'm leading all the time。， I'll let them chat at times。， I'm not like， oh， never talk。。

 But notice I'm not like， oh， here。， I never do that。， Yeah。

 because I think I did yesterday and I took 11。， Oh， yeah。， Oh， no， you keep it going。。

 It's not a break。， It doesn't give you a timeout card。， It's like， you know what I mean？， It's like。

 yeah， it's my friend's my friend。， Hey， say hi to her。， So this is this girl。， Okay。

 what's your name？， Oh， cool。， Hey， pal， I'm so fucking part of it。。

 I'm still the fucking leader there。， I'm still the main guy。， Okay， you're not like， here。。

 Then you're done。， And then of course， good luck jumping back in。， Okay。， So it's like。

 don't let yourself get in that position in the first place。， And how do you get out of it？。

 Interrupt。， Be loud。， Interrupt with a huge smile。， Like， hey， so anyway， so anyway。， English。

 English， English。， Hey， cool。， Let's do it with a huge smile。， Lead and don't chase。。

 That should be your mantra。， Leading and not chasing。， For example， if a girl's looking away，。

 you can say， hey， look at me。， And it could be chasing or needy if you say it in a chasing way。。

 You can be like， look at me。， That's bad。， What if you say it in a leading way？。

 Look at me with a bit of a smile。， Positively， like positive leading versus chasing。。

 Think like that。， Positively， not chasing。， So whatever it is， like， hey， anyway。， Interrupts。

。
