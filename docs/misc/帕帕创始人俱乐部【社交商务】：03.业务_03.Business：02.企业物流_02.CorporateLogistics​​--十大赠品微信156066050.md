 learning and constantly refining the jobs and the tasks。

 We also use a lot of technology to grow what we're doing。

 There's all sorts of technological resources to grow for say business。

 Yet a lot of people haven't developed that for social purposes until this last decade。

 So if you look at things like salesforce。com， or customer relationship management program。

 where you manage customers and you can see what our purchase history， That's cool。

 A lot of people are trying to do that now for social purposes， In fact， back in the day。

 I used to do just that， I used to use a lot of the software I used for business。

 to track my social interactions， Like what I did， My history is kind of a journal。

 just with particular individuals， particular friends， or from a daily life， particular girls。

 and also kind of track who they know， In fact， I guess that's why LinkedIn became popular。

 because this was a product that people really needed， I mean， we created real social dynamics。

 This is a product that I believe I personally needed， I personally wanted。

 because I was always throwing elaborate， extravagant parties。

 But I didn't really know how to do cold approach pick up。

 and that's why we kind of built RSD to be the way it is， At the same time。

 when you're building a team， you're building a company， you also need a teach them to grow。

 So in the same path， because I like to compare a lot of what we do for business。

 for your social life， you got to do the same thing for your social circle， for your friends。

 for your family， So a lot of things I like to do is try to help them out。

 If I'm expanding my social repertoire， going to parties and what have you， I'll take those people。

 even the most socially awkward people， and throw them into really interesting parties。

 and soul situations， I'll do accomplishment and introductions， where I say， hey， this is my buddy。

 He's a really awesome， great guy， and then just get him involved in conversation。

 with beautiful girls and other guys， and it's not necessarily just for pickup。

 It's just to get their social repertoire up， This is my friends' accede。

 as my friends gain more skills， more social capital， It's kind of doing the same thing for me。

 as I always say， when you look at guys who have a massive role of decks。

 it's only because the people that are in their friendship circle。

 also have some kind of role of decks， and every single person that you meet。

 will exponentially grow what that is， and what that looks like。

 Now another thing is really important though， is to manage your schedule and manage your time。

 In terms of logistics， we are always short on time， and it's crazy how fast the time goes by。

 I don't even know what day it is， because all of our games seem to be very similar。

 especially when you're in my position， as an entrepreneur and you're building a business。

 So as a result， oftentimes， I don't even know what week date is。

 how sometimes I don't even know how old I am， I have to actually calculate that number。

 because the days go by so fast， and as you get older it's even more rapid speed。

 So what is really important is for you guys to schedule stuff。

 There's software that is like a sauna， or is base camp， you get a tracker task for business。

 but more and more， people are using the same software， the tracker task for their personal life。

 having schedules and assistants are important as well， I used to not have an assistant。

 I had an assistant for the first time， just a couple of years ago。

 and now I have a personal assistant， and a business assistant。

 I have a personal assistant doing all those tasks， where I feel like I'm leveraging my time。

 maybe thinking from getting groceries， doing errands， going shopping for me。

 and that allows me to focus on those higher level things， like networking， building the business。

 making contacts， and it's also very important， because although and payroll right now。

 we fluctuate anywhere from like a hundred， to 200 people on payroll， yet at the same time。

 we have anywhere from 600 to over a thousand people， volunteering for us。

 and we have to manage teams of people， to manage these people。

 to help out a week and here and there， and also to grow， because as we are growing the company。

 it's so much more important for us， to get reliable， dependable people。

 to help us grow this company， in the same way， when you first grow your solar circle。

 you're gonna have to have a massive amount of experience， with wide variety of people。

 people that may or may not be as reliable or as dedicated， but that's important。

 it's important for you to get that wide variety， so you know where you want to invest your time。

 those people who really dedicated to self-improvement。

 growth and invested in your future and success， those are the people you want to invest in。

 those people who I've invested， and the most important and most valuable thing you have。

 are your personal friends， your long-term business friends， who are hopefully your personal friends。

 and your family， and I consider all these people， are part of my family as well。
