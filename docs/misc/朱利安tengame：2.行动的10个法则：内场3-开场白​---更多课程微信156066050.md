# 朱利安ten game：2.行动的10个法则：内场 3- 开场白​---更多课程微信156066050

我們要抱起來，要求做足夠和千方肉體，The best vibe when you open is hey check this out，That should be the new open。

Open equals hey check this out，Hey did you hey check this out this girl？。

That should be your dialogue wall out，Check this out，When I'm open I'm like hey check this out。

Here's this little inside joke I have with myself，If you're talking to your wing。

You guys should have some sort of inside joke with your wing，Oh hey check this out。

We're talking about this，And that draws her in，You always want to think draw her in。

Don't pull her in，Because that's taking，You're trying to take，You're trying to pull her in。

What can you do instead to inspire to be drawn in，The hey check this out，We'll get her drawn in。

If you're actually having like a blast，And say hey check this out，What check what out。

Now she gets drawn in，Okay that's the open，And the hey check this out，Once again。

 Lower your criteria，It doesn't have to be like this，Awesome inside joke，It's just 0。001%。

Good emotions，If you can just offer her that，That's a good check this out。

And even hey check this out，Some realness，You know and the realness is big。

Guys underestimate the value of authenticity，Okay，Authenticity，Even when for example。

You may feel anxious，You may be out of state，If you're out of state，What's valuable telling the girl。

You're out of state，And claim out of state game，Because it's real，You immediately fuck yourself。

When you're out of state，And you try to be in state，Because now you're fake，Now you're manipulative。

Now there's no authenticity，Okay，The fact that you're in state，Or out of state。

Really doesn't matter that much，And once you're actually，Being real，Being out of state。

You will automatically feel，Better，Cause you're no longer，Hiding that，And there's no longer。

That friction that comes from resistance，Busween what is，And what you want reality to be。

Because that's out of state，It's like，You're out of state，It'll sneak up on you，You know。

It could be attachment to the outcome，It could be scarcity，Something will happen。

And you're gonna start，You know，Falling down，Let's just say，And what happens is。

Your emotions kind of go down，And it's to be expected，Your emotions go up and down，Whatever，But then。

You place the label，Being out of state's bad，Your emotions going down，You're like，Fuck。

I'm being out of state，Shit，Panic kicks in，Stress kicks in，You judging yourself kicks in，Angry。

You're like stupid idiot，You're out of state，All that extra shit，Drags you down。

And then there's that friction，Where，You want to be in state，But you're not，And there's that。

It doesn't like what you want，And reality don't match，And it's hell，You know。

You're not gonna feel good，The easiest fix，To start feeling better，Is to embrace it，But okay。

I'm out of state，Okay，What you're looking for，Is a match，That'll help a lot。

Cause you're out of state，This is let's just say，In state，You want to be up here。

There are two ways you can start feeling good，Either you magically get up here，Or。

You're just lower the f***ing bar，You're just looking for the match，And now you're here。

You're feeling good，And then you'll be propelled up，And the girl respect you for it，You're like，Okay。

I'm out of state，Now of course，Keep talking after that，And build on that。

Cause that's the thing guys will do，It's like，Tell her you're out of state，I'm out of state。

And then they're like，Trying to take a reaction，Tick，give me，Keep expressing that。

Like you can talk about me now to state，Ideally you express the fact you're out of state。

You embrace it，And then you start feeling a little bit better。

And then what can you do to feel even better，You can kind of exaggerate the fact you're out of state。

And try to make yourself laugh a bit，You know，And now you're feeling good。

You're also hitting the fun and carefree，But hey you know I'm out of state，It happens。

You know I didn't pay attention to what Julian was saying，And now I'm out of state。

You can tell her that，Now suddenly it's like you embraced it，You feel better now you're laughing。

Cause you're kind of exaggerating it，And you're taking perspective。

You're no longer identified without a state，Okay，And this is actually pretty big too。

A lot of game is getting creative，The guys were the best at the game，The guys were the most creative。

Not necessarily creative in terms of like，Coming up with plotlines or anything that you're saying。

But creative in terms of using，Situations to，Game themselves to feel good。

To hit that fun carefree passion，Anything that happens， Whether it's something you say。

She says a situation，It can always be linked to one of the three，If you're creative enough。

No matter what it is，You're out of state，How can you use bean out of state，Fun carefree passion。

What we talked about embrace exaggerate laugh，If you get rejected，How can you use that。

To fuel fun carefree passion，You can do something like to make，Make the rejection fun。

Like my favorite go to，No no no but I make a lot of money，Share like that，The girls like what。

Now use the rejection，To fuel fun and carefree，Fun because you're laughing。

Carefree because you're laughing at yourself，So there's always an angle，You just gotta find it。

You gotta be start thinking creative here，Next time say you're out of state。

Think okay how can I get creative，How can I get creative。

How can I use this to fuel fun carefree passion，And you know there's a way。

I can guarantee you there's a way，You just gotta find it，And once you master this。

You'll never have a bad night again，Once you master this，You'll never have a bad night again。

Because no matter what happens，You're always linking it to fun carefree passion。

The same with like congruence tests，What is that，It's like the girls gonna throw some shit at you。

Just see how you react，Okay，And this will naturally happen，And when it happens it's good，By the way。

Because she wants to make sure，You're all that，You're all this，The first four laws。

Guys can go up and fake this for 10 seconds，Maybe 30 seconds。

But usually they can't take it for a long period of time。

This is why most polls last 45 minutes or now and a half，She wants to make sure，You're this guy。

Is he really this guy？，Is he putting on a front，What if I throw this at him。

She's trying to see if there's any weird bullshit that pops out，It's like if you're。

You know the best way to go about in my opinion，Going about say interviewing someone。

It's like work for them，Is you want to do multiple interviews for a longer period of time to see if some bullshit will pop out。

Because anyone can show up to the first interview，Say it's like 10 minutes，Like，Hello。

I am perfect in every way，But say you spend more time like two hour interview。

Or you do it like 10 minutes here，10 minutes there，You're seen as any weird shit is gonna pop out。

Is he really that person，Same with a girl，What if I throw this at that person，What if I do this。

What if I present this situation，How will that person react，Is there any weird shit that pops out。

That's the girl，Ok，So what happens is she'll do that，And most guys will be panic，Ok。

On one hand after a while it won't really affect you，Because you will be that person。

But until then here's another little trick in terms of getting creative。

Learn to use whatever she throws at you to link to fun carefree passion，In brace it，Don't resist it。

Now if the girl's like you're you know your shirt sucks，It makes me more attainable。

Thank you it makes me more attainable，Now you just took it you made it your own and you linked it to fun。

And carefree because you didn't take it personally，You know I hate your shirt。

Yeah you know my mom got it for me，Yeah you know I try I try I usually look too good I need to do this。

Should like that，Ok，So keep that in mind，But with opening，Linking back to open，Check this out。

Whatever it is，Check this out，I will crack into some situations here，Ok，So this first one，I love it。

You'll I'm basically here with Owen，This girl walks right next to me，And every single guy does this。

The girl walks there you see her and you hesitate，Is everybody that？。

And now you're trying to think of the perfect angle to jump in。

You're like ah man ok what's the good angle here，Not only that。

But then how do you get in your own way，Ok but now she already saw me，So she saw me。

She knows I didn't open，Will it look stupid if I open now，Oh fuck now I'm thinking this。

And she's probably seeing me thinking right now，I should have jumped in before，Downhill，Ok。

You just keep going down，And this is very important to understand。

You can't ever think your way out of approach anxiety， Ever，Thinking will only fuel approach anxiety。

Why？，Cause thoughts are self reinforcing，You have approach anxiety，You're gonna keep fueling that。

You're trying to think your way out of it，I'm gonna try to find a logical reason to jump in。

I'm gonna win this debate here，You're not gonna win it，You're just gonna keep fueling it。

Not only that，But you probably realize memory state access dependent。

You're gonna remember all the other times you're in that situation，It's hell。

There's no getting out of it，So two key things here，1。 Don't buy into that。

You realize like it's a fucking illusion，And you're projecting that shit on the girl。

You're overblowing it，And reality is never as bad as you picture it。

Like once you're in that head trip，You're like fuck if I open her，She's gonna freaking freak out。

Everyone's gonna mock me，Her boyfriend's gonna come， Smash a bottle and stab me。

Like you're really picture in the worst，And what you realize。

Like if you do plow through and just jump in， Oftentimes it's just never bad。

You're like what the fuck was I even thinking，She's like hey，She's like hey。

Oh that's what I'm thinking，So don't buy into that little fantasy，That little projection。

And number two jump in，Don't wait for the logical reasons to jump in。

You're not gonna win that debate， Fucking jump in，Yes，So the best way is to brace it。

 And fill your way out of it，The best way is to move your foot，Right， left and say hello。

It's like don't even think，It's like your mind's gonna be like，No no no，And you're just like。

Just walking up，And then ideally，Yeah you can embrace it，You're like hey you know。

You can even say like，Hey you know I'm very shy，I was in my head，Picturing all this。

I thought you'd stab me with a bottle，It was something like that，You know。

And then laugh it in and then keep plowing，But this is what happens here。

So the girl walks next to me，Where are you but what after you see her？，I see her，I'm like okay。

She's here，And instead of being like，Hey，Like just，Hey，Just jump in，Like fuck，Like fuck，Like that。

Hey，We're gonna go talk to that，Now a guy comes in，And this is what you realize too。

It's like when you wait，Shit always gets worse，And your mind，And in the situation，Okay。

And this actually comes，You know kind of links to another big thing，When you get in your own way。

It's guys always want the perfect opportunity to open，Don't look for that，Just jump in。

The best option is just jump in，Okay，Whatever it is，Straightline， jump in。

Don't wait for things to be perfect，And as I mentioned before，To，Realize the girls，Look at，The macro。

Even if the opens a little messy，You fumble in，That's not the deciding factor。

If she's gonna fuck you or not，She's not like，Hey，Everything about you is awesome。

But that opener is just really sucked，It's the big picture，If overall you're good，She'll like you。

And she'll like the fact，You fumble a big，Because that's what adds that humanity。

And that's what adds that soul，If everything's perfect，You're boring，And you're robot。

It's just tap tap，So I'm there，And what makes it worse，Is having no one next to me，Being like hey。

Just tap tap her，Just do it，Like，Oh fucksin' out，There's a pressure too，Double pressure，Just tap tap。

Just tap tap，Fuck man，Like fuck man，Fucks，Like again，Tool in my head，And again if I keep thinking。

I'll just keep fueling that，Just tap tap，Fuck，Fuck maybe，Take the marriage，Just tap tap，It's so bad。

Excuse me，Excuse me，Bang，So I do it，This is like so bad，I'm just like，Excuse me，Excuse me。

All this build up，For what？ What's a reaction？，NickeD，July，Hi，Hi，Hi，That was it。

It's all in your fucking head，Okay，And the reason too we always assume，That it's gonna be bad。

Is you know，If we're not used to going out，And talking to all these people。

You're faced with the unknown，And as a former self-preservation，I always assume the worst。

So you're like，Oh it's gonna be horrible，No here's some proof，So every time this happens to you。

If you go through something similar，Take a，Like a second to actually pause，In GREUE。

In Gren this reference，It was not as bad as I thought，And the more you do this。

afterwill just kind of， Additionaly stop trying to，으면서，��，So there's， einen，Zong，Zong，係， Another one。

Girls walking， You，Reinde，So that's like，You，And， what happens，You， Get up， they're like，Uh。

they give up，It's like，This one try，You，I keep trying，Excuse me，You can do it，Come，鳴，音樂，旋律，音樂，飲起，即是。

 hey i'm not there yet you gotta make this relatable， 20k， what are you hearing LA。

 like oh what are you doing here in LA， i also don't view it as something bad remember if you if your state crashes with that。

 it shows you don't got that social awareness， it's like oh what are you doing in LA。

 you're aware of it but it's all good， stop viewing it as a failure if your move doesn't work。

 totally fine you're not identified with it your ego doesn't depend on it， what's this girl is here。

 i'm in the baby on here i watch shoe blood so i can take the accident。

 what i watch shoe blood so i can take the accident， my name is uh my name is jason sackhouse。

 sack god， Alabama， really， it's like really Alabama i'm like no。

 thank you i love you i love you more， oh my god， who the fuck are you， i'm， who are you， i hate you。

 oh my god， hold it， what i like about it is uh the setting of the rhythm。

 okay and this is also the offering value is i'm not trying to take i'm at the cause not the。

 effect always think cause not effect okay that's how you draw her in two。

 if i'm doing she's getting attracted if she's doing。

 she may be investing later on and getting you have to give her that space to do。

 but if you're asking for her to do she's not getting attracted she's not experiencing。

 you she's not getting to know you huge okay if i'm talking to you if i'm talking to you if i'm。

 talking to you i feel the same because i'm on the you're you're on the receiving end not me。

 if you talk to me you talk to me you talk to me i'll feel different depending on who's talking。

 because i'm reacting and experiencing you most guys go up to the girl like so talk。

 i heard you had to get a girl to talk so she gets attracted to you ask her interesting。

 questions so what about your dress talk about your dress get attracted。

 she's not getting attracted when she's talking about her dress she wants to know what you're。

 about how do i feel when i'm on the receiving end of this dude do i feel good or bad。

 and my attracted or not and that's when you're generating so when i'm opening even if。

 if there's i love you i hate you da da da da da da da i'm generating i'm not asking for。

 anything okay you probably heard the old school 9010 rule you open 90% of the doing in the。

 beginning as you hers 10% once you hook then you can switch it to a good 5050 where you kind。

 of just both going back and forth experiencing each other taking that further but off the bat。

 she's like who the fuck's this and the only way she gets to know you is not logically but。

 emotionally through experiencing you through reacting to you and that only happens when you're at。

 the cause are you really up as you turn away that was cute now close your eyes no one will see。

 you trust me don't give the shitty american kiss give her real kiss i'll be sad for you。

 okay it doesn't matter sex my best friends are there okay do you approve。

 bang now this i love to because once again what's her goal not to seem like a slut so she would kiss。

 me but her friends there and this is a lot of rejection too is guys try to go for the kiss when。

 they're not aware of the girl's situation or they try to pull the girl when they're not aware of。

 her situation or they try to get a number without being aware of her situation she probably wants。

 to give you the damn number but if you put her on the spot like in front of all her friends like。

 so let me get your number everyone look she's going to be a slut here in front of all of you。

 number she'll be like why did you do this you want to see her again she wants to see you you。

 became an obstacle to her goal of you know seeming like a slut the same with a kiss just like。

 fuck i really like this guy i can't wait to kiss him in a bedroom where i won't lose value。

 when my friends won't judge me why is he trying to kiss me here my friends here or even not。

 necessarily right there her friends in the venue and she won't just want to risk it and then。

 guys just keep trying and get rejected so a good example there it's like no no my friends there。

 oh do you approve yeah boom kiss that's the only thing in the way she wanted to kiss me her。

 friends fucking there so keep that in mind if something's not going your way okay if it's not。

 progressing and you don't really know why what's the girl's goal in what way is this an obstacle。

 to her goal a question asked herself all the time okay be cool don't embarrass me in front of my。

 friends girl oh and the gum discussing you're done it was a man it was a man it was nice video。

 it was nice video it was nice video you're done goodbye forever now i also don't keep kissing okay for。

 me a kiss and this is big it's just a form of expression that's it it's just giving some value。

 it's like oh we know whatever it's like a high five it's not something where i finally achieved。

 the kiss and that's most guys you're trying to take to get to the kiss i got there and then。

 just keep kissing and kissing uh and that doesn't move the interaction forward that is not playing。

 to win that is blocking that expansion just stain on the kiss okay and you'll realize if you。

 become the make out guy she'll kiss you for a bit and then she will die down okay we kind of。

 did enough kissing now by or if you kiss too much it shows that you just really needed that kiss。

 the kiss is like uh kiss but let's keep building in the vibe okay there's a time and place to。

 start kissing heavily and then taking things further it's not here in the middle of the street。

 it's in a bedroom if you try to escalate too hard here lack of social awareness off-skilled。

 her goal you're done okay and don't read too much into a kiss um a kiss is really like a high five。

 can you pull a girl if you kiss her you know in the venue you meet her yeah can you pull a girl if。

 you don't kiss her yeah it doesn't matter if you kiss her it's cool it amplifies kind of the。

 you know physical chemistry uh if you don't kiss her she may also be wondering why didn't he kiss me。

 and now she invests and chases more so it's a win no matter what you do it's whatever you feel。

 like doing whatever's appropriate but don't get too hooked on it and don't think that's a necessary。

 step to then bring in a girl home bring her home kiss her in your bedroom how old are you 20 I'm 17。

 hey I'm 17 this is my best time what is that， I'm so much sad she loves me what's your racial background yeah I'm an asshole now this is funny。

 I'm like what's your racial background it's like I'm Mexican and that's something Owen said to。

 right before so her friends like hey don't steal his lines again most guys are kind of freeze。

 like no I'm not what's my default yeah I'm an asshole I would say this all the time yeah I'm。

 an asshole your shirt sucks yeah I'm an asshole doesn't even make sense just like I embrace it doesn't。

 affect me yeah I'm an asshole makes me more attainable yeah my mom got it for me okay you。

 should have like temporarily as training wheels these little go-to's whether she throws。

 at you so you don't panic yeah blah blah blah blah and brace make it part of the plan make it。

 seem like she helped you kind of because you wanted to say I'm an asshole thanks for providing this。

 so I can say I'm an asshole I'm not I'm not a little bit。

 oh my god no I'm very I'm very abusive very molested。

 I love that no I'm like this I'm like does that hurt is that okay。

 now this one this is an old open you'll see me all young in it and what I found。

 I'm using at the time is kind of acting like I'm emotionally overwhelmed kind of like oh my。

 god whoa what like that now the key here is it's not necessarily what I'm doing it's how I feel。

 about what I'm doing this here is what made me feel good this is me gaming myself this is me。

 hitting on the fun button and that's why she gets drawn in and that's the value I offer。

 guys would look at this like oh it's the move the gets hurt no it's how I feel about the。

 oh and move I'm sorry I'm sorry， hi hi I didn't say the one， I'm sorry，我知道，我知道，我愛她，我保持 mit you。

我們這片子，我會賺出，也沒有人，因為一切，看到我，也散在巧合，從我到我，不准說，我有錢，不是， and every girl too has a bici front at some point will open up。

 that too is don't buy into the front， Okay， beneath that front with the right guy she's the sweetest girl ever。

 And I was a complete shift in the vibe， It's pretty much like okay。

 who is this guy where do we stand is he cool as soon as it clicks？， Oh， you're cool， okay？

 How's it going？，OK，好，我都知道，我都知道，你怎麼知道，我都知道，好，好， another mixet，two guys， girl。

 always straight to the girl，OK， in terms of being real， you're not there to talk to the guys。

 you're not hitting on the guys， the fact that you're going up to the guys， to get to the girl。

 is not being real， it's manipulating， open the girl， and then， be aware of the surroundings。

 think of her goal， she's there with her friends， sometimes you'll have to say。

 you know you'll probably have to say， hi to friends， like how's it going。

 oh hey nice to meet you too， nice to meet you too， but it's clear， I'm here for the girl。

 you should always have， a， quote unquote target， it's creepy as that sounds， they should know。

 why you're there， they should know which one you like， and which one you're hitting on。

 it has to be clear， OK， so me， boom straight to the girl， you， and a。

 communicate a lot of value to the girl too， it's like who the fucks this guy， is like so again。

 don't underestimate the value of authenticity， it's like who's this guy。

 is the ball is just walk up straight to me， you， where will we go， bye， I saw you。

 and I had to tell you， two minutes to it， I know， I'm such an asshole from pulling my way。

 he's like dammit， fuck that guy， who are you， what's your name， French， closer， we， stood at this。

 said you， says you， another one， girls at a bar， with a guy， is buying her a drink， open the girl。

 always open the girl， I have a beard， that's my open， check this out， I have a beard。

 it doesn't have to logically make sense， it's just check this out， it's OK， real man's beard。

 who the fuck are you， what's your name， tell your boyfriend， I'm your friend， yeah， say it。

 say just a friend who takes a shopping， hi， say he's just a friend who takes me shopping。

 now what does that do as well， it also communicates a lot of social awareness， because。

 every girl has that little friend， who takes some shopping， it's basically like the little。

 choked orbiter guy， so the fact that you even know that， and suddenly you mention it。

 like oh just tell my， little choked orbiter guy， shows that I'm on the end， shows that you know。

 value， I don't mind， I'm right， I'm right， I was just， you know， I was just a， why don't you， wait。

 I don't， wait， wait， wait， that was just a， pineapple， why don't you， find apple back。

 find apple back， I don't have to， find apple back， you don't have to， find apple back。

 you don't have to， only nail， must have a， model with you， always， so， so， that's why I was， OK。

 you're， OK， no I don't， I don't， I don't， I don't， b Wait， a minute， a minute， b， bang， so I go in。

 I'm not reacting， either， a lot of guys will react， to this， I'm cool， about it， one move。

 guys will， kind of try to make on you， it's like， oh do you want to drink， they're trying to。

 gilt you into， supplicating， i don't want to， fuck them， I'm， OK， no， no，你快來說不用了。

I don't wanna report，那下次就應該，。。。，我不要，我稱呼司，拿下，駕照，只買苦，就是不要，也有，那 (# pricing，是吧？，乾杯，很懷疑，綦給你， aeropinkles。

勾言，興趣，可以，我們有多點，開發，乾杯，OK，and what does that mean for pulling， usually the guys who are friends。

 they sometimes like want a fucker， so they're going to be like no for the pull。

 so you're probably going to have to settle for a number， and they might even say no for the number。

 so it's an easy way to get the number， hey can I say goodbye to you seconds。

 so as I say communicate to the guy， ok he's leaving he's saying goodbye， at just two seconds。

 ok I'll give him two seconds to say goodbye， he's leaving。

 and now it gives you like a little bit of time， to quickly get the number discreetly。

 to text her and fuck her later， and he's gone， sleeping， think it ever， ok so that's why I do here。

 and then turn her away from him， so she doesn't see it， she doesn't see how he doesn't exist。

 two minutes， that's all right， I'll step the mouse hold， oh boy， I just met him， girl sitting down。

 I walk up， or I'm out， ok， hand of god， check this out， check out my hand， what up？ Hello。

 who are you？， stand up， stand up， two minutes， stand up， stand up， two minutes。

 ok I just want to say hello， hi， it's like a dog， you're parking， you're a microphone， no no no。

 they will not leave without you， who are you？ what's your name？， Julian， Julian nice to meet you。

 are you from Hollywood？， they say no， oh my god where， Chicago。

 they will come and grab you don't worry， I think they're gonna yell at me at a second。

 ok that's the kind of thing， thank you what's your， I'm asshole， I like your bluntness。

 I like your bluntness， I like the fact you just walk up， you know what you want。

 you go for what you want， ok， and just be aware here too， on the more， you know。

 logical side of say， playing the paradoxes， a lot of what I'm saying is， addressing concerns。

 just two minutes， just two seconds， don't worry， your friends will not， leave without you。

 don't worry， we'll be right back to your friends， whatever it's like， I know she's thinking。

 she's like， first thing she does， I open she's like， looking at her friends， looking at the couch。

 that's not making me， my goals I say， my friends， are probably leaving soon， address those concerns。

 get rid of their concerns， so she can fully， focus on you， and take the vibe in， oh that was cute。

 oh god， oh god， smoother， it's like， I'm smoother， ok， and funny enough， too a lot of my verbals。

 kind of links that same， creative skillset， where time is using， should this happen， you know。

 associate other thoughts，脆痴明force，寻臉，情情离，噢，叶子，她在做，毒，再有， ME，誰，I'm just a man，I'm just a dog。

And a woman's body，Hi，OK，The value of authenticity，All the girls sitting，You，Hi，Hi，You，Oh。

It's in love，And then the fact too，that they're all fucking reacting，There's a lot of value。

Now what do most guys do，They'd see this，They try to look for the easy way in，OK。

Don't try to find the easy way in，Don't try to avoid Social Pressor， social press is good。

 what makes you grow， and the fact you can tolerate all this social pressure。

 is what also gets the girl attracted， like who the fuck is this guy， no one else can tolerate that。

 true love， send up to you seconds， Jay God， what is this in audition， brin， Essex， no I'm not。

 oi excuse me，no no no it's okay， it's okay just one step， one step is all accounts。

 i don't want to walk， no no just one step， one step， okay， um it's like with pulling。

 it's like give her the logical reason，让我一个小与你知，就会你好，这ends one，敲台，一个价 LesA，合纬，诼册，一切， associate，顾 分。

请离开，腰骨，心 Θ，前攻，你想结果，姿势，他不想，你能解�，那 while also mean socially aware。

 Because then there's the other guy who walks up who's not aware of all that， He's just like， Hey。

 murderer， Like， And then you come off as like a fucking weirdo， Like who the fuck's this。

 I'm still still doing it， Hi， Hello， Good， Sound up two seconds， Two seconds， Sound up two seconds。

 It's okay， Everyone's just like， What the fuck， Like， Here watching this。

 This just happens like in a few seconds time， When you're actually doing this。

 It feels like an eternity， You're like，Hello，Like that，Stand up two seconds，Like forever。

Are you from Australia？，Brucevin，Hello，Bruce Vegas，I haven't been in Australia for 16 years，Just。

Howdy， are you from Australia？，Oh no，Yeah， Bruce Vegas，What's this girl doing？。

She's getting her friend to stand up，So she can walk out and say hi to me，Brucevin，Brucevin。

 Bruce Vegas，All the way，Hello， I saw you，You did？，And I had to say hello，They all hate me now。

Thought I could have some other fucker，Who's that white boy？，Now that's two。

I also communicate some social awareness，Like， oh they all hate me now，They're like。

 who's that motherfucker？，Like， kind of addressing how weird it is，Like。

 oh all your friends hate me now，As a joke，Like， I know that there's a lot of，Social pressure here。

This is not，I'm not blind to it，I'm not some weirdo who's blind to it，Oh，Don't hate，Just say hello。

 Pretty much it's like all the principles of pulling， are in this，at the speed of like a machine gun。

It's like，It forces you to be like so on top of like that lower time of reactions， Ridiculous。

What am I doing？，I'm like just two minutes，Like leading，Take the pressure off， adding urgency。

I have to go，Two minutes， bring it down，Just two seconds，No， real fast，BOOM。
