# 泰勒基础与高级游戏RSD：正宗社交力学 DVD 8

高校校者，You know when girls are asking if you are player， i think that is a good direction。

 But when i started to notice is that， i don't get that anymore， which i think is interesting， So。

 i think that you get to a point where， you know things really。

 I've talked a lot about things coming full circle。

 I think that when you this point where it's truly who you are。

 That it's not verbalized anymore at that point， But， i mean are you a sales man。

就算是直到4多 Zhu，如果有重新考ank，放鍋上流，放鍋上流，中鍋也是，triple，ok so that's what I， that was my experience。

 when I went away from that kind of material， and when I went towards just more kickback， that's。

 that was really my experience， and it does take time not to get that initial indicator of interest。

 like when you're used to getting that initial indicator of interest， and you don't get it。

 can flip you out， but you know the， the work is worth the rewards， so I'd encourage you to try both。

 you know play with everything， I think it's good， do we have one more question before we ask you。

 that's the one I can say， that was a quick comment on like if you're in Starbucks。

 you know or something like that， you want to talk to a girl it's crowded。

 everybody's there watching you， you know， or for instance if you're in the mall。

 and you walk into a store， and there's a girl that you want to talk to。

 and you get a little conversation going， but then you know she's got to get back to work。

 so how do you end that one， and the one with Starbucks， how do you like dear， ok last question。

 the last one first， do you remember that qualification phone clothes thing， that I gave you。

 the where you say you know you've got to go back， you've got to go do what you've got to do。

 like you could switch you could modify it right， you've got to go back to your work。

 I've got to go back to my work， we weren't such busy people we could hang out longer。

 so you could take that same angle， to me， the shorter。

 that's something like the shorter the pick up， the more that you've got to like this is just。

 you know this is my penis different philosophies on this。

 so I encourage you to make your own decisions， but my opinion is， the shorter， the pick up。

 the more， non-committal and non-threatening， you want to make that phone number。

 right if I've only talked to a girl for two minutes， I barely know that girl。

 you know play the angle of you， you just seem kind of some kind of funky。

 interesting person I'm going to give you a call， because I'm impulsive， I'm just that kind of guy。

 I'm just a very impulsive kind of guy， that's the kind of， you might not want to verbalize that。

 but that's what you want to communicate， you're that kind of guy， then when you call her。

 she's like oh yeah there's that like fun guy， he's calling me， then you talk to her on the phone。

 now you've got a different situation， because you can really work on the phone。

 you see you're in person， you can do even better， but I mean in the end of the day。

 you know two minute phone number， it is what it is， right I mean it's it's a very unsolid。

 unpredictable phone number， and you can just call it and see what you think。

 because that's a that's a really awesome question， I love doing that。

 this is one of my favorite things to do， when I'm in when I'm in， let something like a Starbucks。

 and there's a girl there， if I use my voice properly， that's going to project over。

 everybody around me， they're all going to look， now we're playing with kind of playing with fire here。

 guys this is kind of tricky， alright so you got to really enjoy。

 you got to be doing this as a hobbyist， that's why you do it， so when you see that。

 and you go to open， what you'll see is she'll turn towards you。

 but a lot of time the entire room turns towards you， okay now if you go， like that， right。

 you're out of there， okay you're done， um， so what you do is you open。

 and you look her just the same way I'm looking at you right now。

 and everyone's going to be looking at you， you don't look at them， okay you just stay right on her。

 alright you stay right on there， and what's going to happen is her subconscious mind is going to。

 is going to process the entire room reacting to you。

 and it's also going to process that you're congruent to it， that you're an alignment with it。

 because by not responding to it， it implies that you get it all the time。

 like you're some kind of movie star or something， because the movie star who's used to have everyone staring at him。

 he's whatever goes by his business， because that's what he's used to on a day-to-day basis。

 the fact that he's a movie star is not what's attracted to the girl， it's his social proof。

 so if you can talk to that girl and people are looking， and your voice doesn't change。

 and you just keep doing exactly what you were doing， you see attraction goes through the roof。

 it's ridiculous， it's so funny， it's very very， it's comical。

 right if you guys have ever read like the workshop testimonials， where guys say some crazy thing。

 they said that's the kind of like silly stuff that we do， it's actually very easy to do。

 but from a guy who's never seen it before， he's you know he's pretty thrown， pretty shocked by it。

 right because the thing is， when you when you do that， you just 100% congruent to it。

 her state will shoot up like you have never seen， I've even seen girls。

 okay you you guys might recognize this， you guys who go out a lot。

 when a girl goes really insane she starts clapping， you guys ever seen that one。

 have you ever seen it， guys some of you guys have seen it。

 or sometimes if they're if they're sitting down， look like this， like that， like that's hilarious。

 and I totally tease them on I go， like that right just bust them on it， because。

 yeah when you say something that girls think is hilarious， they'll do that right。

 they'll do like these funny little， funny little thing like you you pump my state well。

 like that totally weird thing， so yeah I mean with the Starbucks one look。

 I mean I do you know what I do the same kind of thing on buses， right if I ever take a bus。

 you know I travel sometimes， sometimes faster take the bus， I'll get on the bus。

 and immediately as I get on the bus， I'll be joking around with the bus driver。

 so I'll be joking with them， and the girls the girls you'll see the girls heads turn up。

 you see the guys heads turn up too， if you guys don't talk about like just you know， some big dude。

 some interesting looking guy gets on the bus， everyone's just kind of curious they look。

 and so as I walk through， that's kind of that wanted， that sort of wanted attitude that you have。

 where you know you just kind of you know， you just kind of walk on。

 and you just kind of look around， everyone can see you， you know they're looking at you。

 right you're cool with it， you might make little comments， you make a little joke。

 that person starts laughing at it， everyone sees it， and the girls are all looking。

 the girls are all hoping that you'll sit beside her， then you go sit beside that girl。

 she's probably going to either open you， you say one little thing what's up。

 bang you've got attraction， because you've got those people reacting to you。

 and they're not reacting to you like in a freaky way。

 but you know they're reacting to you in a kind of a cool way。

 so I think that I mean that's that same thing， with Starbucks you can play that up。

 and if you play it up， yeah you'll see a you'll see a very interesting result。

 isn't that girl going to be nervous， that's why I always talk to her， and she's going to be nervous。

 here do you here， re ask why don't you want to re ask that question with the mic， yeah， so quickly。

 I was just wondering about the girl， that's what I always thought。

 you know that I'm going to start talking to this girl， that everybody's going to be looking。

 so that she's going to get nervous， yeah， and then the whole thing just gets。

 well if you hit on her， publicly then yes， if you hit on her publicly then。

 you put her in a situation， this is why I'm kind of against like hitting on girls。

 right because if you hit on her， then it's obviously just an approach。

 but remember if you if you don't say anything， that's hitting on her。

 as far as the other people are concerned， it's just your friend， you see。

 so also what you'll also kind of find， when a girl really goes into state。

 she kind of forgets about a lot of things， she just kind of。

 she's kind of in this world that you pulled her into， it's kind of interesting。

 like you know you can start talking to her， and she'll just get so sucked into it。

 if anyone else tries to talk to her， she won't be able to hear them。

 it's very very interesting stuff， and you know it sounds， it's my sound weird， my sound tricky。

 but just like a lot of， you know illusions or anything else out there。

 they're a lot simpler than they seem， like if you actually tried to do what I said。

 and you tried to do it like 10 times， by the 10th time you would you'd be like， oh yeah。

 you know you'd be like， oh yeah I'm getting it， like you you'll figure it out， you know。

 so yeah give it a try， yeah sure you'll enjoy it， when you're thinking of new material。

 and taking it to， to another level， what is the mindset you're using， or your thought pattern on。

 new material， well in the sense of like， well you know jealous girlfriend， how can that be。

 taken to another level， or different made into different material， okay well， um。

 okay the first thing that I would say is， avoid saying I need a female opinion， before your opener。

 I really like that I need a female opinion， I think it's really cool but。

 you know now that it's becoming so common， you know I'll avoid that。

 um you know other ones are just asking， quick short questions， right asking for a song name。

 you can't you know， you can't copyright that one， right you can't， you know you can't。

 you know normal guys ask those kinds of questions， so I mean for me I think the biggest transition。

 uh for stuff like that， you know if you want to stick with that kind of structure， is just uh。

 dumb it down a little bit， some fly a little bit， modified a little bit， I mean。

 you know you're smart you're smart guy， I know you can do it， for some guys。

 that might require a bit more creativity， than is within their capacity， but the fact of matter is。

 if they lack that creativity， that's probably the area， they should be working on anyway， so。

 yeah but I mean for me， I really move towards the style， as passive as possible。

 and focusing more on the body language， the confidence， the state， that kind of thing。

 because you know the secret's out， right so， you know， as well just see what else we can do。

 try and figure out， no one else is going to do it， I know that， so I figured me and the。

 me and the RSD boys， might as well figure it out， and you know you mean out on， a couple boot camps。

 and you've probably seen them doing that kind of stuff， and seen the results with it。

 so yeah we can get a phenomenal result with that too。

 pretty similar to when we used to do a lot of structure， so it's kind of cool。

 I'm going to go over a couple more abstract concepts， and then what we'll do is after that。

 we'll wrap it up， with some practical stuff， and just and finish it out， oh and by the way。

 before we do that， you had a question， about how to manage， multiple relationships。

 over a while in school， over it yeah， so he has what's called a quality problem， he has more girls。

 and he can handle， you're juggling right now， um， different people have different opinions on this。

 uh。。。， some of the different schools of thoughts on this。

 see I've personally always had trouble with it， you know it's hard to keep up with all that， so。

 I've heard different schools of thoughts， some people say that。

 you should tell the girls straight out， I'm seeing other people， now I've done that。

 and what happened to me， in a couple different cases， was the girl who I told that to。

 at first she's like， she's like what does that mean， right she's kind of you know。

 you're seeing other people， and then I sold her on it。

 right I still you know be free to sold her on it， and then she just goes out and hooks up with like five guys。

 in like three weeks， right and then what happened， in one case that would happen she did that。

 and then she starts crying， oh god I'm a slut， what have you done to me。

 and then she just started dating one of those other guys， don't mean， and that was it， so。

 that one sucked， uh。。。， you know but， you know I've seen other times， especially when you travel。

 a lot of the time when you travel， if that girl can feel that you have no expectations from her。

 then a lot of the time she'll be very comfortable with that， because。

 you know she knows that you're kind of just in and out， so you'll see that kind of thing， um。

 you know it's kind of tricky to do without her feelings， some girls can handle it， some girls can't。

 uh。。。 you know a good friend of mine uh。。。， Alex， really great with women。

 and he always has a few different girlfriends going and usually they're all， heartbroken。

 they're all just like， you know but it makes them like a more。

 and you guys might think right now all that's all that's so tight。

 like i've got all these girls fighting over each other， and they're all said they want me。

 it sounds good， you guys might think that breaking up with someone is like。

 yeah it's better to break up with someone than to be broken up with， uh。。。。

 breaking up with people sucks， when you break up with a girl and you see her hurt。

 and that's like your girl who you spend time with， that is heartbreak， man that sucks， so。

 yeah I think you know as far as how to handle that。

 the general way that you know the general school thought on it is be open about it， uh。。。。

 you know be just be real about it， and a lot of girls will accept it and a lot of them will but i've also seen things go。

 go wonky so， i don't know this be my experience， you know because that's one thing i always try to speak from experience。

 and so you know i've seen what other people are doing。

 but if it's not something that i did i'm not going to pass it off as you know i did that。

 for me i've personally had pretty consistently poor luck， with that but with girls that are um。

 that understand that it's casual uh。。。 you can have a lot of luck with that that can be fine。

 if girls are cool with that， it's fine the thing with you i think， is uh。。。。

 are you like you're like a fairly well established guy。

 so the thing is that you're listening a lot of those provider triggers。

 in that in those girls right， it's like if you were like a you know a twenty twenty one year old guy kind of。

 right around a motorcycle， um。。。， you know you're gonna be getting a very different response。

 but what's probably happening with you is you're pulling these girls hooking up。

 with them in the whole like lover frame like the you know the seducer frame。

 but then once they go out a couple times they see what you could provide for them。

 and it starts triggering those other things， starts triggering different instincts。

 i've had that exact same experience， where， i'll start dating a girl， and it'll be cool at first。

 like when you first are dating a girl， and you have just you know you've slept with her within like three hours of。

 meeting her， and you're that like that hot guy that just。

 you know you just pulled her in your yard and you're like almost more like a， fantasy。

 you could take that girl and you could be and you know you might have not even had a。

 real conversation with her yet because everything is just all like playful and。

 just crazy and you could say to her we're gonna go out we're gonna get another woman， tonight。

 and she'll be like okay done you know and she'll go out with you。

 and she'll help you do that because it's all fantasy it's all it's all crazy。

 but once you've actually started to be real with her like you know get to know her really。

 well and she knows you and you've brought out those， those domestication instincts。

 man you suggest something like that， how dude， right that's not cool you know so i mean unless the girl is like legitimately。

 bi right so yeah i mean there's a different you know there's different。

 things but i you know i'm not gonna claim an expertise on that area because。

 you know i'm in my first real relationship right now。

 i'm really enjoying it learning a lot from it so， you know i would like to maybe talk about my relationship experience。

 and some other product at some point and even then i'll probably admit it's。

 limited you know but i've learned a couple things about relationships。

 give us a couple of minutes because you know there's no other， empty relationship。

 uh okay the bit okay if i were to give my quick five minute run down our。

 relationships is that you guys want to hear about this or yeah yeah okay um。

 okay well i have a girlfriend uh Roxana some of you guys have met her。

 um she comes out on bootcamp sometimes helps out real aggressive if you guys。

 have met her uh she's ladden so she likes guys that dominate， that's what she likes。

 whenever she'll see a guy who's either more alpha than me or better look in。

 the me she starts getting cranky all right that's what she'll do she'll get。

 very testing cranky i tell her this all the time she denies it。

 but over and over she does is extremely predictable so。

 what'll happen is like you know we'll be watching some like sports show or。

 something she'll be attracted to some guy and i'll know this even though she。

 doesn't say it's obvious and then of course she'll get cranky with me。

 now if i start if i started indulging it like let's work through it。

 work through the problems then of course she gets more angry。

 it goes crazy so i can't do that so with Roxana um you know i'm a lot more。

 likely just to be like are you fucking crazy， okay on the ass not a bit so so that's what she wants right it's like when。

 she gets up aty with me she just wants me to， reassert dominance that's what she wants she doesn't want me to be passive。

 she very much wants me to reassert dominance um but bear in mind i think one of。

 the reasons why i've had success so far in my relationship is because i've。

 done the things that i said i'll do like i have been very reasonable i'm。

 being reasonable in my relationship as best as i can if she has an issue like。

 you know i'll hear it out i'll listen to it you know if i screwed up i'll。

 apologize i think a lot of guys lack the ability to apologize for a。

 place of power like if i've done something wrong i'll be like。

 you know that was terrible i apologize and we won't do it again。

 if she keeps going with that hey i apologize to you okay what's going on。

 right oh no it's okay it's okay right she'll chill out so you know i think。

 you know i think the real reason um why i've had success in my relationship。

 is probably because i'm very focused on what i'm doing very very focused on。

 on real social dynamics uh so whenever she she kind of messes with my head。

 in any you know accidental way i'm sure she doesn't do it on purpose but。

 you know whenever she does something messes with my head the way that my mind is。

 computing it is how does this affect rsd and you know how to fix rsd it。

 doesn't at all right it has no effect on it so when she does that i don't have。

 a strong reaction to it and if i'm doing something wrong i can admit it。

 but for the most part i have no reaction that's what uh david data who wrote。

 the book the way of the superior man he calls that being on your purpose。

 and your purt he says what david data says that your purpose cannot be your。

 woman because if your purpose is your woman then the thing that attracts her to。

 you is gone because you've lost that polarity between masculine and。

 feminine energy so because i feel like because i have a you know strong sense。

 of purpose um i can stay on that path but at the same time。

 in a relationship and some of you guys might have experienced this if you're。

 very focused on your business a lot of stressful things can happen in your。

 business and if you take that if you let that stress。

 carry over into your relationship time you're done that will completely。

 strip your relationship a woman and this is actually i think another thing。

 david data says that completely matches my experience a woman would rather。

 have a now and a half a day with you where you are quote-unquote fully。

 present where you are there for her and you're listening to her and you're。

 really with her then 10 hours a day where you're kind of distracted。

 kind of focusing on other things so it's like you know with my girlfriend。

 you know it's like i kind of like the fact that i have to take a break from work。

 and enjoy some time with her because it forces me not just to work all the time。

 so with her um you know i'll try to be really there for just have have a good time。

 just really enjoy the interaction and of course she craves that because it's so。

 much fun so yeah i think that's why we have a good relationship i'm just i'm。

 doing what i'm doing i'm not really too worried about anything that's coming。

 from her um if it's legitimate i'll admit it i'm very。

 reasonable i try to do the things that i say that i'll do i don't promise。

 anything that i'm not going to do and uh yeah i mean she you know she'll。

 follow me anywhere you know i took her back to Kingston this year。

 a little town in the middle of the snow uh living in a little room。

 for you know for college and she seem to enjoy it so oh and one last thing before。

 i move on from it i really made sure that she's growing so i think that a。

 couple that stays together grows together so because i'm always evolving i。

 make sure she's always evolving so for example when i go to the gym a lot of。

 guys will say i can't get my girlfriend to live with me because uh because。

 the girls then they're gonna get huge which if only it was that easy。

 and um you know and uh like i don't want to look like a big stereo is guy。

 yeah awesome i don't even look like a big stereo guy thanks so。

 so the thing is um you know if i say let's go to the gym i'm not gonna say。

 okay honey you know you're not gonna look like a big stereo is guy。

 i'm just i'm gonna go what come on right just let's go right just bring in the。

 gym here lift this it's heavy just lifted okay but just tell her what you。

 want and then she's like okay okay it does it because she likes that sort of。

 commanding um but i also you know i'm you know i you know i you know i。

 courage her to read good books get her to work on her own career uh she。

 she used to smoke she quit smoking she doesn't drink um how did i。

 mix out smoking simple just don't do that stop stop right just mix it out。

 some women are not gonna put up with that though that some women will not go。

 for that remember she's ladden she mexican so she comes from a different。

 culture than a lot of american girls some american girls are not cool with。

 that my previous relationship before uh Roxana， um was a girl from my hometown and i remember that if i was aggressive with。

 her whoa she was freaked out i remember once even being at a club and she was。

 sitting in this direction and i was sitting in this direction。

 and i remember her saying me i thought this was interesting she said to me。

 you're you're like leaning into me you're like it's unattractive。

 because some girls they really want you to be in your own reality。

 they want you to be doing what you're doing and they want to be the ones that。

 chase you around like an oak tree they're like the squirrel running around the。

 oak tree if you start to act like the squirrel， traction gone right some girls don't even want you to initiate sex they want。

 you to just go about your life and when they see you doing that they get。

 attracted and then they'll initiate it other girls are passive they want you。

 initiated so you can sort of get a sense whenever you data girl what makes。

 for attracted what qualities make her attracted， and then from that point i don't think that you should necessarily react to it。

 i think you have to come to a decision of whether or not that matches what。

 you're about enough that you want to stay with that girl。

 because the number one mistake the guys say they say how do i keep that girl。

 i want to learn relationship game i say screw relationship game。

 because if you're in a relationship you should just be doing whatever you。

 naturally do maybe being a bit more considerate you know some of the stuff i。

 talked about here but for the most part if you're having to change。

 yourself on the long term just to keep a girl there that sucks。

 that is terrible relationship no matter how hot the girl is you should be。

 enjoying it and enjoying each other with a more natural size of your。

 personality and what i see a lot of guys do with the tend to do。

 like as a you know learning to get good with women you wind up hooking up with。

 like if you know you want to go like a rating style here which i think is kind。

 of a notch but i'll just use it uh you know say you you'll you'll grab get a。

 bunch of sevens right you get a lot then you get like the odd eight but then as。

 soon as you get a nine you hear it you hear it same thing。

 i actually like this girl that's the person to say i actually like her like as。

 if they should have to use it or actually to justify they like a girl and then。

 they say they'll say uh i want to keep this one this one's a keeper。

 and we'll try and keep her even though they probably dated girls who would。

 have been way better in a relationship previously。

 let me tell you this you know i really i'm very physically attracted to my。

 girlfriend but at the same time once you've been in a relationship for about。

 half a year i don't know man they they pretty much all look the same their。

 personality is what is what's going to be doing it for you so if you don't like。

 your girlfriend's personality it doesn't matter what she looks like i think。

 Dennis Romney was the guy that said you know for every hot girl you see there's。

 some other guy sick of fucking her and you know it's the gods on his truth。

 um you know when you're with the girl for a long period of time it's no。

 longer about you know the physical traction it's about she's your friend you。

 have a you work you bounce well off of each other。

 and you're basically like more or less best friends that's what it comes down。

 to so to me that's you know that's where relationship。

 uh we can really shine when you're both growing from it um。

 let me go back to that whole value-taker concept for you guys。

 value givers versus value-takers so i said to you guys a value-giver。

 is someone who offers value just by their individuality。

 by their presence imagine we had um you know someone who has a really cool。

 guy is in this room and just by him being here that is offering value to the。

 room that's offering um you know making the room a better place。

 that to me is what offering value is about more importantly。

 offering value is about dictating a vibe around you。

 this is very important stuff you gotta understand this。

 when you're approaching a woman and you're joking around her。

 it has to it has to be the case that you're joking around her because。

 it's something that you like to do you like to dictate a certain vibe around。

 you you like to dictate you know the emotions that go on around you。

 that's really what it comes down to when you do that。

 and you're joking around with that girl she knows is real。

 she knows that that's that's just who you are， so you're not giving your power away。

 when you guys think about that let's think about， what is the definition of giving away your power does anyone have any。

 any suggestions on that anyone want to take a stab at it， what it means to give away your power。

 do you power someone else to be put someone else like on a pedestal in that sense？。

 yeah here why don't we do we gotta get those mics like super sprint。

 yeah okay so what do you think could be an example of giving away your power。

 you put someone else on a pedestal you you you overvalue everything that they。

 say and kind of devalue what you are and who you are about。

 yeah it's like you let your own sense of who you are be affected by their。

 reaction to you right yeah that's a great example does anyone have any， any other tab from that？。

 give away your hand， your hand in the steering wheel of whatever's going on to someone else。

 absolutely yeah and yours， want to throw your what was yours giving away your identity？。

 yeah giving away allowing them to dictate your identity to you， yeah definitely。

 to me giving away your power， you can offer value without giving your power away because you know that you。

 have your own things going on that's key you know you have your own things。

 going on even in that even in that club you've got your own things going on。

 you don't need anything from anybody， you'd be dictating that exact same positive vibe around you。

 whether other people were there or not， so that that girl knows that if she were to walk away from you。

 you'd still be having the exact same fun if she weren't there。

 that is what it means to not give away your power。

 that she understands that you'd be having that same fun whether she was there or。

 not it's very attractive very attractive quality because it makes you。

 uncontrollable and it makes you someone whose validation she would want。

 a sort of working model for this that I came up with that really helped me。

 was this this was this was something that really helped me I don't know how much。

 this will help you guys but this this helped me tremendously by just。

 keeping this in mind it really really kind of changed things for me。

 that's this in any social interaction， there is not two spaces but three spaces。

 so most people think you know there's you there's the other person。

 that's like two spaces you're both talking but kind of like a you know a way。

 of thinking about it is that there's actually three spaces there's three。

 spaces in any interaction there's you there's the other person。

 and then there's that sort of empty emotional space in the middle where。

 and fall this where both of your value dangles， so try to fall me here your value dangling so you look at a woman。

 hog girl she's always got that sex that value of having sex。

 it's dangling in front of you it's sitting there it's right in front of you。

 how about someone who has access to a cool party or celebrity celebrity could。

 you know you know open up your world for you a little bit。

 and you're talking to them and it's dangling right in front of you。

 um for for me let me tell you know a bit as my own life。

 I have this kind of weird uh situational value that I have for um teaching。

 guys pick up so when I meet guys out on the street a lot of the first。

 thing they'll say to me is they'll start asking me for pickup tips。

 so it's like that's you know that's kind of like my values I might have some。

 kind of knowledge and some guys might be curious about it。

 what's interesting and this goes for anyone that teaches dating I'll just。

 give you guys a little insider secret here anytime that someone comes up to you。

 and asks you and talks to you about pickup you probably won't make friends with。

 that guy you probably won't but whenever someone who knows。

 that that you run like a like a dating company， will come talk to you they don't bring it up at all。

 you're you're like I want to be friends with that guy it's always like that。

 it's always like that and it made me realize that it must be how girls feel。

 because it certainly is the way they respond is when you can talk to a woman。

 and it's like that value of sex is right there in front of you。

 it's right there but you're completely unaffected by it。

 you're not going to try to jump into that space right。

 because that is what the value taker does they jump into that space they're。

 jumping into it when you jump into that space， and this is how I like to think about it this sort of like my my way of。

 thinking about it they have no way to move towards you。

 this is you know we're getting kind of kind of philosophical。

 mindset here but what I'm saying is that， if you think about attraction like you know attraction is almost like an。

 energy when you talk to a woman and you're completely。

 unaffected by the fact that she could probably give you some。

 really hot sex and also probably what a lot of guys want which is a。

 validation you know the validation of having a hot girl friend。

 everything that goes with having that girl and you can just talk to her。

 almost like as a person or even just like you know teasing her even。

 tooling her but whatever it is just funny just doing what you'd be doing。

 anyway and not be affected by it she feels that empty space and she is。

 compelled to jump into that space and to try to get your value which you know。

 as a fun guy or whatever that is she's compelled， drawn into that drawn into that space you know when I really thought about。

 that whole and I said this is kind of like why really help me。

 when I thought of that whole like there's always three spaces。

 whenever I talk to somebody like whenever I'm talking to anybody now。

 you know I can feel their value I might even be having an emotional response。

 to it for what I can get out of it but I've consciously decided I'm not。

 going to jump into that space and so when I talk to them you know I think I。

 communicate more powerfully because of it because it's more real。

 I'm just communicating with them and especially somebody who's used to。

 having people wanting things from them whenever someone is very very used。

 to having people want something from them， part of their reality is putting people into a box。

 putting them into a bin take a hot girl she's always used to。

 to guys want to get sex from her if you come along and you're not。

 going for it by you know doing all these like little subtle things。

 to try to impress her whatever it is she's going to feel that and she's going to。

 say to herself I'm hot I'm still hot I'll make this guy want me。

 and this is this is really messed up but happens all the time any of you guys who。

 go out a lot of all seen it I'm sure when that girl wants to make you。

 attracted to her she will have sex with you she has to but she will。

 damn will make you attract to her that's what she decides she decides you。

 know I'll give you know I'll give my phone number whatever it is it's the。

 same thing if you guys ever live in LA and you see some kind of movie。

 start and you just go talk to them and you just you just real with them you just。

 talk to them you just talk to them as people not as objects not as objects to。

 take value from but as people they're all they will always invite you to sit。

 with them they will always want to hang out because it's so rare。

 that they can get that experience of being treated like as a person。

 that they'll want to be around you now this is kind of like one of those。

 full circle concepts because of course one of the most。

 chump concepts is women you know women are all beautiful we have to treat。

 them as a real person not go for it and that's like a that's like a。

 you know a supplication frame that's kind of a chumps frame。

 then you know you kind of get to the point where you know you learn how to。

 ball bust a bit you know you learn how to play with them that kind of stuff。

 and of course you get a far far better result doing that。

 but when you actually can get to a point where you're doing this stuff really。

 passively you can talk to them and you know you can joke around it's like I。

 said right like you have this sort of style about you that you've internalized。

 over a couple years or you just joke around them you just talk to them like in a。

 cool way there's cool parts about your personality that you know that people。

 likes you never have to worry about it when you can talk to them like that。

 their immediate reaction is they want to hang out with you it's an immediate。

 thing it builds curiosity it also elicits that whole I'm。

 going to put him in his role thing where they were they basically do。

 anything to get it it's very interesting how that works but remember always。

 that sort of that three spaces philosophy because when you talk to someone if。

 you can always remember that you'll be amazed at how they will throw their。

 value at you when you don't reach for it because they're going to jump in that。

 empty space they're going to be leaning towards you one of the things about。

 even relationships they talk about is like when you have a relationship and you。

 do a girl a favor sometimes you notice that the girl loses attraction for。

 you afterwards and a guy named Vinny made a really good point I thought this。

 was really interesting he said the reason why she loses attraction isn't。

 because you did her a favor it's because when you did the favor you got more。

 invested in her and because you're more invested in her you're leaning。

 towards her emotionally more and as a result she's going to pull back。

 it's kind of interesting the idea that it's not the favor itself it's not the。

 action like the suit it's not the service level action that causes the girl。

 to withdraw it's what it does to your own head it's what it does to your。

 own psychology that sort of changes that that almost that magnetic energy。

 between you makes it makes her pull back I thought that was very interesting。

 now let's go into frame here's a really interesting one you guys have all heard。

 of blind spots right have you guys ever okay have you guys ever heard of the。

 word skatoma skatoma means this when you have a certain world view you need to。

 process the world in a way that aligns with that world view otherwise it can't。

 make sense some of you guys might have might have heard the old tale about。

 when Christopher I believe it was Christopher Columbus first came North America。

 and his ships were on the harbor that you know the Indians could not see the。

 ships they they were blind to it because the blind spot like to see the sea。

 they just couldn't process it it was too far outside of the reality to。

 process it if you guys start going down this whole。

 rabbit hole about learning what your blind spots are this will trip you out。

 this will trip you out like you don't even believe because when you remove blind。

 spots it can really screw your state up in fact when you remove a blind spot。

 because blind spots exist for a reason right they're existing to help you to。

 help keep your confidence so when you remove a blind spot it can really mess you。

 up with um I think I think actually guys like Anthony Robbins have。

 been accused of removing people's blind spots and people have total meltdowns。

 they just totally go nuts they try and assume just pretty only in an only。

 America but basically those blind spots that make up your confidence can help。

 you or hurt you let me give you an example， some of you guys might know people or might have even been yourselves。

 that are very um anti-sex anti-partyying that kind of thing。

 I remember you know being a kid and seeing my parents getting angry when the。

 people across the street were having a big party， but when you think about it that party wasn't disturbing anybody。

 the reason they're angry is because they're having fun and my parents are not。

 having fun so that's what's going on there at least in my opinion a lot of。

 guys will also um you know they'll hang on to a lot of really thick。

 moral codes and ethical codes like um for example a guy who can't get laid。

 and then rationalizes I never wanted to I have the standard of what kind of。

 woman I'll be with and so on and so on so forth， through different blind spots that blind spot is holding the guy back。

 because he's created this blind spot this totally weird identity he's created。

 that identity in a reaction to something it's not really who he is it's just a。

 creation that has come up with as a way to feel good about himself and I can。

 guarantee that every last one of you in this room。

 including myself have more blind spots than you can imagine。

 just tons and tons of blind spots different people processing is。

 differently I've seen two guys there's two types of guys that to me are very。

 very good at picking up girls two types that you'll see。

 the first type is the guy who lacks blind spots， he's a very strong calibrator so for example he could be talking to a woman。

 and he's seeing everything he's seeing the whole deal he's looking at how she's。

 responding to him he's feeling it and he's calibrating in relation to that。

 so some of you guys might have might have come from a place where。

 you know you tried to think of a come back for every single line that you could。

 get like every single thing could come up you come up with the perfect line。

 to come back with every you know you come up with the perfect solution for。

 everything and a lot of guys who do that are actually very very good with one。

 they calibrate very sharply now here's the other guy who's good with women。

 that is what you would call the strong frame guy， the strong frame guy is the guy who goes in there。

 and is so convinced that he's the man that even when the girls don't like。

 them he'll stick in there long enough they eventually will。

 right if you if you want me to open up a bit about my personal life。

 I'm the calibrator and Papa back there is the it's always on guy。

 he is he is very he is the epitome of the it's always on guy。

 because he believed that it's that is on and he's and he's 100% convinced of it。

 it becomes his reality in a lot of ways when you see one of the things you。

 guys might have noticed is I didn't talk that much about indicators of。

 interest during the seminar because believe me I have。

 lists of indicators of interest but one of the reasons why I talked about it。

 big because I want you guys to understand it one of the reasons why I didn't go。

 too much into it is something I realized， because if you know too much about indicators of interest。

 it can mess your head because you're always looking for them。

 you're trying to figure out is she interested is she not should I be。

 calibrating I think from a newbie's perspective， it's much better just to assume it's on if she's talking to you。

 it is on and that is that's probably she she's talking to me。

 we're hooking up that's how it goes down so that's the sort of like it's。

 always on versus kind of calibration now I think the strongest point。

 and it's the point that you know um you know I wouldn't say I've reached。

 yet but I'm trying to evolve towards it， is a third type a more rare type and that is。

 the type who sees what's going on， they don't have the blindspos but they're not emotionally affected。

 by what's going on they're able to still they're not emotionally。

 dominated by what's happening you know they can see they can。

 look out they can sense what's up they're like okay this is what's going on。

 but at the same time they're not affected by it they can still keep moving。

 forward they can keep that it's always on kind of frame。

 but it's a very interesting thing that it's always on frame。

 that it's always on belief you guys catch that it's always on any time you。

 talk to girl it's on because what that does is that even when the girls not。

 into you your state doesn't go down that's really what it comes down to。

 women are always waiting to see your state get shot down so they can。

 mix you out but as long as your state stays up， even if they even if they're not into you as long as your state stays there。

 sooner or later they will be it's a really big paradigm shift I was watching。

 a natural watching a natural while I was out， and you know I kind of subscribe to the whole the old the old rick H。

 belief always have a better answer， guess I might have heard that one the idea of always have a better answer。

 than uh then whatever that girl said to you， and I remember the girl really nailed him she just nailed him she got him she's just。

 bam got him and he was completely indifferent and he came up with a。

 comeback that was retarded was stupid I was like， owch that sucks but he just look as he said it he just looked at her。

 and because he was more confident than she wasn't what she said when she said。

 was damn good it went over and he took the frame back and he had her。

 and I looked at that I'm like damn it I'm like I got all these these like。

 lists of like tight answers to everything but when you look at this guy。

 he gave a very poor answer and he just believing it and boom problem solved。

 like I'm like damn it you know like all my lists of stuff worthless。

 right and you know it's not that it's necessarily worthless but you got to。

 think to yourself if you get in the habit of always having the best。

 answer that's a long term habit that you're going to cultivate and it takes a。

 long time to unwire that especially when you know you've got the best。

 answer so it's interesting it's a very interesting。

 sort of thing here about learning how to be good with women。

 sort of going between just saying fuck everything I'm just going to be。

 confident it's always on but at the same time you know maybe that's not the。

 best approach because you're going to be missing out a lot that could be。

 helping you so at the same time learning how to calibrate it's a very。

 interesting balance between that but I mean I guess really what I wanted you。

 guys to take from this is just that you know the it's always on frank and help。

 you and at the same time you know you can learn to get a sense of where。

 you're at and learn good responses but if you get into that reaction。

 seeking mindset we're always needing that same feedback from the girl all。

 the time you can really hold back your game so I want you guys to take that。

 from this anyway we've gone over some kind of some kind of more。

 a little bit more philosophical concepts here towards the end what I want to do。

 now is I want to just take a break about 10-15 minutes。

 we have covered a lot of ground being over a lot of different concepts。

 try to paint a picture for you guys of how an approach is done every element of。

 the approach that you need to know how to hook how to get the touch going。

 how to vibe how to qualify get the number venue change。

 right up until sex we've gone over that if you guys learn this if you take it。

 upon yourself to do this your level going in very good direction。

 in the same way that right now you guys will be able to approach you know you。

 guys most of you guys you could approach a woman talk to her for three。

 minutes you guys learn how to talk to her for five minutes。

 ten minutes and now her it will become a natural thing it won't be something。

 that you do it will be something that you are， if you stick at it I've emphasized sticking out of the lot in the seminar。

 if you stick at it you will get a phenomenal result most people have a。

 tough time with this process you will find a lot of roadblocks along the way。

 I had all sorts of roadblocks along the way but you know what's interesting。

 when you get to that roadblock something called reticular activation system。

 which means that you zero in on the things that will help you。

 it will help you to find the solutions that you need a lot of old books that。

 you've read you'll reread them under a different context you get all new。

 information out of them you'll find the things that you need if you become。

 mechanical you'll seek out people who are very natural and you'll learn from。

 them if you want to learn more stuff about mechanics you'll seek out the。

 people who have that you will your brain will figure this out for you。

 what it comes down to is intention that burning desire you know how bad you。

 want it that's what I that's what I would ask you guys how bad do you want it。

 how bad do you want to take yourself to that level。

 because if you do it will affect your life in all sorts of different ways。

 you guys know about our bootcamp program a lot of you guys in here have taken it。

 that's a program that we developed over four years so far four years and。

 running as of today constantly streamlining it improving it building upon it。

 I encourage you guys to check out realsocialdynamics。com look at it and see if。

 it's right for you and think about it and consider it。

 it's not a magic pill but it can take you a long way。

 you also have to be constantly working on yourself improving yourself。

 and using those things as resources not as quick fixes。

 read books I encourage you guys to read everything that you can about self-help。

 anything about spirituality take on a good healthy habits going to the gym。

 building a social circle building a life these are the things that are going to。

 contribute to your general happiness you do this for yourself。

 and the thing with women will be a part of that overall picture。

 this area for me as I talked about today has been。

 you know one of the most important things I ever did。

 and the confidence that I built building these skills gave me the confidence to。

 feel like I could do anything and that's what's given me the confidence to。

 push through some of the crazy things that have happened to me。

 not to worry about it and to come to a place of positivity。

 and a place where I'm not worried about what people think about me。

 that's what I really want to see from you guys， I want you guys after this program to do exercises。

 we talked about them to decide how many days a week you're going to go out。

 how many girls you're going to talk to and to follow it。

 in addition to that I'm going to call upon you guys to do a couple other exercises。

 and I'll mention them right now before we wrap up。

 another one and some of you guys don't understand this yet。

 but this is an old self-help exercise we can encourage you guys all to do it。

 because it'll change your life is the positivity challenge， very important what that means is this。

 for a period of time whatever you said say a week decide that you are only。

 going to allow yourself to dwell on a negative thought。

 for the 30 seconds two minutes whatever it is， and then you cut it off at the same time but I'm going to put a little bit of a。

 twist on it， while you're doing this make an effort to view everyone in a positive way。

 this is a really interesting one make an effort， so that everyone who you meet no matter how obscure。

 whatever positive qualities they have are， that you will decide to see that in them and you'll decide to focus on the。

 positive in them there's a million of one different reasons I could give you。

 for this everything from the fact that， it will condition you to be in a more positive state yourself。

 the fact that when you view everybody in a positive way。

 your world view changes to assume that everyone views you that way。

 and most importantly in my case you'll be able to learn from people。

 because when you view everyone as positively you can learn things from them。

 that other people will not see， the other one that I'm going to leave you with。

 is to make the decision not to care what people think about you。

 make that decision that any time that you catch yourself。

 caring what people think about you you'll mix it out。

 say that someone you know say someone gives you a lot of shit。

 and you find yourself responding to it ask yourself why am I responding to。

 this what's the point of it why am I doing this， and if it's because you care about what people are thinking about you。

 cut it off if you're talking to somebody， and you find yourself just subtly trying to impress them in some kind of way。

 cut it off if you can do that， and you can completely let go of negativity。

 and you can let go of scarcity feelings or worrying about what people think。

 about you that's bringing you one step closer to becoming what they call a。

 natural the kind of guy that naturally attracts women。

 doing this for me has you know yielded a result that。

 you know it's been so life-changing for me that it's just my。

 passion to teach this you know when I can give this to somebody else I get。

 I get a kick out of it I love it and I want you guys to have that。

 experience so what I've laid out for you guys here。

 this weekend is a course that you can take it's a path that you guys can walk。

 because one thing to know the path but it's another thing to walk that path。

 which is a lot more challenging so I want to encourage you guys to take the。

 energy that we built in this room to take a piece of it with you。

 after this program to walk the path and see where it leads you。

 because I think the place that's going to lead you。

 just be very empowering and be very happy so thank you very much guys thanks。

 for coming out。
