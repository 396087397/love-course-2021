所以我 thought to make this one here the 10th law， to just really hammer on the importance of not limiting yourself to just success with women。

 ok you should also apply all of this， ok apply 10 game to your life， apply this to your friendships。

 to your job， to different business relationships， to every single aspect of your life。

 ok if you're only benefiting in the success with women area， you're missing out on a lot。

 ok to kind of hammer this point at home too， I thought I'd kind of talk about my journey in the game。

 I found out about this almost 10 years ago now， originally from Switzerland。

 and I randomly read a book called The Game at the Time， ok and up until that point。

 the way I'd go about you know living my life is I was extremely shy， extremely introverted。

 just you know extremely anxious stressed paranoid。

 worried about what people thought of me and just walking around in a state of constant misery。

 every single day， you know and we rarely take time to just be aware of how we feel。

 I kind of just thought that was the default， like even right now if you're watching this you can do a little test like。

 go inside your body and notice like how do you feel， you know is there any tenseness。

 do you have a nod in your stomach， even as your body language a little bit tense or you fully relaxed or you fully at ease。

 try to objectively look at it， you know and be like hey if someone else was。

 feeling what I'm feeling right now， would that be an enjoyable experience or not。

 you know and for me， back in the day it was probably a three out of ten every single day。

 and I was just like well I guess this is just how things are。

 I didn't even think I could do anything about it， and I didn't think I had control over my life。

 I remember， you know falling into a lot of， victim mentality。

 tendencies where I was like why is this happening to me。

 I'd see other people just like way more successful。

 just having a way more of a blast in life than me。

 you know having all these awesome experiences like why me， you know and。

 you try to conform you think the more you conform， the more people you please you know maybe。

 things will turn out better and there's a lot of hope and really like， up to luck。

 and finding out about you know this whole success women community。

 reading that book the game at the time， just really blew my mind you know on one hand is like holy shit like。

 of course there's the girls， but going so much just further beyond that。

 it gave me a sense of control， we're up until that point you know you're you're really a victim of。

 circumstance you're just like you're in these different situations。

 and that's kind of what shapes you and you hope for better situations， with this here it's like hey。

 you can do something about this you know， suddenly your life， you know isn't your control again。

 and that's really， that was really like the appeal for me I was like holy fuck like。

 I can do something about this like， women holy shit and it starts with the women you know that's like the。

 lore it's like hey come for the women kind of like back in the day with。

 self-help you know it's like come for the money make money。

 but then you get into this and there's this whole other world。

 the same was successful women you know I went out， and I was thinking you know just women at first。

 and I was so shy at the time I couldn't even， make small talk with anyone I couldn't even ask an old lady for the time。

 walking down the street so you know it took a while。

 let me just going out of this anxious state so I finally was able to。

 go up and say hi to you know the the the first， girl stranger let's just say that in my life。

 and I remember doing that and it just， felt it was crazy okay like on one hand。

 I that was probably the first time in my life I really felt alive。

 like I remember I was walking down the street this after like you know。

 a couple months of just walking around just not being able to say hi to。

 anyone and this is like a two hours in I was like a bed like。

 saying okay I'm gonna go home walking around the street during the day。

 boom two girls like this is it finally said hi in that moment where it's。

 like finally said hi it's like something just took over like it wasn't even。

 me it was just like what's am I doing this I'm really doing this。

 all of my faculties were just like like active I was I was alive。

 there was that adrenaline that just feeling of like。

 yes finally and I finally said hi and it you know it didn't go anywhere。

 she's like hey how's it going uh at the time they were routine so I like spit。

 out like a few little canned like stories I memorized。

 and just left and although it didn't go anywhere in my mind I was like oh my。

 god like I got hooked on that feeling there and that feeling of you know just。

 being alive of freedom of just again just making sense。

 that's what motivated me it was never so much like oh the fear like。

 up until after that point it was never the fear the anxiety running away from。

 it was like I wanted that I was running towards that。

 and not only that but that was the first time too。

 where I started building that trust in myself you know it's like hey I can do。

 this because in pickup it really is especially for a guy like a。

 fucking right of passage you know from like boyhood to manhood where。

 you know there's not that much in your life the the way we're conditioned。

 to the society we live in where you know you you kind of can tap into that。

 sense of adventure um a liveness and it's really like that stepping stone where。

 you know in pickup you're there alone like no one's going to do this for you。

 it's like you're there alone and when it comes to a man it really taps into。

 something extremely primal and it's again you're， going to do it or not and you're there and there's the girl and you're like。

 holy fuck let's see and let's fucking it's like， make that leap and that's just like part one i'm like holy fuck I did this alone。

 this is like me it's like the most personal challenge you could ever give。

 yourself um and it just hits on such a deep level。

 and I just got hooked on this and I just wanted more and more and more so I。

 started going out putting myself in these different。

 different situations uh and started he started building like that self-trust。

 you know um as well as self-worth like in terms of what I deserve instead of。

 being like a victim like hey I can actually like you know start believing。

 myself and like maybe I deserve more maybe you don't have to be a。

 fucking victim so that went on for a good three years in Switzerland。

 just going out you know it's really like there were times obviously where it。

 wasn't a blast there were times where it was horrible and。

 scary but I was tried to keep like a really， positive attitude and remind myself about that first interaction like the。

 sense of adventure uh this sense of like just epic story like even though it。

 doesn't sound that epic if I think back now like that's probably one of my。

 favorite moments in this in my entire journey you know it's like that was it。

 that was the start um and uh just slowly building that self-trust you know。

 the trust in myself uh what I deserve uh that I can go for what I want that I。

 don't have to feel boxed in like slowly moving from scarcity to abundance。

 and it just went so far beyond just women you know this affected uh。

 just my life in general you know before that I was really going the route of。

 you know I'm gonna study Giga grades um you know I got into a really good。

 college my goal Giga grades at the college get a job get a。

 promotion get a promotion retire and die and that'll be。

 successful life and if I do that all right hopefully I'll be happy。

 and uh this showed me like hey you don't have to like suffer through it it's。

 like you can take control the same with women with your life。

 and this is what uh gave me the self-trust to move even to America you know from。

 Switzerland to America which was terrifying at the time and uh it was really。

 pickup and I remember thinking that I'm like holy shit like if I was able to。

 deal on my own with all these different situations with women which。

 again from where I was coming from and even as a guy it's like extremely uh。

 scary at times like it taps into something really primal like of course you。

 know I could do this moving to America there was that self-trust like I don't。

 really know how I'll do it but I trust that once I'm in that scenario once I。

 jump in I'll figure it out you know that self-trust in that sense of like I。

 deserve this um and that's really what kept pushing me。

 throughout my life to this day it all started with that first。

 fucking open um this applied to different friendships different。

 relationships um I would never have been able to even be in a relationship。

 without pickup you know because we think from an outsider's perspective it's。

 all about going out and you know pimping hose but no this is really about you。

 like on a surface level it's like you going out in interaction with。

 other women you're really moving from scarcity to abundance。

 that's what it is you know and um through that you can finally know what type of。

 woman you actually like because until then you really don't know and this is。

 in my opinion why a lot of relationships fail it failed it's like you're。

 in scarcity a very few options you kind of settle she probably kind of settles too。

 uh you're not a good match there's no chemistry and of course it's going to go。

 to shit but with pickup it's like you can go out， and you're just putting yourself into so many different social interactions。

 experiencing so many different um women that you finally know like oh I have。

 a lot of chemistry with this type of girl not this one but this one and until。

 you experience it you really have no idea right now if you haven't gone。

 out much probably thinking well I like this this is my deal but that's not。

 really your ideal that's you thinking it's your ideal it's probably a。

 objection of you in a way and if you actually dated her you you know。

 go to shit so you learn it through experience you now know what you want。

 from there you're also coming from abundance you know going through the。

 process of pickup is the only way to actually experience。

 as cheesy as it sounds real love until then it's all just scarcity。

 most guys like love or even every you know kind gesture is coming from a。

 place of manipulation or bribery where right now it's like you know I really。

 like say you're in scarcity you have few options you're like I really want。

 to girlfriend if I just got a really hot girl I would do anything for her。

 but all of your actions as we've been talking about like about the being the。

 place they're coming from is scarcity you're doing it because you know you。

 need her and you'd probably do it for her or any hot girl doesn't matter once。

 you're from abundance where you have a lot of options and beyond that you've。

 discovered yourself and you realize like hey I'm， I've been complete all along you know it's not like I was peeing shit trying to。

 get there it's like I'm already there， now it's coming from a real place now if you want to like get into。

 relationship if you want to do all these kind gestures it's actually real it's。

 no longer manipulation or bribery， beyond that too what does pickup allow you to do。

 learn to one get back in touch with your emotions something society tells。

 us to just keep numbing it's like hey you're a guy repress them suppress them。

 like ignore your emotions you know it's like a sensitive guy is not a real man。

 all that shit there this will force you to get back in touch with that。

 it'll force you to start connecting with the girl too you have to develop。

 massive empathy you have to know exactly what she's feeling。

 so you guys both meet on a you know similar like a。

 a common emotional ground that you say it'll also allow you to learn to be。

 vulnerable because that's the only way too if you're not real if you're not。

 able to put that out there to put yourself on the。

 fucking line it's not gonna work you know and there's no other you know。

 there's not that many other situations in life where it's like you have to do。

 it and if you're not vulnerable it'll fuck up a lot of situations in。

 situations in life you can just like get away with it。

 now unfortunately this is one where it's like you can't cheat the system。

 and it's will really burn away all in purity you know burn away your ego it'll。

 burn away your need for validation it'll burn away that front it'll force you。

 to get back in touch with your emotions get in touch with her emotions。

 you'll learn so much about yourself and even that if you get into a。

 relationship like that'll prepare you to get in a relationship if you can't。

 be vulnerable in the initial interaction you'll never be vulnerable in the。

 relationship it won't go anywhere so you'll learn that with friendships。

 it's the same thing you know now you can actually have real friendships you。

 can learn how to vibe that that's something pick up will teach you。

 which a lot of guys have no idea just how to do it's like we're so logical。

 even getting it to pick up it's like what's the next step we don't learn how to。

 just enjoy someone just for the sake of enjoying them。

 socializing just for the sake of socializing you know。

 you'll also learn just in terms of the type of people you track now that。

 you're going places you'll track better people are also going places。

 similar mindsets to you this will apply to your job。

 you know in terms of what you think you deserve of taking risks in your job。

 jumping at opportunities it's the exact same principles。

 that in game you know I would never have jumped at different opportunities。

 like even with my job here like public speaking the first time I was gone。

 it's going on stage I was like scared shitless but through pickup。

 seen opportunities embracing that and just thriving and like enjoying like the。

 new risk or the new story that may come of it that's what allowed me to go for it。

 you know your sense of what you deserve different success barriers you have to。

 blast through just other concepts like offering value if you apply that to。

 other areas of your life like your life will explode you know friendships and。

 business if you learn offer value instead of taking value you will get far。

 okay so with this video here and again this， little story of mine just I just really want to hammer on that point where it's。

 like don't just let me yourself at success with success with women okay it's like。

 it should go way beyond that really apply this to your life if you do。

 I mean the the same success you will get with women you will get it in life。

 you know it'll be just fun effortless it'll yeah I mean I can't I can't even。

 really put in words like I would not be here without the game and if it's just。

 women you're missing out on a lot okay and guess what they go hand in hand。

 the successful woman will help your life and if you do this to your life it'll。

 also help success with women okay you can't just be someone for example who's。

 offering value only when he goes out and then you take value like 95% of the。

 time like during your day day life it's not going to work that way okay you really。

 have to embrace this way of being 24-7 this is now who you are。

 so that's law number 10 apply this to your life and brace this way of being。

 this is now you。
