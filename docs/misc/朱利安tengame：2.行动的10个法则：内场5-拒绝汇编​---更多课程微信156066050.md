我們綷keyed contractions，right rejections，big better expected always get rejected，if there 16 day chat。

다고犯了 your be fascinante，adius you would see，body meets to all，body's mean to profit。

 so it's not to happen，ac't big part of the，итit 나가s，ad，OK，那是 what fucks you up。

 it's not the fact you really get rejected， most rejections are what， nice to meet you。

 it's the label we place on it， it's like rejections horrible， all I fucked up。

 if someone told you from the beginning of time， rejections are awesome， every time you get rejected。

 you succeed in man， the game is all about rejections。

 you probably feel a little better if you got rejected， you be like fuck yeah， OK。

 so be aware of labels， OK， labels and expectations， of what fucks you up big time。

 and learn ideally， use the rejection to fuel the fun，OK， and you'll see this。

 like even when I get rejected， and sometimes when I don't even fuel the fun。

 you'll always see me like leave with a smile， as soon as you leave not smiling。

 you're coming from that taking place， OK， leave with a fucking smile， and here's some examples too。

 just make it clear too， it's not that bad， thanks for your help， thanks for your help。

 it's her or me， choose， tell her， tell her two minutes， two minutes， smile， smile，你覺得你會覺得，會在你身上。

我會在你身上，OK， if you don't go in， don't know Louisa，喂， she knows your hair， be real， smile， GO， GO。

 I'm very shy， oh no， I'm just like good mid-range， oh， I'm strong， but I can't have existed。

 like that shit， just throw me away like trash，喂， love you， no， I'm sorry。

 I just have like friends in town， I love these canned responses， like from the girl， like， oh no。

 I'm here with my friends， I'm like throw me away like dog shit， oh no。

 I'm just here with my friends， like just like， find out， I'm just wrong， OK， go， fine， just be fine。

 fine， but even then， I'm like， fine， ditch me， and immediately where does my mind go。

 I have a sore now， we have the power of the sword， oh， I have a sword now， a little lightsaber， oh。

 I have a little sword， it's like not but hurt， get better， not bitter， I'm sorry， you're real。

 this is Manlius Hanchai， Kelo， actually in there， now with this girl here。

 and this is actually a lot of rejections， and I love this example， you actually reject yourself。

 like if you look at this girl， she wants me to do well， and this is important to understand too。

 a lot of girls want you to do well， they're hoping to meet a cool guy， but who gets in your own way。

 who gets in your own way， you， and that's what I'm doing in this fucking video here。

 it's like I'm talking this girl， she's like， please be cool， and there's all this blockage。

 I'm totally in my own way， and I'm the one shooting myself in my foot， it's not even the girl。

 it's me， the little mental movies， and the shit that's in my head， they're seeing you， sorry。

 I was just saying hello， oh， shit， it's fine， like， she's like， oh， nice to meet you， I'm like。

 sorry， I was just saying hello， like， what？， I don't know， sorry， it's okay， you can say hi。

 she's like， it's okay， you can say hi， a little guy， if I'm big fun to meet like a little shi-kin。

 no， sorry， I'm just like really tired， I'm like， oh， I like that， okay， excuse me。

 I'm still second my head， I'm sorry， I'd be cool if I was， quite energetic， and not see different。

 okay， are you from Hollywood by the way or not？， um， yeah， I'm from Newport， you're from Newport。

 so the whole time， she's like， please be cool， she's giving you the chance， you just fuck it up。

 and the biggest assumption here is， I haven't made it yet， I'm not enough， I haven't hooked her yet。

 and then it's actually a lot of rejection too， I've noticed this is， guys keep acting as if。

 they have in hooked her， when they have， okay， it's like it'll go up， and again。

 your assumption's like， she's gonna reject me unless， and then you keep trying to prove yourself。

 prove yourself， prove yourself， prove yourself， and she's like， hey， I like you， you're fine。

 stop it， no， this， this， and this， acting as if you haven't hooked， it comes off as insecure。

 and it repels the girl， like all I have to do here is just relax， like， so how's it going？。

 but I'm like， fine， just do this， just do that， just do that， like with the Swedish girl too。

 she was talking to me， and if I could just relax and she'd be cool， I'd probably draw her in。

 but instead I keep trying to poke， trying to get more and more good reactions， like。

 I haven't hooked yet， a lot of interactions to realize you're there， you're good。

 take a deep breath， and start assuming， you're good enough， you're good， so hot， so hot， sorry。

 it's okay， it's nice to meet you， this is Owen， I am Katie， this one here， half-assed， I'm like。

 tap， tap， tap， it's like if you're not， believing in yourself， why would the girl believe in you。

 that too， a lot of guys， they kind of hesitant， like， excuse me， like that， no。

 that's not offering value， if you're not even convinced of your own value。

 it's like why would she be， it's okay， it's okay， it's okay， I'm very shy， don't make me。

 I didn't assume it， and something notice here too， by the way in the vibe。

 is notice how kind of rushed it is， it's kind of like， no， no， it's okay， it's okay。

 it's all based on that assumption， that I'm gonna get rejected， unless。

 it's just me trying to prove myself， me reacting to her， instead， assume you won't get rejected。

 act accordingly to that， I'm like， no， no， it's okay， she's like， what do you mean it's okay。

 I didn't reject you， no， no， no， no， don't go， I'm not even gonna go， what？， like。

 that's a lot of the interactions， I'm not， don't want to go， sit right here， sit right here。

 I'm very shy， and I never talk to women， who the fuck are you？， what's your name？， no， no， no， no。

 I don't know， I don't know， I don't know， I don't know， I'm white and on， I'm cute， I'm cute。

 I'm cute， I'm pretty bright， another thing with rejections， you will encounter elements。

 that are out of your control， sometimes for example， like if it's the first part of the night。

 all sets our rejections， they're all gonna die， eventually， it's just not time yet。

 it's not our goal， but there are also other circumstances， maybe the girls having a horrible night。

 this one here I love it， like I open this girl， and as soon as I open her。

 some dude gets punched in the throat， and falls on the floor， knocked out， and everyone's panicked。

 like if she's dead or not， and he lays her for a while， it's actually concerning。

 and then he's not dead， don't worry， but she sees that， and when that happens。

 it's not her goal to get picked up anymore， she's like wait， some guy may be dying， but yes。

 it's like what the fuck， okay， nothing I did， elements are out of your control， sometimes too。

 she'll reject you， just because her friends are there。

 some girls don't even want to seem like a sub-talking to a guy。

 or they want to look cool in front of their friends。

 and that goal is more important than meeting a new guy。

 and they'll reject you even though you're cool， okay， so accept that too。

 some elements are out of your control， stop taking everything so personally， hi， hi， I saw you。

 and how to tell you， hello， hello， hello， thank you， if your friends face just someone here。

 oh my god， oh， that just fucking happened， bang， she's like， oh my god， that just fucking happened。

 dude just got knocked out， oh my god， I just got fucking knocked out， are you Canadian？。

 are you Canadian？， are you Canadian？， there he is， and she's like， knocked out。

 like oh are you Canadian？， now in my mind， too， I'm a little， what？， do knocked out， so I'm like。

 oh Canadian， Canadian？， hold up， what do you mean you ran away？， no， are you Canadian？。

 are you Canadian？， or Canadian？， are you Canadian？， like intention here， so like， are you serious？。

 yep， are you Canadian？， just last thing，我的連ang我只能說是Canadian，可是如果我説20格，Canadian對我姆諾，可不是嗎，可能。。！，乾杯。

有酒的，是她，沒有，通常是真是，她的名字，MISS而已， information， agency，新鮮，有人說，你製作戴國歌，後面會問，何識，當 rains花的是，會當二三兩個，現時要und，冬粉。

押其使花， tu，丟，光熱，ic， OMG，最佳的，我们 cam，M spend，攀飛，哪一位，音樂，趕快回家，那你肯定拔開 My weg，S We pass，可以OFF，你得嘘，有人相活，Eкий。

自己人家都拉給你，好的，有 stirring，憑心，他不知道有什麼意義，別，懷林，生氣，NA prince，講到細胞， incidente，99。9% of the time。

 if someone gets into a fight， they weren't socially aware。

 they were all the signals and they just ignored it， or they did something stupid。

 like there was one guy I saw in Munich， it's like he's gaming this girl。

 who's sitting on her boyfriend's lap， the guy is like a huge kind of like Jack dude。

 who you can sense will get into fighting， he's like super tense， and this dude's gaming his girl。

 not just gaming her， but then he starts like biting her neck and shit。

 and then if obviously he's like just shoved off， like if you're not aware like that。

 if you do something stupid， yeah you'll get fucking in a fight， you know， it's the same as if like。

 well what if you whip your dick out in a club， you'll get kicked out。

 if you do something that's too far out there， yeah you're gonna get beat the shit out of you you know。

 so it's like still social awareness， and if the guy is like quiet and tense。

 that's when you want to bounce out too， because that's usually when the gear up to fight。

 like quiet tense like， like then that's when you get knocked out， so if you tense quiet。

 I'll have a great night， most guys ignore it， it's like ignore the A mug， ignore the A mug， bull。

 that's what happened， don't do that， what's the name of it？， the guy whatever， anyway， and the one。

 does 0。01% time it would happen？， as if you're talking to a girl， the guy's not there。

 and he runs up behind you， punches you in the back the head， that may happen， straight up。

 there's that 0。01% chance it may happen， I've done a lot of crazy shit。

 I've never been a fight personally， knock on wood， may happen tonight。

 you'll see me like in a video， like so you know， yeah， it may happen。

 but that's kind of out of your control， if that happens， and the way I view it myself is。

 say it does happen to me one day， you know if I if someone told me。

 nine and a half years ago starting out in game， it's like okay you're gonna have all these nine and a half years。

 awesome experience with women， awesome times out， here's the catch。

 you're gonna have to let some dude beat the shit out of you one time， do you want it？。

 oh yeah go ahead just beat the shout like an exchange for that。

 so the the the pros outweigh the little cons， um， and it kind of comes with the territory。

 don't think about it， just try to be socially aware enough。

 if you feel kind of tense in any situation， just bounce out。

 you know you have nothing to prove to anyone in those situations there， just like oh sorry。

 bounce out， here's another one， two guys， and a girl， the girl is actually that's her boyfriend。

 and I'm just like， hand through the two， to the girl， who the fucks this。

 I know two girls sorry they're like what the fuck dude am I， stop， come on， I saw you， I saw you。

 sorry sorry two minutes， two minutes two minutes， like two minutes two minutes two minutes to the first guy。

 two minutes two minutes two minutes to the second guy as I'm like pulling her towards me， I saw you。

 and I said hello， we all made you know， I saw you， I'm your friend， who you've known for years。

 like and then I go through my move like oh yeah tell him I'm your friend you known for years。

 this is like seriously dude， this is your man， what's the name for you， my name is。

 nice to meet you， nice to meet you， nice to meet you， he's like seriously dude like seriously。

 hey it's me， I'm not a friend， I'm like hey two minutes two minutes。

 and then I still like that line from Owens video he's like no violence， hey， be cool， no violence。

 hey I'm not real， you guys， come on， I thought he， you're fine， just be。

 but then I still make it fun， I'm like fine ditch me and then I look at him and I'm like。

 I'm strong， I can take it here， there's another awkward one。

 the girls there in the car like waiting for a friend to come out of the club， dude just runs up。

 oh hey bring it down， two seconds， two seconds wait， hang up the phone real fast。

 it's very important， hey I'm so okay， yeah it's goody， so she says some stuff。

 it sounds like Swedish， she's blonde， I assume she's Swedish， I'm like yes goody。

 I love you in Swedish， eskling， Swedish， eskling， phone down， open the door， you guys get it。

 open the door， I will， open the door， I'm very shy， why who's here， wait what's your name， Frida。

 I know I'm an asshole， I'm an asshole， don't hate， but you can speak Swedish。

 now I talked to her friend actually in the clubs， my go it's that girl。

 she's like oh you can speak Swedish， she's actually good， is your about to see。

 but I didn't have enough time to hook the driver， do you remember me， yeah I remember you。

 in the back， in the back， okay， so I'm like， awesome， but then the driver， in the back。

 do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it， trust me trust me in the back。

 in the back do it， like fuck I didn't hook the driver yet， trust me trust me。

 trust me she knows me I know her， she sounds with Frida， like they all have a friend named Frida。

 so like she sounds with Frida， she knows me， good bye， yeah come back to Gothenburg， yeah。

 ok I'm sorry， fine bye， precious， so some rejections， again not as bad as you think。

 try to always find a way to， make yourself feel good， get creative， and be aware。

 social awareness at all times，你市 einem于 priv tags。
