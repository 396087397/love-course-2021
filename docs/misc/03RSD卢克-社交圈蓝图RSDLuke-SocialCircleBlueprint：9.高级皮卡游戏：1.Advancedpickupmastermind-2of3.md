# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：9. 高级皮卡游戏：1. Advanced pickup mastermind - 2of3

我 mni，I'm a lawyer，I'm not a nurse I'm a sugar。， purely a nurse，iyở， like Klima，矜，oh my god，YAY！

 The best part， exactly， The best part is， either 1 is good，And the more you do it， doesn't matter。

 It doesn't matter if you ask the question in the statements。

 it doesn't matter if you ask the question，， you are still still going to get what your goal is， are。

 and what are your goals， the contributes， the agreement，好，笑到了，快一点，波porter 拿得时间稍微，你是做的多余的时间？。

要 Mais jam 我想请你做点再动，体验，拿个漁？？，认要的时间？，你想要骈射wwww，它对过运 constituency，到特指的 Stop，非法實測，筷子可以阿練，啟前啦 誰菲徒。

這是什麼女性 Fail，ところ結底前，裡面這個遍於，這個外婆，大家要分喝，野生 obvious，價格有很大問題， Technically it's still a qualifier。

 But it's guerrelly a level one qualifier， If berˇgiv-�� Giveo-下次 Love，迴。妳� Pros。 Is Your Name Serra？

，No， Well what is Your Name？， Summer has made famous， Restorant， Be了很多有 concern。

 Anyhow you could favorite kind，。。。。。。， 有十個納透，他有人嗎？，有今天動作的健身鏡 morning，大家看鏡底以來，因為是一種，說像光正估的，如果他HD澤。

小查份，鴛高達，和例如，有人知道前 Recently I asked Henry Cleveland，你能看見乎是嘛，如果人是特啟。，出战打法，所以ørst europi醫師，前後以前有冒険面戀種。

在世界回覦，有緣 by mastermind， ForceCentral Mmmm，他在某地在特殊，聽聞的方案，情況多少？，例如，是Sales training course。

是 really really six sales training course，Kendrick Cleveland。

Basically speech deduction is just what he learned from Kendrick Cleveland。

It's just like a small part of what Kendrick Cleveland had。

 That was a huge persuasion manipulation course basically。

 It's a really really really really good setup， But one of the key parts to it。

 If you guys heard of Frank Kern， Frank Kern is one of the biggest internet marketers in the world。

 He wrote a program called Mass Control， Mass Control is basically the top selling how to do internet marketing in the world。

 He runs huge huge it's very expensive to work with him， Very very smart guy。

 In Mass Control and in Kendrick Cleveland's program， I believe Frank Kern got it from。

 I'm a member of some of Frank Kern's like mastermind group and stuff， In some of the trainings。

 They talk about eliciting motivation， Sales and persuasion， Getting girls。

 It really comes down to it， Any sort of like convincing that you're going to do if somebody comes down to eliciting。

 It comes down to eliciting their motivation， And then creating win-win situation。

 And then closing on that situation， So eliciting motivations is critical。

 If you can elicit a girl's motivation， You can basically close her without any sort of logistical strain。

 And any sort of logistical anything no matter what the obstacles are。

 Eliciting motivations is so so huge， So when you're talking to a girl and your goal is to elicit investment out of her。

 If you can get her motivations out of her， That's going to be in the form of investment into more skin in the game。

 It's going to be in the form of investment into you or into your guys' discussion with each other。

 Does that make sense？ That kind of progression， I learned a lot about how to get investment from girls by these sales training courses。

 Because they then today all they're trying to do is。

 Is get something out of the person that's like there。

 It's kind of the same thing you're trying to do with game， I'm not exactly but kind of。

 Elicit to the girls' motivations， If you can elicit her or viewpoints or opinions or thoughts。

 And just kind of keep that her on that hamster reel。

 Telling you all this or anything you can kind of keep spitting that hamster reel。

 You're going to basically get anything you want out of that girl。

 And it's obviously up to you to take that in a healthy direction of where you want to take it。

 Thoughts on that or questions on that， It's kind of a big， I have like huge。

 huge several hour long talks about eliciting motivations just by itself。

 So basically when you're listening motivation you're being asked about。

 What she thinks about something that's the start of it。

 What she would like to know is her dreams maybe， That's a little bit further down the path， Yeah。

 basically what kind of got me honest， Is there's a way。

 way advanced ways that you can elicit motivations， But you're like you're like。

 If you and I just kept talking about this exact thing。

 Eventually you kind of keep your career smart， So eventually you kind of keep coming to the right answer。

 If we just like railed that point， It really really hard， The worst way to elicit motivations is。

 Do you like to travel？， Because yes or no， It can help you progress you down that path。

 Because listening to someone's motivations has to be like an escalator。

 Like an escalator in an airport， you know how they go several floors sometimes。

 Or like at a mall of America or the Dubai mall， Or the escalator just keep going up and up and up。

 Whereas like an elevator is a terrible way to elicit motivations。

 Because you're giving them an out at each floor， at each stop。

 When you properly listen to someone's motivations。

 They're talking for an hour and a half and they almost like， Didn't even know， Right？

 The girl almost didn't even know that the hour and a half just passed。

 Because the segue is just so naturally flowing， What do you think about listening to motivations like to figure out what they're trying to do？

， Um， the irony of like answering your question is it's going to be different each time kind of。

 So listening to their motivation， What their motivations are in a very multifaceted kind of way。

 Like the girl's motivation， So it starts with what's her motivation right now。

 In this literal present moment of her talking to me。

 Like what's her motivation on why she's at this nightclub talking to me right now doing the things she's doing。

 Most， I think it's Cindy Lopper， what's that song girls just want to have fun， Right？

 So much of game and listening to women's motivations just comes down to that。

 They like women work so hard to have no care in the world， Right？

 It's unbelievable how like irresponsible they can be， And any。

 any responsibility that a woman takes on is just to help them not be responsible。

 In some other area or later in the evening， So first。

 they listen to their motivations starts with just finding out like what's their goal right now this second？

， Is it to see Scrolex？ Right？ Is it to like have a raging night？。

 Is it to support their girlfriend who just broke up with their boyfriend and they're raged together？

， The more that you can elicit in what she's doing right now in this moment and like what her goals are for the。

 you know， what this night is going to look like to her， The more that you can solve that。

 And not necessarily solve it but that's kind of a little bit later down the stage， down the stages。

 The more you can just find out what that is and the her just qualifying herself to you and describing that to you and all those motivations to you。

 The easier it's going to be for you to actually close her or basically bridge that gap between your motivations and hers。

 Does that make sense？ Yeah， Then further on， it's her motivations in life in general and in more broad sense and more broad strokes kind of way。

 Makes sense？， Sweet， For you with the day game stuff right？。

 The listening motivations will really help with that as well because most girls in the daytime are doing something。

 So their motivation is probably not initially to hang out with you or meet some guy。

 It's not to not meet a guy but being cognizant of what her motivations are， Like you， I mean。

 Whole Foods at Town Square is a great day game spot， It's a little bit of a hike。

 it's probably a 15 minute drive， 15 minute cab ride。

 But you could do all these tables and shit you could sit out there。

 Crazy amount of girls just pop through their pop through their town square is a great day game spot as well。

 Most of the girls going there aren't going there to like see if a guy is going to hit on them。

 They're okay with it but their motivation is to shop to go see a movie at the AMC to go do this。

 go do that， So when you understand and you're very cognizant of what their motivations potentially could be。

 It's very easy to solve that motivation while you're hitting on them and achieve your motivation at the same time and bridge that gap。

 Does that make sense？， Yeah， So how would you rephrase the travel question knowing the motivation type thing？

， Where's your favorite lesson travel？， Exactly， so you're doing a technique there where you're assuming something already that she likes to travel。

 That's exactly how you want to phrase that， What if she says she doesn't。

 okay now how would you rephrase that as a statement？， You look like you've been here。

 You look like you've been here， Sure， that works， What's another way that you could phrase it？。

 You look like you've traveled， Okay， there you go， what else？。

 By the way as an exercise like when you're outside of here。

 the more of these that you just rattle off， And like let's say you have an hour of time to like practice game but like there's no women in front of you。

 The more of these you rattle off will be a lot more effective than random pause-bath formations。

 That's like one thing that you know， Instead of like talking about into the mirror of how good of a conversationalist you are。

 If you actually hone a skill of conversation like this， it will take you so far， Yeah。

 I used to do this with my buddies all the time to the point where like。

 We would try to qualify each other on which place we wanted to eat at。

 And then whoever gave in first is the loser basically， It was a lot of fun。

 we'd never like we'd spend days not eating， it was so funny， Yeah， it was a lot of fun。

 it would be super annoying for some of them too， Sweet， so I say one more time then we'll move on。

 Yeah， one more， Because the statements are always harder for guys to do。

 The statements are always a little bit harder because it takes a little just a little bit more critical thinking or outside the box thinking。

 Um。。。， No， I'm not touching another one， That's fine。

 I mean you could literally pick any place and shove it in， Yeah。

 you look like you got me in New York， New Mexico， Yeah， or like you。

 I mean you could also make it a little bit funny right。

 Like you look like you just got off of a cruise ship， Yeah。

 that's a little bit of a break and rapport with the qualified right。

 Because do you think it's a very like attractive quality， like just think just tell it like。

 Just look like you just came off of a cruise ship， It's not that attractive of a other thing right。

 Cool， what do you think？， Question and then statement， How old are you？。

 You look like you're too young to be in the club， I mean you could open some great shit， Yeah。

 that was good right？， Yeah， the ones yesterday that you were coming up with。

 When you first look at you you don't necessarily look like you're ready to jump at an answer。

 You deliver your lines， they're actually really good， Say it again so note take it up here。

 can you hear it？， Not， Did you get it or not？， No， he didn't get it， say it again。

 I want to hear it again， How old are you？， So how old are you？， That's really good。

 that's a great question， Why do you think that's such a good one？。

 You should have three five five if she's got a range， I mean if you care about those things。

 16 years ago， 16 years ago， Yeah， I guess with parent， I don't know， Yeah， he's got like the list。

 He's like and it's written out his back pocket， Yeah， How old are you？。

 There's no girl who's going to be super confident with that answer， Right？， Asking how old are you？。

 They're just going to be a little bit insecure about it， Whether they're younger or old， Almost。

 I can do a second off the time I get the question back， How old will you be when？， Yeah。

 which is good right？， Here's another trait， here's another thing。

 When a girl is doing the things to you， That you've learned is good pick up to do to them。

 That's a really good sign， If a girl is teasing you aggressively。

 That's why I think every shit test is really just a indicator of interest。

 Because if a girl gives a shit enough to throw a shit test at。

 A girl who doesn't care about you or the conversation is going to do this。

 Like she's going to leave， If a girl is throwing shit test at you。

 I look at it as just a massive indicator of interest， It's investment still into the thing。

 Same thing with questions， So if she just threw the question back out at you， That's a big。

 what that means is that she's a little bit insecure about the answer that she's going to give you。

 So she's going to play this volley back and forth of breaks from rapport with you。

 And you can go so many ways with that， And there's so many teases。

 so many funny things you can say to the question of how old you are， So now do your statement again？

， Do you look like you're too young to be in here？， What's another one？ That's great。

 You look like you're too young to be in here， You look like you're too old to be in here。

 Do you like the stereotype？， Do you like Asian？ You can say Asians look like they're nine or they're nineteen。

 You know what？ No， I do that one a lot， Asian Asians look like they're like 17 until they're like 80。

 And then when they look like， and then the second they turn 81， They look like fucking turtles。

 They're like， they're next like， sinks in pretty soon， Like when you take care of me in our old age。

 You're going to be like that turtle that's helping me around。

 I'm going to be like this old super wrinkly， bad-tanned white， old white man。

 And you're going to be this turtle walking around my fucking thing。

 You're going to look like you're 140 when you're 80， When you're 81。

 When you're 80 you look like you're 17， And we all know that's a kind of girl I like anyway， Right？

 The 17 year old raw Asian girl is like， it's basically， I'm not even going to call you Susie。

 You're basically， she's me at that point， Right？ Like the more you can play that， Right？ The like。

 and draw it out， The even more effective it's going to be。

 Because she's going to laugh at each thing， So it's not like you're just like throwing the joke at her the first time。

 You're throwing the breaker poor， then you're getting the qualifier out of her， Right？

 Like the qualifying question， the qualifying content out of her。

 And then you're going to throw another breaker poor at her。

 And you're just going to kind of keep this cycle going。

 And that's where you get all of the huge bit of investment， Cool， give her a couple more。

 Throw it out the same thread， Yeah， same thread because you don't want to steal theirs。

 You can say you look like your tool that will still be coming to clubs if she's a little bit older。

 Yeah， harsh， I like it， Yeah， that's a little bit of a good though， Harsh isn't bad， You can say。

 I understand a lot of these qualifying statements are a bit of a breaker poor and qualifier at the same time。

 And then it's the content that she gives you back that you're looking for， What else？。

 You look like there's got a lot of money on the fake ID， It's good， It's really good。

 Now give a couple more because you're really good at this。

 So when else can we get this brain dumb going， I don't think it would like harsh ones right？。

 That's fine， This is the environment， do the harsh ones。

 You look like you're trying really hard to hide your age with all that makeup， That's funny。

 I mean like arguably based on the situation， that's not necessarily too harsh。

 Some girls are going to find that too harsh and some girls are going to eat it up。

 That would be really good if she really wasn't wearing that much makeup。

 Because then it's now not too harsh， That's really harsh if she is wearing a lot of makeup。

 And she's like maybe 36， I think in Miami I had the set of the girls。

 In Miami I had the set of the girls and I tried zero line， You are so wrinkled with my right hand。

 And she was looking back at me， she had no wrinkles， Yeah， yeah， She was laughing so much， Yeah。

 nice dude， Nice people in the organization， Yeah， What did I say？， Yeah， my summer talk， I'm like。

 Say the girls face， they just got such bad wrinkles， They look so bad right in that sack。

 And she's like， She's like this right？， She's like this right？， She's like this right？， Yeah， yeah。

 she's going to give you this confused facial paralyzed look。

 And then she's going to laugh her ass off， it's so funny， But again。

 if it's a woman who's 31 or older， it might not work out so well。

 I started saying that to these LA club hosts， There's like all these Swedish girls that go out to the LA nightclub。

 and I started saying on them， First I said it was on a girl named Lynn。

 And I said it on her and she just like wouldn't stop laughing。

 She'd talked about it for like years later， Like if I see her again， she'll be like。

 Remember the ball sack thing that you said to me？， It's like so funny， Problem is now like。

 Swedes smoke so much， like these girls， That now she probably does look like my right hand。

 And I'm moisturized it， So who knows， like it caught up， Kidding， cool， good ones， good ones。

 Any harcer one？， That part talks about sobriety， That part talks about sobriety， Nice。

 any Botox comment？ Yeah， Because that's a bit with the age， right？， Cool， cool， the next one。

 go for it， Qualified question？ Yeah， yeah， yeah， go for it， Qualified question and statement。

 So are you adventurous？， Are you adventurous？ That's like the PUA qualifier from 20 years ago。

 right？， Are you adventurous？ Okay， what else？， So statement can be， yeah， you look adventurous。

 Sure， that's an easy one， right？， So how can you turn the。

 are you adventurous to be a little bit better？， Okay， so yesterday I told you to do something。

 You'll be talking crazy or something crazy about ice， So I'm going to use company， Sure， yeah， yeah。

 what else？， How adventurous are you？， Kind of assuming that they're already adventurous。

 And she's like， oh， not that adventurous or she's， you know， Oh， I'm super adventurous。

 you qualify her further and further down that path， Right？

 So assuming I have to how to create from how adventures you are， Yeah。

 so like instead of saying like， are you adventurous？， Okay。

 You could just do the assumption thing like I was talking about this guy， Right， and you go。

 how adventurous are you？， Right， I love adventure， like that's one of those， Okay。

 so anytime the qualifier is like this really wide hoop， that's for them to jump through。

 I always like starting with the qualifier， Because if you're just like， how adventurous are you？。

 Or are you adventurous？， But who knows where they can take that adventure word， It could be sexual。

 it could be like athleticism， it could be emotional， Like who knows where they can take that word？。

 Like you get weird answers to that， Or instead if you're like， you know what？， No， no， no， no。

 you look adventurous， Like if you like accuse them of being adventurous， then it like。

 The doors open a little bit more， Right？， Cool， good job， go for it。

 So how much money did you really spend on your hair？， Nice， how much money I like the word really？。

 It's kind of like saying actually， Right， how much money did you really spend on your hair？， Right。

 that's good， As a statement， your hair looks like you just do what cost of all this amount， Yeah。

 Man， hair is such a big part of my game， Can't wait till I grow it back out to the length I used to have it。

 I had it almost his length a few years ago， It was， I mean， it's like the best fucking prop ever。

 It's so awesome， I don't know if you had to use it for game at all or， Yeah， it works so well。

 There's so many things dude， With the hair thing， I love the whole extension route， The weave route。

 Check your nails and pat your weave dances， So awesome。

 You basically tell a girl like the girl that you're talking to。

 So one of my big game tactics is I just， In my conversation with the girl I'm talking to。

 I'll just judge all the other girls in the club， Like harshly， Like， oh my god， look at this chick。

 Her weave is falling out， She needs to do the weave dance， Girl， what's the weave dance？， You go。

 you know， when you pat your weave and check your nails， Right？， Because like you look around。

 there's always like a group of heavy set black girls， Patting their weave like this。

 And then like as they're dancing， they're just patting their weave。

 And then they're gonna look at their nails at the same time， What was the weave？。

 Weave is like fake hair， It's literally the hair that half the girls you hit on， half， Yeah。

 extensions weave， clip in the glue， whatever it might be， Like none of these。

 like any girl with really awesome hair， 98% chance that it's a weave， Or it's not her real hair。

 It's like some Indians hair that she bought for like several hundred dollars， Minimum， Right。

 So I mean like I love like， If I don't compliment her girls， like。

 My little routine stack that's like most of the sets I do right now。

 Because I'll compliment her hair， She'll go， oh my god， thank you， And I go， no really。

 it looks real， And then like I'll grab behind her head。

 And like I'll touch where the glue would be or the clip， The clips would be。

 And then it's like I'm grabbing the hair， It's like， no， it's like， It's adjusted pretty well。

 Actually， it's nice， And oh my god， how do you know？， Or oh my god， they are extensions， Oh my god。

 Jackie， he found out I have extensions， And then just like， Progress is the conversation。

 It's like ten second conversation， It just progresses it to like minute five， Which works really。

 really well， I'm like， oh， you can't even tell us horse hair， It's not horse hair。

 it's real human hair， Because that's like the big， it's like the big thing with like weave hair。

 Is if it's like horse hair or if it's actually like real human hair， So if you like， that like。

 it's big， It's a big problem in like the extension industry， Right？。

 So if you kind of put it on the spot with that， She's like， fight back with you about it， Got one？。

 Where's your favorite color in Vegas？， You know what I'm actually calling five and five？。

 There you go， Hey， or like， If you could tell the girls have been going to Vegas a lot。

 Talk about like Jet Night Club or what oak， Right？， Is that a ratchetist？， The LA。

 actually probably the ratchetist， Can you say yours again？， What's the problem with these？， Yes。

 so he can write the note， Yeah， We're all sleeping inside of what's your favorite color in Vegas。

 And you're like a ratcheter， like a front and a fight， How does it look like when I'm running？。

 I use that a lot， I'm sure I'll use it a lot， The whole ratchet thing is fantastic， Because let me。

 I like to give you guys like anecdotes of examples。

 Because you can like take it more fit and apply it to your own game， Right？。

 And like the stuff that I gave you， right？， The stuff that I talked about at Summit。

 I remember you were kind of vocal in the front， right？。

 The stuff that I tell you guys in this setting， If it's like 6 a。m。 and we're in Rhino together。

 Oh my god， heaven's like， can't believe I just said that， If we're in Sapphire together， right？。

 We're in the other strip club， And it's like 6 a。m。

 I'm just gonna tell you some shit that like may or may not work， It's gonna be funny and fun。

 You're gonna see me like fuck up and like do some shot。

 Like you're gonna see me like go crazy and it may or may not work， If we're in this setting。

 the stuff I'm giving you， Will just work like 95% of the time。

 Like it's just good shit that's always gonna work， Because I want you to be able to take it。

 apply it， Just more fit into like your own style， And then go off and use it and increase your odds。

 I want you all to be able to have more options， And we'll be able to hook up with two girls a week if you want to do three girls a week。

 And then work on yourself develop， Because you're just like self development， I don't not like it。

 it's just a long term， It takes so long， you can't just in one week to two weeks。

 You can't just like feel amazed about yourself forever every day all the time。

 You can't get abs in two weeks， You can get laid once or twice a week forever in a couple week type of thing。

 Just using the techniques， Sometimes we'll at least get confidence in that area and then fix it and go forward。

 So the ratchet one， I want to come back to that a little bit， it's amazing， Why？

 Because I like girls so I identify themselves with being ratchet。

 But also know that they're kind of kidding when they talk about it。

 Like I like girls who dance to ratchet music in a ratchet way。

 But then like are kind of smirking as they're doing it。

 Like they're making fun of the idea of being ratchet as they're dancing ratchet。

 Does that make sense？， Not truly ratchet， So it's an example though of a thing。

 so ratchet would be a little bit hood， a little bit ghetto， A little bit of a little oak cliff。

 This is where all the Dallas people go by their crack， That's when you said the type of weave。

 I see that so much back home， Yeah， but the funny thing is I dated this girl。

 And she's this beautiful thin blonde girl， That's a very typical Dallas really pretty blonde girl and she had a weave。

 And all of her girlfriends had weaves， But like weave is a term that usually like black or Hispanic girls call it。

 So when every time I call it a weave， she'd be like what the fuck？， It's not a weave。

 it's extensions， Exactly the same thing， No difference。

 But by playing on the racial stereotype a little bit， like I'm not racial。

 Like she's one of the few white girls that are dated， come on， But like by me playing off of it。

 it made her feel more insecure about it， And it's insecure in a fun playful way。

 I'm not trying to like make her suicidal insecure。

 I'm trying to make her feel like I want to make her second guess herself， Is really what it is。

 right？， And more you can make her second guess herself， the better it's gonna go。

 The ratchet one works phenomenal because it's something that I actually like in a girl。

 But I'm still qualifying her on the ratchetness， Right。

 it's kind of like me telling a girl who's got an amazing ass。

 Like how it's just not a big enough ass， What do you think a girl with an amazing ass is gonna do？。

 Who knows it？， She's gonna stick it out， she's gonna be like what do you mean it's not amazing？。

 It's not good enough for you， huh？， It's not good enough for you， then you can't touch it。

 Like she's gonna put it back a little bit harder， Does that make sense？， Cool。

 So think about some traits that you guys want， which is kind of the next exercise after this。

 So really good one， I like the ratchet one， Give me another qualifying statement about it， Okay。

 that's great， right？， That's great because like most girls will kind of think that this club isn't their type of club。

 There's a great podcast that you guys ever listen to podcasts。

 I listen to like two to four hours of podcasts a day， I'm addicted to them， You know Tim Ferris。

 the four-hour week， he's got a great podcast， He's kind of a shitty interviewer。

 but I love to everything by Tim Ferris， And his podcast he got as a podcast， he did with Cascade。

 The music， the one of the biggest DJs in the world。

 Where he just basically interviews Cascade about his， like how he came up with music。

 Super good podcast， There's an interesting， there's a bunch of interesting game tidbits in there。

 But what made me think of it as the whole， like this doesn't seem like your type of club。

 I run out of like most girls won't think that this current club that they're in is their type of club。

 Right， they're going to have some judgment or hate to say， some hate or hate that they drink about。

 Whatever a club that they happen to be in， So that's why it's great because it's so applicable。

 Right， that's the best type of cold read， Right， cold read。

 a cold read is basically something that's applicable to most of the girls that you're talking about。

 And you just happen to say the statement， It's really， really， really solid outer game tactic， Okay。

 yeah one more， Because it's a great， it's a phenomenal one that you're going with so it's good。

 Yeah， For our life， it's probably normal， Yeah， Qualify them about certain value aspects， Right。

 so instead of you having to brag about your value， qualify them about theirs。

 So you can qualify them， notice a lot of these qualifying statements are breaks and rapport， Okay。

 it's a really， really good tool to kind of combine。

 Do you like watching it and you got to be able to accept that？， Yeah， I mean， you could。

 you could say， say there's a statement， Should you be able to be able to be able to accept that？。

 Yeah， that's kind of doing his auntie a little bit though， Yeah， yeah， you， how about like。。。。

 I didn't think the idea was appropriate for you anyway， some of my friends， Yeah， harsh， yeah。

 How about， how about this？， Didn't I see you at Table 43？， If you clearly didn't see it at Table。

 when she was a girl at the bar or she was just a girl walking， Or like， ask her， like， aren't。。。。

 Are you。。。。
