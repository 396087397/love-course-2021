# 泰勒基础与高级游戏RSD：正宗社交力学 DVD 2

 men tend to unconsoudly divided men into two cagories，presenter guy，motor guy who。

can take care of her，and got take around on three months of dаты，以前被追訪者當習慣的喜好女的朋友，那個小朋友，不開除的，所以。

我覺得lanemia的反酷，的案件，小朋友開始俱暖，他又進居家，所以他教藉你， house 她是她是個樣子，跟風話，然後她說，您敷衛，真正說，Ok great，y nation，然後。

然後您被被它的返到，在，你抱致細善，都開了，這樣， MORTE，了，所以她 Пред Bunun，她不想被她打扮，她不敢被她打扮，所以你不敢被她打扮，所以我們會談到的，我們會再談到的，但我認為很多人。

要承認自己的朋友，如果他們喜歡她，他們覺得我真的喜歡這個朋友，我需要承認自己的朋友，但我們會讓她的朋友，讓她的朋友，讓她的朋友，讓她的朋友， Wenn你走開，進行民謊，能把我們進行imento。

 from open to close，在都吃不吃，你愛追求，その這種時光，讓 персонажling，想愛喜歡好的寶 Yell，這種泥氣，妳真的愛妳，那您指揮了那個，給她才是 doorway。

所以您 can you，那您能指揮了，能从终于开始， barn house to have a good mining， bore， play match。

 make her feel good about what she is working on， immediate， grow who you really like， process。

 for her， process that you build， successfully，那 same process that you built is the process that you built for her。

 So that when you meet the girl that you want， it's automatic。

 I'm in a relationship right now about just about two years， And the way that I met my girlfriend。

 who I really really liked， even from the moment I met her， was just doing the exact same things。

 that I'd done countless times before， And it was completely automatic。

 Even though I really liked her， I had no fear of walking away。

 It would not have bothered me to walk away， I remember I had her on the couch and I was pushing her off the couch。

 And she'd come back on， I pushed her off the couch， she'd come back on。

 And I put right up to the point where she's almost like so frustrated with me。

 that she's ready to walk， But because I didn't even flinch and I'm just having fun。

 I'm just having a good time， She stayed， But at no point was I not willing to walk away， In fact。

 even in our relationship right now， Because I have that firm boundary of what behavior I do and do not accept。

 If she crossed over that boundary in an unreasonable way， And we discussed it。

 And we couldn't clarify it， I would walk away， And she understands that， And she respects me for it。

 And she has a similar boundary in her mind too， which is why I respect her。

 So that same process that you build， You know， learning how to create that fun time with the girl。

 Wind up， you know， in bed together quickly， Is this exact same process that you'll use when you want to meet the girlfriend who you want。

 And you know， you wind up hooking up， And then you wind up just continuing to see each other after and developing into a relationship。

 So trust the process， When you meet a lot of the time when you meet a girl you really like what you'll do。

 You go to your friends， you'll say I really like this girl， I want to play this solid。

 You'll start acting differently， you're talking to your friends about it。

 And you're getting inside your head， you're getting stuck inside your head。

 You're thinking about it too much， you're becoming reactive when you see or you're feeling nervous。

 It should never ever be like that， When you see the girl who you really like you should just be having a good time。

 They say they call that you know， being yourself， You know。

 we could really get into what being yourself means。

 But what that really means is just having a good time with her and doing what you want to do。

 And giving her the opportunity to see what you're about， I think when girls say be yourself。

 What that really means is just to bring her into your world。

 Show her what you're about and let her make up her own mind。

 Instead of trying to persuade her and convince her and try and manipulate her to like you。

 Just pull her into your world， But for a lot of guys it's very hard because that's easier said than done。

 To truly pull her into your world from like you know， in an authentic place。

 Or you're just being real， that's hard to do because you've got all these different emotional forces。

 Social pressures， trying to make you act in different ways to get the outcome that you want。

 But you have to let go of the outcome， So decide right now that you're not going to be that guy who courts women for months and months and months。

 You're going to be the fun guy who you know， you can just go out， You can meet women easily。

 you meet women all the time， It's not a big deal to you， you're not judgmental about it， You know。

 it's just it's a fun way to you know， to release intention， You know， to you know。

 to really cement a moment， That's what sex is about for you， It's not some huge big deal for you。

 It's not a big deal for her， you can make it happen， It's fine， guys。

 if you can get yourself into that position， You'll have the girlfriend you want very quickly。

 You'll have choice， you'll be a better boyfriend for her， You won't be needy。

 you won't be jealous or insecure， You can build that， so make that your goal。

 Always trust the process， you built it for her， Nerd thinking。

 how do a lot of nerds think about this？， I can learn the magic lines to get women。

 jump out of the shadows， Get one and take her back to my nerd layer， I mean， you know。

 a lot of guys that are kind of internet savvy， You know， they like to stay at home， maybe they。

 you know， they play some， you know， everquests， online games， whatever。

 They don't like to go out too much， And they think of this as like learning a power。

 They can learn some kind of power， A lot of guys who learn this stuff， You know。

 they have issues with women that they're not past yet， You know。

 and they think that they can learn this again some kind of power， It's not really about that。

 Learning how to be good with girls is about becoming a better person， Learning better social skills。

 more confidence， Learning about female psych， that kind of thing， It takes time， Nerd thinking。

 I want to match a pill， Fix me， fix me， That's the， that's got to be the worst kind of thinking。

 A failures that I can think of， When I was learning how to be good with women。

 I learned from a variety of different sources， Never once did I view those sources as being responsible for fixing me。

 I never ever viewed it like that， I viewed them as a resource， When someone is helping me。

 there are resource， It's up to me to get out of it what I'm going to get out of it。

 Nobody can fix you but yourself， You have ultimate responsibility to fix your own problems。

 No one's going to fix it for you， You can come to a program like this， leave unfixed。

 And go around for next 30 years and say it's not my fault。

 I paid a guy to fix me and it didn't work， it's not my fault， But you will just wind up lonely。

 You'll spend your whole life lonely， You'll have your story。

 but you'll spend your whole life lonely， It's ultimately up to you to take complete and total responsibility。

 For getting this area of your life handled， Because it's your life。

 It is your life and nobody else's， And it's your life to enjoy， So if this is something you want。

 anybody who's in this room must clearly want this， It's up to you to go out and get it， Okay。

 here's the other big one， I've never accomplished anything in my life， I don't like myself。

 And yet I can't understand why I'm not good at this， In my opinion。

 probably one of the number one reasons， Why guys fail at this。

 Is because they have a pattern of failure throughout their life。

 If you've never accomplished something that took a year to just you know， chipping away at it。

 What leads you to believe that you're going to get this down。

 You probably would have no reason to believe that。

 You must cultivate the skills to learn new things， Sticking to something， Having a plan。

 a plan of action， and sticking to it， Go progressively chipping away at it。

 Not being deterred when you hit a plateau， That kind of thing， Being willing to test yourself。

 Most guys live life in reaction， They run away from tests。

 They don't want to live in any kind of pressure， They just want to live in their comfort zone， Well。

 this is not something that's about being in your comfort zone。

 You will have to push outside your comfort zone， The more that you can do that。

 the more success that you're going to have， But if you can't， it's not going to matter。

 Anybody who would make the decision right now， To just go out regularly and work on this stuff。

 We'll get it， Even if they probably didn't， you know， just from what we've talked about。

 Just in this first hour， If someone were to just hear this first hour。

 And go out for a period of time and just chip away at it， They would get it。

 It might take a little bit longer， but they would eventually get it。

 If you guys aren't willing to make that commitment， You probably are not going to get it， Again。

 it comes down to balancing your life， You know， balancing it out。

 Finding time in your life to make this happen， But you must do that。

 You must have those kind of processes built into you。

 The same process is that you learn to be successful in any endeavor。

 Are the processes that you're going to be used to be successful in this。

 And that needs sticking to it， Cool guy thinking， I will build confidence and social skills over a period of time。

 It takes time， I will be a naturally attractive guy， What do I mean by that？。

 A lot of guys are folks on， you know， I learn the routines， the lines。

 I don't have to change who I am， I can just cover up who I am。

 And therefore I will have a woman and I will fix my problem， I will fulfill my void。

 A lot of guys are walking around with an internal void。

 But they want a woman to come in and fill up for them， It's not going to work。

 A strong way of thinking is you're going to become a better person。

 You're going to use this process to become a better person， Better social skills， more confidence。

 more belief in who you are， And build that， That is strong thinking。

 Become a better person from inside now， You'll step out of your comfort zone， And ultimately。

 you view it as fun， This is a fun thing， it's cool， The reason that I talk about， you know。

 stepping outside your comfort zone， Obviously if you're going out to a nightclub by yourself。

 Those first few approaches that you do， you know， they're a little bit nerve-wracking。

 And obviously， you know， you have to have that， I'm going to step outside my comfort zone mentality。

 But for the most part， you guys have to realize that this is fun， In fact。

 I think that for a lot of guys， this is probably the most fun thing to do， Because it is really。

 really fun， You can take a guy who's in the same rut of， you know， same job， same boss。

 Same lifestyle， doesn't travel， And he starts doing this and every night becomes a new adventure。

 When you go out， when you go out to meet women， You have no idea what could happen at the end of that night。

 There is no way that you know， I've gone out and had a terrible night。

 Just really poor night very inside my head， Lacking confidence that night。

 And I did one last approach， And that girl becomes my girlfriend for， you know。

 a couple months after that， Just from that one last approach and I had no idea what adventure。

 you know， my night was going to result in， You guys never know that you're sitting at home watching TV and you go。

 you know what？ I'm just going to go out， And you go out and you don't know。

 like you never know what could happen， You think about it， you talk to one girl， okay。

 my current girlfriend right now， I met her outside of a bar about three o'clock in the morning in Los Angeles at her most of each。

 As she was piling out of a bar， I just pulled her aside， Like that。

 I talked to her for about five minutes， She was Mexican。

 so I made fun of her having tacos in her first thing， I could smell tacos and say。

 I want to see her first， And she gave me her number within about five minutes。

 She didn't even remember me when I called her， But she chatted with her on the phone。

 got her laughing， She eventually remembered who I was and look what happened。

 I embarked on a long relationship， very healthy relationship where we both really grown。

 So you don't know， what if I had gone home five minutes earlier。

 My life would be different right now， And see， you guys don't know that。

 You have to realize that any time that you go out is a new adventure waiting for you。

 It might be just a nightmare， you just get pounded， It's just a rough night。

 but that will thicken your skin， And make you progressively desensitize suit to the point where you're less。

 who cares， Because every time that you go out and you wake up the next day and everything's fine。

 Your subconscious mind says， whatever， no big deal， it's fine。

 And then you become more confident and you build that confidence that eventually gets you the girl you want。

 So just remember it's fun， Here's how you're going to get good with girls， here's how it'll be done。

 You're going to commit to going out a certain number of nights per week。

 I don't care if it's two or seven， They're both fine， Whatever you want， whatever works for you。

 But whatever it is， you're going to do it proactively， not reactively。

 Which means that you're going to make a decision beforehand， not based on emotions。

 Or if you're tired or if you're lazy， you're going to make a decision beforehand。

 Of how much you're going to go out， From there， and this is to force yourself。

 you're going to make a decision， As a newbie， you're going to make a decision of how many girls you're going to approach that night。

 And you know what？ It could be three， it could be ten， Whatever it is， you're going to stick to it。

 You have to do that， My recommendation， I like Thursday， Friday， Saturday， if you can。

 Try to approach， if you're new and your interactions will last so long。

 Try to approach ten women a night， Go for it， See how it works out， make a choice， If you have to。

 put on a stopwatch， Do whatever you look， here's what comes down to。

 Some of you guys here will have no problem with this， And you say， okay。

 I'm going to go on an approach of women and it's no problem。

 You don't even need to put the number of times per week， it's fine。

 Some of you guys will be good at this so quickly， just unbelievable， But for those of you guys。

 which is probably the majority of people who will not do that， who will go to the club。

 And I'm going to go check out the club， man， I'm going to go to the bathroom。

 I'm going to go get a drink at the bar， I'm going to see if any hot girls are here。

 I'm going to go see if I have any friends here， And you're stalling and you're stalling。

 And you're getting more inside your head， you're slowing yourself down。

 You're just wrecking it for yourself， Which is the majority of what the majority of guys are doing。

 You guys have to put those lines in the sand， You have to make the choice。

 I'm going to Thursday Friday Saturday this week or whatever days you want。

 I'm going to approach 10 women， one every 15 minutes for 2。5 hours， Whatever it is。

 if my interaction lasts longer than 15 minutes， I can reduce that number by 1， Whatever it is。

 that's fine， Remember， a lot of guys focus on the more approaches they do the better。

 What's the ideal number of approaches to doing a night？， Ideally， 1， this goes all the way。

 That's the ideal number， so don't get caught up in big numbers means more。

 But you've got to make that decision to make this a part of your life。

 This is no different than lifting weights， It's the exact same thing。

 You make the decision on which days you go， which exercise you're doing， You do it in advance。

 And just like lifting weights you will build social strength and internal strength。

 The first thing that will happen， this will go in sort of like。

 It's kind of this funny progression that you'll find。

 The first thing that you'll do is you'll just learn how to open conversations。

 So probably you'll walk around the club， kind of nervous， kind of inside your head。

 And just get used to approaching people， And that can take time， But you will get it。

 You guys remember when you're a kid and you go to a diving board。

 You jump off and the first one's a tough one and then you just do it。

 You do it and you do it and you do it and it just becomes natural， So that's what's going to happen。

 You guys are just going to get used to initiating a conversation， As you build confidence。

 people will be more and more receptive to you， Because when you go in nervous， they shut down。

 Of course， the fact that you know that can sometimes be a self-fulfilling prophecy。

 Because you think yourself， I'm nervous， they're not going to be nice。

 Which makes you more nervous and becomes self-fulfilling prophecy， So don't think like that。

 You have to make the choice you're going to go in nervous or not， But the point is。

 go in and get used to that， The next thing that will happen is you learn how to get a conversation going。

 A lot of guys call that， you know， I ran out of stuff to say syndrome， What do I say？。

 What's my lines？ I don't know what to say next， I can't keep it going。

 It's like learning how to surf， You just learn it first， how to just get up on the board。

 And then at first you just learn how to sail on the board， And you just fall right off。

 And you just keep doing that， keep doing that until you can just get a few feet。

 So eventually you learn how to keep a conversation going for five minutes， Wow， you know。

 a five minute conversation， And usually you'll feel like you're walking on clouds after that。

 You feel like the man， Because hey， how many of your friends do you know。

 Who can walk up to strangers and get a five minute conversation going？。

 You probably have a lot of cool friends， but most of them cannot do that with strangers。

 Maybe a couple of candidates are probably the ones that are really cool， But for the most part。

 they can't， So you guys will build that skill set。

 Eventually you'll learn how to ask for phone number， This is what will generally happen to you。

 You'll do what I just described for a period of time。

 And some of the girls got for bid will actually like you， But of course。

 will you ask for the number？， No， And you know why you won't？。

 Because you feel validation from the girl liking you， And you don't want to wreck it。

 That's why you'll do that， It's very， very calm， it's extremely calm， It's fine。

 it's not a big deal， but you got to push past it， So eventually what will happen is you'll ask for a phone number。

 And you'll be amazed that you will get it， And you will get it， And you'll think， Oh my god。

 I just got this phone number， Think of all those other girls whose numbers I could have gotten。

 And you'll go on a tear， You will go on a tear， You will get like ten phone numbers in a night。

 And you will go home and you will look at them， And you're like， look at this。

 I have ten phone numbers， I am the man， And then what will happen is you'll call those numbers。

 And what will happen is the girls will act like they don't know you， They will forget who you are。

 They'll say they're busy， They'll say， oh， let me call you back in a second。

 They won't call you back， And you will be flaked， And this will happen， It's gonna happen。

 And then your high goes away， You don't feel warm and fuzzy anymore。

 The reason for that is because women will give their phone number to just about anybody。

 It's just a phone number， Look， you could probably walk up to a woman， Say， too funny things， Say。

 you know what， I've got to get out of here， I'm dying to call you， Just give me your number。

 She'll go， sure， whatever， Doesn't mean she's going out with you， Doesn't mean anything。

 It just means that she's willing to talk to you a little bit more。

 That's all it means if a woman gives you your phone number， That's fine though。

 So what will happen is you'll see that happen， You'll see that。

 And you'll sort of go back to the drawing board， You know， you'll go back。

 You'll look at what you did right and wrong， And the better that you get with women。

 The more that you improve， The more that you're that that kind of the flaking。

 And the girls sort of blowing up will go down， So at first you'll get like one out of every 10 girls。

 Might be willing to meet up with you again， Then you know two out of 10。

 And then eventually you'll get to a point where over half the girls who you call。

 Will want to meet up with you， And it's really cool， So or they'll even start calling you， Wow。

 right？， That can even happen， So it's something that you'll progress。

 Then what will happen is you'll learn how to get what's called the day two。

 We don't call them dates because that's a dating frame， We call it a day two。

 You just go hang out somewhere fun， You just have a really fun time together。

 But what will probably happen to you， Is you'll get your first day two。

 From a girl who you who you cold approach， You get a cold approach on a girl， You chatted with her。

 You got her number， You talked her on the phone， It went okay， Now you got your day two。

 And you'll probably clean your house up， And you'll plan it。

 And you'll be like all I've tied about it， And nervous about it and excited about it all simultaneously。

 And you'll get there and you'll be very nervous， And you'll blow it， And that'll happen as well。

 And then you'll go back to the drawing board again。

 And you'll start getting more and more phone numbers。

 And you'll start getting more and more day two， It'll just keep hot and you'll just keep getting through it。

 Until now you actually are comfortable on a day two， Now you start bringing the girl home。

 But when you get her back to your house， You're like， is this it？， Will I finally end my loneliness？

， And of course you won't， Because you're blown there， And you'll think about it。

 And you go back to the drawing board， And you'll become confident with it。

 Because really what this is， It's not even so much about learning the skills。

 Although there are skills， It's really just learning to be comfortable with it， That's it。

 It's learning to be comfortable with a stranger， In a new situation that you're not familiar with。

 You're familiarizing yourself with these situations， And the point where， where is before。

 You learn how to open any woman， Open any conversation， And make it last for five minutes。

 In the same way that you can consistently open a conversation， And make it last for five minutes。

 You'll learn to go through all the processes， And you'll learn to consistently go from all the way from meat。

 All the way to sex， And you'll be able to do it consistently。

 Any time with the exact same consistency， Of just being able to open a conversation。

 But that takes time。 It means you have to go through the process。

 Means you have to focus on it for a bit， You know， work on and ship away， And this is really fun。

 This is the kind of thing that's just， It's a huge confidence builder， Because if you can do this。

 Man， it's almost like you do anything， And when you have those kind of options。

 Where you know that you can meet a new girl any time， Like， I remember the first。。。。

 I remember once when I really realized， You know， I had a lot of realizations on my path。

 And I remember being in Dallas， At a stopover， And the flight attendant said， Yeah。

 we're having a stopover in Dallas， And I went， wow， you know， I've never been in Dallas。

 I could get out by myself， I could go out， you know， find the nightlife。

 And I could have some crazy adventure， And probably need some new girl。

 And keep in touch and everything， And I realized I could do that at any point， And to me。

 that's just a fun thing， You know， I can travel anywhere， I can meet new people。

 If I'm in the airport in a shopping mall and I'm bored， Like， I could just be walking along。

 Just bored out of my mind， And just create all this fun energy around me。

 And just create this whole dramatic incident， At any point， You know。

 if there's someone I want to meet， Some girl I want to talk to， I can go and do that。

 Because I've gone through this process， I never have to feel like if my girlfriend were to break up with me。

 That I'd be stuck or without options， So I've got this great situation， Where， you know。

 that sort of dark cloud of neediness， And insecurity that was hanging over my life is gone now。

 And I've just got this situation of choice， You know， I can be in the relationships I want to be in。

 You know， I can， you know， I can have the kind of fun that I want to have。

 And that's really what I'm trying to teach you guys here。

 So that's the process that you're going to go through。

 That comes down to putting the lines in the sand， And making the decisions of what you're going to do。

 And how you're going to do it， And sticking to it no matter what， While you're doing this。

 Things are going to improve， You guys have all seen naturals， You guys have watched them。

 You've seen guys that are good with women without realizing it， But unconsciously you realize it。

 As you go out more and more， Your mind says you can be like that now。

 You start to identify yourself as one of those guys， And you take on those behaviors。

 As you go out more and more， Your humor， your storytelling skills， your confidence， your charisma。

 These things are going to improve， They're going to go up and up and up。

 And it's just going to make this amazing personality shift for you。

 These things will handle themselves， Everything that you guys want to know， What should I say next？。

 You know， how do I be funny？， Any of that stuff will handle itself。

 And you can keep chipping away at it， Now what we're going to do is。

 I'm going to explain kind of what the root of the seminar will be。

 You never want to be out and have an excuse， Not to approach a girl who you want to approach。

 You never want to be out， And see a girl that you want to talk to， And say to yourself。

 I don't know what to say， You never want that to be an excuse。

 You never want to be talking to a girl for half an hour or an hour。

 And maybe want to take her to a restaurant or something like that， And say， well。

 I don't know how to do that， So I don't have an excuse， you know。

 so you have the excuse not to do it， So as a newbie， especially a self-taught newbie。

 What you really want is some default way， To open the conversation。

 Some default way to hook her attention， Like to make herself stand out from other guys quickly。

 Some kind of default way to get a little bit of touch going， Like what we were talking to you about。

 How if you could have gotten the touch going early， You know。

 you could have broken through that barrier， And make it comfortable for her。

 You want to have some kind of way to create， you know，， Get some good story-sharing going。

 create a great vibe， You want a great way to ask for a number。

 So you always know exactly how to ask for a number， And you want a great way to move venues。

 Whether it's to a restaurant or your house， even to your room， wherever it is。

 These ways can be simple or complex， Don't buy the idea they have to be complex。

 They can be very simple， What's the way to start a conversation， for example？， Like。

 why don't we just go like the simplest ways we've talked about， Ways to start a conversation。

 what are you drinking？， That's it， last night I talked to a girl， What are you drinking？， She said。

 I'm drinking wine， I said， you know， I had to make fun， I was like， ooh， to cover your。。。。

 To cover your。。。， She said， no， it's a pinot， I said， oh， I've got that。

 But my mom told me not to talk about it， I'm in， right？， Quick conversation， I'm in there， okay？。

 Open a conversation， It could be something very simple， Even just going， introducing yourself。

 The stuff can work， How to make yourself stand out from other guys。

 Quickly make an observation of her， Get her laughing， You know， how to get touch going。

 Do a high five， random high five， It's funny， Boom， you got it， handshake， whatever。

 How to get a vibe going， Share some funny stories from your life， How to ask for a number。

 Give me your number， okay？， How to move her somewhere？， You know what。

 I know a great place let's go， So you guys see this doesn't have to be a complicated thing。

 We can make it complicated， We can make it very complicated， Or we can keep it simple， Ultimately。

 you never have an excuse， You always have to have that stuff on autopilot。

 You have to have something， So always have something， Let me take a side。

 let me take a sort of a side tangent here， Sort of a side tangent I want you guys to understand。

 What a lot of guys will do when they're first learning to be good with women。

 Is they'll have the perception that， You know， someone who's very good with girls。

 Has to be very different from who they are， Like， they might， you know。

 they might look at a guy like me， And they might say， well， he just looks like what I look like。

 What's the difference？， What's the difference between me and him？。

 And it's a very subtle difference， But a lot of guys will do is because they're so convinced。

 That they have to be different in order to get women。

 Is they won't be able to convey their natural personality to a woman properly。

 So what they'll do is they'll speak differently， They'll tell different kinds of jokes。

 They'll change their personality around， And the woman can sense it。

 She can sense the lack of congruence， She can feel that。

 What a lot of guys think is they need some fancy lines。

 Or something very different to make that shift， They think that a guy who's good at picking up women。

 Should have rocket boots on or something like that。

 So there's a clear distinction in their mind of the regular guy， And， you know。

 the pickup superstar， They think that there has to be this really big difference。

 Between those two characters in order to process it in their minds。

 If you guys ever heard of like ego defense mechanisms。

 That's like where a guy will be talking to a woman， And unconsciously。

 he doesn't want to feel the pain of rejection， So unconsciously， he'll act a little bit weird。

 a little bit off， So that when she is not receptive， his unconscious mind says， Well， it wasn't me。

 That wasn't my real personality that I put out there， To be good with women。

 you have to really be able to put yourself out there。

 You have to really put your personality on the line， You have to put it out there to， you know。

 it's like you've got to put your head on the chop， Like， you know， on the chopping block。

 In the lines head， completely comfortably， Knowing that it'll be okay， Knowing that it'll be fine。

 Because when you do that， it communicates to the woman。

 That you're comfortable with who you are and you're confident with who you are， And she'll like you。

 It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy， So never think there has to be this huge distinction between what you have already。

 And， you know， what you have to become， It's something that will evolve naturally。

 it'll evolve on its own， But don't get too caught up in it， okay。

 We don't need to over complicate anything， Why do we go to nightclubs？。

 Why do I like to do nightclubs， In order to learn how to meet women。

 Does that mean that learning how to meet， you know。

 that the best place to meet a woman is a nightclub？， No。

 But why is a nightclub a good place to practice？， First of all。

 clubs are one of the few venues that has all the girls you need， If you go out to a shopping mall。

 Not all shopping malls， I've seen some， you know， in Montreal， Sydney， places like that。

 Or there's just women everywhere， But a lot of shopping malls， you'll talk to one girl， You know。

 that'll go for a bit， it runs out， And then you're stuck looking all over the mall for another five minutes trying to find the next girl。

 During those five minutes， you're getting inside your head， You know。

 you're starting to micromanaging yourself， You're second guessing yourself。

 You're looking for the girl when you finally find that girl， The next thing that you know。

 you don't come across right because you is taking you too long。

 The best way to practice is just to go somewhere where there's a lot of women。

 And just have fun with it so that you can talk to one girl， As soon as that ends， turn around。

 next girl， talk to her， As soon as that ends， turn around， next girl， That's how you build momentum。

 that's how you'll get yourself in a state， That's how you get yourself really talkative and having a good time and being carefree。

 Which are the exact qualities that will attract the woman。

 So try to go to places that are very social， that are conducive to that。

 where there's a lot of women around， Clubs also make daytime seem easy， If you can work a nightclub。

 you can easily work daytime， Because you're going into the venue where there's more stimulation。

 That's great， no matter what your age， there are clubs of all different age groups for whatever it is that you like。

 Whatever it is that you like， you can find it， You know。

 even if it takes a little bit more searching， you can find it。

 The other really cool thing about clubs that I like is that clubs will teach you the attitudes and style of interactions。

 Of the kind of guys that get girls， Like when you go to a club， you got， you got， I mean。

 if you actually look at， you know， especially the more exclusive clubs。

 Unattractive people are afraid to go there， The reason why there's a lot of attractive people in the club is because unattractive people feel uncomfortable there。

 So when you're going into a nightclub where there's a lot of attractive people。

 You're putting yourself into that world and you're climatizing yourself to it。

 I always encourage people to just take a step up， you know。

 go a little bit higher than what you're used to， Get comfortable in that environment， And then。

 like for me， you know， growing up in a smaller town， And then moving， you know。

 to places like LA and New York， Going back to the smaller town， it was like a turkey shoot。

 It was crazy， It's like being 25 and going back to play high school football， It's awesome。

 So you guys want to do that， you want to go to those places， you want to challenge yourself。

 Go to those places， get comfortable in those places， You only feel the rewards of it， You know。

 there's kind of some unhealthy lifestyles that can go on in those places。

 It doesn't mean that you have to get involved in that， you can stay detached from that。

 You don't need to feel pressured in anything， I definitely don't ever， But just being around that。

 you can learn a lot， Clubs teach you how to hold court。

 They teach you how to go into a group of people， hold attention， Clubs teach you how to be a friend。

 large groups of people， They teach you how to handle social pressure。

 A club is designed to disorient you， A club has got music， stimulation， people having fun。

 When you go out to a nightclub， everyone looks like they're having more fun。

 Everyone looks like they're having more fun than you， You see guys dancing with girls。

 everyone looks like they have stuff going on， But the truth is that a lot of people don't realize。

 Is that if you go out to a club， even by yourself， And you know， you talk to 10 people。

 If even one of them you have a fun interaction with。

 You probably met 100% more new people than most of those people that club did。

 Because most of those people that club came with their friends， their cousins， their social circle。

 And they didn't talk to anybody， Meanwhile， you actually went out there and put yourself out there。

 So even though it might feel like they're having more fun than you， It's an illusion， it's not true。

 Put yourself out there， it's like you know the truth， You know what you're about。

 and that's something that you want， And even if it's not as comfortable， you're doing it。

 And you know， it might not be as glamorous， But you're going out there and you're making it happen。

 and believe me eventually， It will be very glamorous， And those same guys who are going there。

 you know， with their cousins or social circles， And they're dancing with like three girls。

 they look like pimps， but they're not actually with any of them， And they'll see a guy like you。

 who after you know a period of time， Can talk to anybody and they say， wow man， you're awesome。

 That's so cool that you can do that， and they'll really respect you。

 So that's something you can build up， Clubs will also teach you how to out-alpha obnoxious guys。

 Which is great， When you go to a club， guys will often try and tool on you， You know， they're drunk。

 they're cocky， You know， women will try to act like they're on a pedestal。

 sometimes they can be bitchy， And you can learn how to interact with that。

 you can learn to be comfortable with that， Because a lot of the time when guys will try and tool on you。

 you know， you tool them back a bit， you joke around。

 And you can actually start to like each other and become friends， Same thing with women， you know。

 they'll kind of be like testy with you， You know， you're sort of testy with them back， you know。

 you get used to that whole like bitch front attitude， And when you get used to that。

 you can interact with that kind of thing， It gives you a lot of social skill。

 it just gives you a lot of power to get used to that， So it's worth getting used to， You know。

 in conclusion， guys， go out to clubs， You know， keep playing with it， learn about it。

 you'll benefit， If you can't do clubs， If that's not an option for you， which for some of you guys。

 maybe you have a job that doesn't allow it， Maybe you just simply hate them so much。

 it's not something that you're interested in doing， That's fine too， But ultimately。

 it's your responsibility to find a place where you can meet women， That's your responsibility。

 It varies from city to city， And it's something that you're going to have to work towards。

 We have a question over here， can we give that microphone？， I definitely prefer health clubs。

 I don't drink， I don't smoke， I'm in the drugs， I'm in the health scene。

 So I meet women at health clubs， Of course， most of them are not hot。

 but I have been in the health club， Health club， a few more， I think it's what health club is here。

 I'm definitely more comfortable with health club than in the bar， I don't drink， Well， because me。

 I haven't drank in years， You know， I don't use drugs， I don't smoke， I don't even dance， man， Well。

 I kind of do， but it's not pretty， So， when you go out to a night club。

 a lot of guys will think you have to be able to go on the dance floor， You have to drink。

 a lot of guys will even think that you have to have a drink in your hand and you approach women。

 Which is so funny， The truth is， whoever has a stronger belief in themselves will affect the other person。

 So if I go up to a girl and I don't have a drink on me， and she says， where's your drink？。

 A lot of guys will try to say， Oh， I'm just so wasted， you know， some drinking， party， No。

 I don't say that， I say， I'm not drinking， why aren't you drinking？， So， I don't want to， That's it。

 that's all you say， You know， if they say， where's your friends？， You say， I don't know， I'm lost。

 like Pinocchio， What？ I don't know where I am， can you help me？， Right？ Just whatever。

 you don't react to it， okay？， Don't show any kind of reaction to it。

 If you don't want to go out to a nightclub because you just don't want to， that's one thing。

 But definitely don't fear that the lifestyle has nothing to do with it， Also， I mean， look。

 what it comes down to is this， You must find， to get good with women， you must meet women。

 you must interact with women， So， whenever you do， find， like。

 you know how I learned to be good with women？， College， At my college。

 there was girls all over the place， So， my first year of approaching women was all during the daytime。

 And， you know， there was little cafes at night time that I could go to places like that。

 And they're great， they're fantastic， But the reason why I like the nightclub is because when I finally got over my fear of it。

 What happened was， you know， there's 50 women in there， So， you just go， go， go， go， go。

 And you can get on such a role， you get on such a role， But wherever you go， wherever it is。

 go to a place where you can get on a role， And you can approach a lot of women and just get used to it and just get it under your belt。

 Eventually， this becomes the thing of the past， You'll go out。

 you'll approach about one woman a night， That's if she doesn't come to you， That's it， But for now。

 you're an alerting phaser， newbie mission， And newbie mission means you've got to get experience under your belt。

 I've seen guys who will give advice like， you know， you don't need to do newbie mission， You know。

 it can just happen when you're out， Well， hold up， That's great， that's a destination。

 That's a goal that you get to， And you can get to it very quickly， But the newbie mission。

 the one thing in common that you'll see with any guy who's good with women。

 This is a very big common thing you'll see， Is that they spent several years being total try hard。

 total dorks， Just working their asses off to get good with women， And then they go， you know。

 I didn't even need that， that was just stupid， You know， it was totally unnecessary。

 I just realized I could just gotta be myself， But the truth is。

 they've all gone through that process， There's a commonality， we've all done it。

 The reason that we all say， all that's so dorky， it's so try hard。

 Is because our minds have recognized that this probably would not be something to continue doing。

 Because we have to focus on other areas of our lives， But in order to build that skill set。

 you want experience， Experience comes from going out， So you must get experience under your belt。

 You know， every city is different， every city has different places， But ultimately。

 the responsibility is on your shoulders to find where the women are。

 You must figure out where these women are， I got to meet them， And have fun with it， Confidence。

 Women are gonna be able to tell a lot from you very quickly by your eye contact， your voice。

 your body language， The way that you touch your social skills， what you put up with， Why is that？。

 When you approach a woman， what you're gonna find is that when you're on， it opens up。

 It just opens right up， When your eye contact is good， when your voice is on， when you're relaxed。

 When you're having a good time， you know， what guys will do is the approach， You know， rigid。

 not able to hold eye contact， nervous， stuttering， They get blown out immediately。

 Any sign of weakness， you're gonna， you know， it's not gonna go far， It's not gonna go anywhere。

 When you go in confident， cool， and like you're not trying to take any value from her。

 You're not trying to， you're not trying to pull some kind of trick or something like that。

 It'll go great， Have you guys ever noticed how women all talk to each other？。

 Like women do not reject other women， Because women realize that the other woman doesn't want anything from her。

 They're not trying to do anything， But if you're walking around going， okay。

 I've got to do my practice， I've got to do my 10 approaches tonight， Okay。

 I'm on approach number six， where's my approach number six？， Where is she？ Okay， there she is， Okay。

 where's my line？， Okay， look at， all right， okay， here I'm gonna do this， Oh， Jesus， man， Okay。

 let's go， Like that， you go in， And obviously it's gonna be a lot tougher than if you're just having fun。

 and she feels that you're just having fun， If the girl can feel that you're just having a good time。

 she's just gonna want to be a part of that， It's gonna go fantastic， So you always want to just be。

 you know， keeping her， showing her that you're having fun with it， Showing。

 so much of this game is in your eye contact， That is so much of this eye contact。

 that one little thing， Because she's looking at you， and she's seeing if your pupils are dilating。

 because you're nervous， and your mind is racing， She's seeing if you could hold her eye contact。

 She's seeing if your voice is gonna fluctuate when she teases you a little bit。

 She's gonna see if you're uptight， she's looking at that stuff。

 That's what she's checking you out for， So that stuff right there is， you know， that's like a huge。

 huge key to this， How do you develop that？， You work on it in your day-to-day life。

 When you go out from now on， keep eye contact with people。

 Make sure that your voice is as strong as theirs， Or not even necessarily as strong。

 but as unreactive， So that you're not being sucked into the way that they're acting， You know。

 you have your own way of acting， and you don't react to the way other people are acting。

 If you guys can get that down， you're gonna find immediately that women are a lot more receptive to you。

 It's gonna be an immediate， instant thing， How are your social skills with men？

 Were you able to have normal conversations just walking up to， Strangemen or strangers who were men？

， And just open up conversations and have conversations socially， Were you already a social person。

 but you were stunted with women？， I know， I was pretty poor in both areas， Yeah， pretty poor。

 One of the things that I never got growing up was like how guys will kind of。。。。

 Like the way the guys treat each other， I never got that。

 because I kind of thought it was weird and unnecessary， You know。

 guys like to sort of bust each other's balls， joke around， And I'd see that kind of thing。

 and I just didn't understand it， I didn't understand what it was communicating。

 what the purpose of it was， I just thought， look， why aren't you just acting normal， dude？， Like。

 you know， like ask a guy a question， he gives me some silly answer， And I would think， it's stupid。

 you know what I'm bothering me， you don't annoy me， Right， so， yeah， now it's， you know。

 that's something that you sort of build， Right， I mean， learning about this stuff， you know。

 you learn to understand women，， which is what we're about to talk about。

 You learn to understand yourself， and you learn to understand other men。

 And that's sort of something that， you know， gives you that really bigger picture。

 The way that you interact with the world， Let's talk about female psychology。

 Where women stand in all this？， The first thing that you have to remember about female psychology。

 This is that you've got to always remember this， Always got to be in your head when you're talking to a girl。

 Is that she has been socially conditioned to act as if she does not enjoy sex， That right there is。

 that's like tops on the list， You know， some extreme examples of that would be like。

 you're with a girl， You know， say guys with a girl， and they want to get on the bus together。

 And she says， I can't bring you on the bus with me， I'm not bringing you back to my house。

 we're not getting on the bus， She says， come on， let's go， she goes， no， it says， okay。

 let's say here in talk， They stay there and they talk， and they wind up going behind the building。

 And having sex beside the dumpster， Why would something like that happen？。

 Why do you guys think that she won't let them on the bus。

 But she would have sex with them behind a building？， What do you think？， Any guesses？。

 Doesn't count， nobody will see it， Yeah， she can't let you know that she's willing to have sex。

 It has to be in the moment， Yeah， all good answers， The girl is not going to do something， usually。

 that leads it， that leads towards sex if it's her responsibility， Most girls。

 if they have sex with a guy， if you ask them how it happened。

 the operative word that they will always say is it just happened。

 Any time that you want to girl hook up， the way that she should view it after is it something just happened。

 It just， yeah， just happened， She should never view it as， yeah， you know。

 I want them so I'd only come home with me， These things， you know， those things occur。

 they'll go on， the better that you get with women， the more often that they'll occur。

 But for the most part， you want to take all responsibility off of her shoulders。

 you want to be the leader， The woman wants you to be the leader and to make it happen。

 to figure it out for yourself， Don't ever put her in a situation where she is accountable。

 A woman should never be accountable for why you guys wound up having sex。

 Say that you're talking to a girl to club and you want to go back to your house， You shouldn't say。

 you know， even if you've kissed， you shouldn't say， you know。

 you want to go back to my house so we can finish this off， Because she's going to say， no。

 you just say， you know what？ I've got these really kick ass home videos at home。

 I want to come show them to you， Boom， done， you took the responsibility off her shoulders。

 If you want her to come sit on your bed， say you've got a digital camera， Hey。

 I've got these really cool pictures， come and see them， just walk in， sit on your bed。

 She'll sit down， Boom， problem solved， But you can never put that accountability on her shoulders。

 I remember being out with this guy， we were with two girls。

 it was after the club we were in a taxi cab， And he said to them， so， want to go back to my place？。

 Both the girls said， no， and I said， we've got this really cool movie， Eddie Murphy Raw。

 we're going to watch it， We should go watch it， they're okay， And he says， oh。

 sorry going back to my place， they're like， no， I said， I'm going to go watch Eddie Murphy Raw。

 Like， okay， and he's like， cool， alright， so we're going back to my place， No， boom。

 and they're gone， they're out of there， Okay， So， you always want to be moved。

 you want to keep them comfortable， you want the woman to feel like， Just things are moving along。

 you're having a good time， And， you know， the truth is， it's kind of very counterintuitive。

 you want to really be having a good time， You want to be doing the stuff that you want to do。

 the way that you get girls is you just， you pull them into your world。

 You show them what you like to do， what you think is fun， you show them， you know。

 they just enjoy seeing what you're about， A lot of guys think that they have to do something that the girl thinks is fun。

 but that's not necessarily true， The girl isn't enjoying getting to know you。

 so she's going to want to find out what you're about， So。

 if you can pull her into that and show it to her from like a real， like， some place of authenticity。

 a place of realness， And you're showing that to her not from a place of reaction or wanting her approval。

 But just because it's something that you like to do and it's fun and you're doing it anyway。

 She's going to be drawn into that and she'll be drawn into your world and she'll love you for it and she'll enjoy it。

 So that's what the direction that you want to take it in。

 The way that sex tends to work is that the woman is observing your personality。

 And once she's ready， she chooses you， You can't really choose her， you kind of do， right？

 The whole who chooses who frame is sort of a complicated issue。

 Because another way of putting it is you're the guy who has so many girls wanting them that you select。

 right？， Like the rock star frame， right？ He's got girls lining up outside， he selects one。

 And that's sort of one of the ways of looking at it that you can have also。

 But in the end of the day， it's the woman's decision of whether or not she wants to have sex。

 It's not your decision as hers， So， you know， she is the chooser。

 And the way that you get her to choose is by showing her enough of yourself that she wants it。

 And what will generally happen is as she starts to want it， she gives you little indications。

 And that you can move it forward， And kind of keep it there for a while， you know。

 maybe she's comfortable holding hands， whatever it is， Keep it there for a while， she's comfortable。

 you move forward a bit more， But you're waiting for her to choose you。

 This is sort of a complicated issue because you don't want to view it as like， you know。

 she's on the pedestal or whatnot， So it's a different way of looking at it。

 you can also sort of reverse that frame and choose her， So we'll get into that more later。

 But ultimately you guys have to remember that， You have to remember that aspect， You have to be you。

 you have to be in your own reality， you have to do your own thing。

 And trust that she will choose you because of who you are。

 Women live in the emotion of the moment and backwards rationalize it， What I've just said here。

 Women live in the emotion of the moment and backwards rationalize it。

 Is one of the things that guys have the most trouble with in this entire thing。

 It's just one of the trickiest things that guys find about this entire process。

 You could say to your girlfriend， you know， let's go to the gym， And she'll say no。

 And then you tickle her and you tease her and you spin her around， You say。

 let's go to the gym and she goes， okay， boom， like that， Whatever emotion she's in。

 she goes with it， Women live in that emotion of the moment。

 You could be talking to a girl who you just met and say hey， you want to hear。

 Let's go to this restaurant and she'll say no， Because you weren't making her laugh enough or maybe you weren't being confident enough。

 Then you just say two or three things that make her laugh。

 You say let's go and her mind completely changes， Completely changes。

 Women are always living in the emotion of the moment。

 A woman can say that she hates you and be kissing you a minute later。

 A woman can say that she loves you， please call me。

 And then you call her and she's ironing so she's bored。

 And she doesn't feel that same emotion and it just went away， That's how it always is。

 What men are always trying to do is to， you know， lodge a size， Right。

 they're trying to constantly trying to persuade her of things， And it simply doesn't work。

 The operative word here or the operative， you know， the maxim。

 That you always have to remember is this， Change her mood， not her mind。

 If you can remember that one thing， your relationships will be easier， You know。

 all of your interactions with women will be much， much easier， Change her mood， not her mind。

 If you want to change a woman's mind， Just put her in a great， fantastic mood， get her laughing。

 Just get her giggling， having great time， And then just restigets whatever you suggested。

 Maybe in a slightly different way so she doesn't quite pick up on that， And， you know， and bang。

 change her mood， not her mind， Women are always living in the emotion of the moment。

 When you talk to a girl， say you open a conversation， And you ask for， you know。

 the name of some dogs you want to name， If she loves dogs， she'll say， I love dogs。

 And she loves you now， because you're proud of dogs。

 But you've got like that one girl in 20 that hates dogs， And you start the conversation with that。

 just， I hate dogs， And she looks you， I hate you， Right？ She hates you。

 because you said something that she doesn't like， Women， when they hear words。

 they have associations to those words， And whatever emotions they feel from those associations。

 they put towards you， That's how it goes， And of course some guys then will try and stack all these words together。

 to make the girl feel like a super-say towards them and whatnot， And it could work。

 but at the same time it's very reactive and women can sense that， So it can mess you up as well。

 Ultimately though， just remember， the woman is always living in the emotion of the moment。

 A lot of the， see， most guys are thinking， most guys， the way that they decide they like a girl。

 Is they'll find some girl they like， they'll get a crush on her， But you know。

 they'll start to develop a little infatuation， They'll have that decision that they like her。

 And then they want her to feel the same towards him， They think that that's necessary， Of course。

 if that's how things were， people would never hook up。

 It would be almost impossible to statistically， So the reality is。

 the woman one moment may have no attraction for you， no interest in you。

 She could even be turned off of you， But a second later you said one little thing that just sort of stuck with her。

 She thought was funny or fun， Bang， her emotions just changed。

 Just completely turned around and she feels completely differently about you。

 And that will go on for a long period of time， Because when you first meet a new woman。

 Her experience with you， if it's one minute long， And one sentence that you said was like one that made her feel bad。

 And one that you said made her feel good， Her emotions were about 50 good， 50 bad。

 In a longer relationship when she's had a 99% positive experience with you。

 One little thing is no big deal， although they'll still freak out， And then you just。

 we'll talk about how to deal with that later， But point is。

 is that women are always living in the emotion the moment， You could always change your mood。

 Don't worry about， don't be thinking what she's thinking。

 Don't always be thinking what she's thinking， Just be having fun and count on the fact that her state will change。

 If you can change your state， your result， you'll get the result that you want。

 We talked about how guys who are non-judgmental， And have a carefree attitude towards sex。

 We'll have a lot more luck with women， I have a little analogy， I call that the secret society。

 It's kind of a well-known analogy， and I have this sort of article that I wrote on at one point。

 The basic gist of it is that there's a double standard， Get that into your head。

 there is a double standard that women have for one type of guy， And for another type of guy。

 The same woman， like you could be dating a girl for three months。

 You're dropping her off at 10 o'clock like a gentleman， Shilurahs。

 And as soon as she gets back to her house， she's calling up her other guy to come over to her house。

 And this happens all the time， all the time， Any of you guys here who are players know that a lot of the girls that you're dating or that you're seeing。

 Probably have some guy that's also taking them out for dinners， spending money on them。

 trying to buy their affection， And you know， she might even say to you。

 I hate it that I'm attracted to you， I hate it， Because this other guy is so nice。

 he's such a nice guy， Why can't I stalk on you？， And the reason why is because it's a double standard。

 There's a certain type of man who can walk comfortably among women。

 Who has that ability to get a certain type of treatment that other guys don't get。

 There's a certain type of guy that women will have three sums with。

 There's a certain type of guy that a woman will sleep with right away。

 Then there's a certain type of guy who a woman will be complete prudent with。

 And that's the guy who's judgmental， he brings that on himself。

 He brings that on himself by being judgmental towards women and by putting too much of value on the interaction。

 By taking it too seriously and the girl knows that if she just wants to have a little fun。

 That he's going to make a big deal out of it， he'll probably cry if she doesn't call him back。

 stuff like that， A lot of you guys here probably think， I bet if I were to ask。

 Most of you guys here think that if you're coming in from out of town。

 And a girl asks you if you live in that town， that you'd be better off to say that you live in that town。

 Most of you guys probably think that， like if you go visit Miami， And you're there for a visit。

 the girls just do you live here？， Most guys are probably like， well I'm thinking of moving here。

 Because then it's like the girl can see that you have a long trip possibility， totally not true， Go。

 nope， leave him tomorrow， And you drastically created a good situation for you。

 I don't think that you should actually， like if you live in the town in the girl ask。

 I don't think you should make it up， Because it's just unnecessary， it's totally unnecessary。

 But the point is， understand that women enjoy sex as much as men， You've got to understand that。

 that's like a key shift in thinking， The whole women don't enjoy sexing is a front， it's not true。

 Women enjoy sex as much if not more than men， If you think back to the last time you had sex。

 who was the one that was screaming？， Who was the one who went out and had to orgasm？。

 Your body was jittering， it's a woman， unless you're like really into it， So， so， you know， oh god。

 that is the woman， So， women enjoy sex， they have strategy guides， Women have strategy guides。

 it's a Cosmome magazine， What's the woman's favorite show， Sex in the City？。

 What are women thinking about？ It's all like that。

 They're always looking for some cool guy to come along， They're waiting for it。

 they're waiting for that guy to come， Don't believe the hype， don't buy into it。

 Women enjoy sex just as much as men， Women enjoy sex just as much as men。

 The majority of women have had more sex than men have。

 The vast majority of men have had sex with very， very small number of women。

 Most women who are attracted to have had sex with more than most men have for the simple fact that they have options。

 A woman could reject like 10，000 guys and have sex with like one out of every 10，000。

 And she still have more sex than most guys have， Because she has so many options being thrown at her constantly。

 This can actually screw women up because they have sex thrown at them so constantly。

 It's going on all the time that their minds are like。

 They have these kind of interesting ways of thinking about it。

 Where literally the guy who just stands out from the other guys。

 The guy who's just the most different from all the other guys is the guy she'll wind up with。

 Not even the guy who has the most logical qualities going for him。

 Just the guy who stands out from the hordes and legions of never-ending guys that want something from her。

 That one guy that stands out and seems different from them if it's like in a kind of a cool way。

 A lot of the time will be the guy who wants to get in the girl。

 That's why if you wear some funky thing out to a club that you think is stupid。

 And you're getting approached by women constantly and you're seeing all this attraction。

 You thought that by being a conformist a generic and trying to fit in would help you。

 But in fact doing anything that you can to stand out is such a powerful thing。

 If you guys have ever seen a guy with an Australian or British accent come into America。

 You know what I'm talking about here， Why standing out is so important。

 Anything that makes you stand out is so powerful， Women。

 when you approach women what you'll notice is they have this kind of eye code that they do with each other。

 I don't know if some of you guys have ever seen this before， When you approach a group of girls。

 You're talking to them， you're making them laugh and they're constantly looking at each other。

 They're doing these little looks like that and they almost do it simultaneously like， Pfft。

 like that as they feel the different emotions， They're looking to see if their friends are enjoying it as well。

 Because if their friends are not enjoying it then it's like they don't want to get judged by their friends for enjoying it。

 So as long as their friends are enjoying it and they're having a good time。

 The women will be enjoying it too， Women enjoy going to clubs in particular because it's a great。

 well for one they like to dance， But also they get a lot of validation from it。

 From a woman's perspective a club has great music if it's a club she likes， It's got lights。

 you know， these crazy lights going on， It's got guys coming up and talking to them。

 it's got alcohol， A club is just a giant state pumping venue。

 A club is a place where girls can go and just go nuts and just blow off steam and have a great time。

 And they can get hit on by guys， The girls will tell you I hated that I can't dance though getting hit on by guys。

 But at the same time that same woman， you know， as she gets a bit older。

 Will complain about the fact she's not getting hit on by guys。

 Because it's a source of validation for her， Women are constantly getting revalidated。

 What's the first thing that a woman does as soon as she breaks out with her boyfriend？， I mean。

 again， I'm making huge generalizations here， I'm probably wondering why she's saying I don't do that。

 And that's fair but what a lot of women do， As soon as they break up with a boyfriend， bang。

 they go hit up the club， They're not even necessarily looking to have sex， Some are some aren't。

 But they go hit up the club， bunch of guys come and hit on them， Pumps are stayed up， boom。

 they're fixed， They feel better， it's actually a horrible crutch， But I don't blame them。

 I probably do too， If I could go out to the club and just get hit on， So， you know。

 that's what's going on there， But on some level， they're also always hoping to meet that cool guy。

 Like they're going there， women will dance for hours。

 And most of them just do the same kind of little moves over and over and over。

 There's dance and dance and dance and dance， It's like this programming in them to just dance。

 It's like this kind of subtle exhibitionism， And it's a way to pump their own state up。

 One of the things that we do on bootcamp， we do， Like what I realize on bootcamp all the time。

 Is about once an hour， I'll pull the guys on the dance floor， And make them just do silly things。

 Because it actually pumps their states up， And when they're states are pumped， Upon state pumping。

 when I can pump up the students' state， They're so outside， they're head， they're so on。

 That they'll just rock， you know， those kick ass， And the reason that I think that that's important is because you should be doing that to yourself。

 Not just on a bootcamp， you should always be pumping your own state。

 Whenever you're going out to a club， Just like the girls are， Because if you're in a downer state。

 And you're just a drag， and meanwhile the women's states are pumped， It just doesn't match。

 so you always want to be doing that， Next thing， The women are always protecting each other。

 From that guy coming along， It's not interesting， It's actually a very interesting thing about the way things work。

 As a guy， would you ever see your friend talk into a girl and go。

 We're trying to have a fun night here， it's guys' night out， We're going， Okay。

 That's something that you could say to girls is a joke， To reverse the frame。

 But ultimately you wouldn't say that， Women have a very interesting sort of thing going on。

 I call that buying temperature， Buying temperature is this， Women have two forces in their minds。

 Two conflicting forces， All people do， but we'll talk about women here， Logic and emotion。

 Logic and emotion， Logic is social conditioning， Their logic is always saying。

 Don't have sex with guys， Don't appear to be a slut， Protect your reputation， Don't be judged。

 Be selective， Her emotions on the other hand are telling her something very very very different。

 Her emotions are telling her to act like a guy basically， Because she wants sex， She wants that。

 it's part of her drive， It's an innate healthy part of a healthy female drive is to have sex。

 Logic and emotion， Logic and emotion cancel each other out， Have you ever gotten into a fight？。

 Who is being a nasty fight before？， A couple， you just didn't want to admit it guys？。

 Can now be like all these guys are admitting it， Sounds like cooler， When you're in a fight。

 you know it's not worth it， A fight is never worth it， Fighting is stupid， it's lose-lose。

 Because no matter how much you win， you're going to take some shots too， But the thing is。

 when you are so pissed， When you're so angry， And it doesn't matter that maybe there's a bouncer there。

 Or that you're going to get in trouble or that it's stupid， Everything about is dumb。

 You're so angry that that just takes over you， And you can't hold it back and you just don't care anymore。

 It's the same thing as like say you have a girlfriend and she's on the pill。

 And then she goes on antibiotics， And many of you guys have ever had that situation。

 And her pill is not effective， See some nods of recognition right？， And you're like okay baby， Okay。

 we're not going to have sex， For the next week till your antibiotics were off， And okay。

 we can use cons， But you say that you have a girlfriend and she's on the pill， Right？， Okay。

 we can just make out， Okay， yeah， we can just make out， Okay， yeah， we won't do anything， it's fine。

 Keep going， keep going， Two-three hours of that later， It's like， What time of the month is it？。

 Do you think you can get pregnant？， I can pull out， I swear to God， I'll pull out， Right？， Boom。

 have sex， Even if you pull out， Oh man， how do you feel after you do that， man？， Oh。

 you feel stupid， Oh， damn， that is stupid， That is so stupid。

 Because now you've got a way to find out if she's pregnant。

 And especially if you weren't looking for a kid at that point， But it's that emotion。

 You logically know you shouldn't do it， But as the emotion takes over。

 It's canceling out your logic， It is canceling it out， And emotion is taking over。

 And you can't think， And you just go by your biological drives， Your biological drives。

 Whether it's fighting， sex， whatever it is， And you're going off of that。

 Women's biological drive is to have sex， She wants that， But she's always suppressing it。

 The woman is constantly suppressing her desires， She's always pushing it down。

 Because society is hungry， it's bad， It's evil， you know， you go to hell， Whatever it's telling her。

 It's constantly telling that， She's constantly suppressing it， As a guy， when you go in there。

 And you just joke around， You just joke around， joke around， joke around。

 And you're so utterly silly， That she loses sight of that logic。

 And her more sexual side will come out of her， It's a natural thing， I think so many guys。

 They're always out there trying to figure out all these techniques to meet women。

 What is all about such a huge part of meeting women is just making them laugh， That's it， humor。

 If you can just be confident and make a woman laugh， That's like 90% of this。

 Confidence and laughter， Just keeping her laughing， But also not being a clown。

 Not making her laugh from a point where you're losing your power， Like dancing monkey。

 But just keeping her from a point where you're just making your laugh。

 You're maintaining your power， That's just the kind of guy that you are， Telling stories。

 talking about things that are interesting to her， Or that are even that are interesting to you。

 And interest her because she wants to find out what you're about， And just bring it on that angle。

 We'll talk more about that， But that's what buying temperature is， So let me give you an example。

 Say that you say to a girl， Let's go to this restaurant， And she says no。

 Most guys will say it's a really good restaurant， Or come on， we should go， What you're doing。

 that's like if someone's on a diving board， And you try to push them off。

 They're just going to dig their heels in more， As soon as the girl says to you， I don't want to go。

 Bang， go off of that conversational thread， Just cut it off， We're going to go to the restaurant。

 let's go， No， I can't， Awesome， Bang， next funny thing， joke， joke， stories， joke， then ask again。

 Do you guys see why？， It's all that buying temperature， It's the buying temperature， okay？。

 A woman is not like a man， A man is like a light switch， A woman is like a volume knob， A man。

 it's like binary man， You see that girl， you either you would or you wouldn't。

 The woman is deciding based on your personality as it's being exposed to her。

 So when you talk to the woman， At first， the first level of buying temperature is like。

 She's just willing to talk to you， Like you tap on the shoulder。

 she's willing to turn around and talk to you， It doesn't mean that she's willing to have sex with you。

 it doesn't mean she's willing to kiss you， It just means she's willing to turn around and talk to you。

 That's where the needle's at， You talk to her for a little bit， Maybe she touches you。

 Just very casually， She'll let you touch her， just casually whatever。

 It's just like the way you communicate， Just like how you communicate with your friends。

 She's exactly when you communicate with your friends， She's cool with that， Then you might say。

 Let me introduce you to my friend over there， Just 10 feet away， And she might say no。

 she may say no to that， The reason that she said no to that is because the needle's not there yet。

 Her buying temperature is not at that point， So you go cool， Boom， joke around， joke around。

 We'll talk about that later in the summer， joke around her， share stories， Then say， here let's go。

 She'll go， okay， the exact same girl who said no previously， Was not saying no。

 She was saying not yet， That's what a no is， a no is not yet， Unless it's like a scary。

 creepy or weird no， But for the most part， if you're a cool guy。

 And she's having a lot of fun with you， a no is not yet， What does that mean？。

 You don't get stuck on it， Like， he's really cool， He's really awesome， that will not work。

 You just joke around， have more fun with her， And if she continues to get to know you。

 Then she'll be willing to go over there， Then it's like， you know， will she do more contact？。

 Will she kiss you？， You could try to kiss a girl， And she says no， If she stays。

 if she's still staying and talking to you， And having a great time， It doesn't mean no。

 it means not yet， That's what she's saying to you， You'll see guys， if you go out to clubs。

 You'll see， especially like in big cities， You might see like some big athlete there for example。

 Some NFL football player， whatever， Like guys that are naturally just animals， Confident with women。

 They know what they're doing， they've had a lot of experience， And you'll see like， you know。

 you'll see like a guy， He's like hugging her and he's talking to her。

 And the girl is just so infatuated with them， She's so into him， he goes and try and kiss her。

 She's like， oh no， I could not do that， Right？， But then， you know， he keeps talking to her。

 He tries again， she pulls back in but no， she's not leaving， She's not going anywhere。

 she's staying there， she's having fun， So he just keeps talking， What's that doing？。

 That buying temperature is going up， And eventually he tries， gets in， See。

 whenever you try to escalate in any kind of way， And remember， anything's an escalation。

 a hand holds an escalation， Talking more is an escalation。

 Moving to talk to your friends is an escalation， Going to a restaurant is an escalation。

 A woman is probably a lot more willing to move within the venue， Like， you know。

 move around with you inside the venue， Before leaving the venue with you。

 A woman is probably a lot more comfortable going to a restaurant with you。

 That's close by that she's comfortable with， Than to go back to your house right away。

 So as she's getting to know you as her personality is coming out， The logic and emotion buttons。

 you know， the emotion is taking over， The logic is going down， she's getting to know you。

 She's feeling more attracted to you and then you just keep escalating it， If you go。

 if you move ahead a little， it's like a dance， It's like a dance with a woman like that kind of thing。

 If you move ahead a little bit too fast， she's not cool with it， That's fine， keep dancing。

 Move it later， that's okay， you'll just keep going like that， So think of it like that。

 don't think of it in terms of rejection， Most guys think， you know， they'll ask a girl， okay。

 come over here， She says no， and they think， well， that's it then because if。。。。

 Because I like her and she would have asked me， then I would have said yes， So obviously。

 she doesn't like me， that's not true， Any time that a girl is talking to you。

 she likes you at least to an extent， Because they have choice。

 A woman always has a choice not to be talking to you。

 You guys don't think an attractive woman is comfortable walking away from you。

 That woman has walked away from countless guys， Believe me， as soon as she's not having fun。

 she'll walk away from you， And if she does， that's cool too。

 But the point is that always interpret any kind of escalation， If it doesn't go。

 you just need that buying temperature thing， You're always moving it forward， okay？
