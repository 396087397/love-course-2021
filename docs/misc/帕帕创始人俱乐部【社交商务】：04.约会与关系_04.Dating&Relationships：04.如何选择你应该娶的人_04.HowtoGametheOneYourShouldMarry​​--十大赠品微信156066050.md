 Quite hard to make a long term Nikolai， When you think about it。

 You're the kind of person you want to spend your life with。

 A lot of that has to come with a long term history of trust， If you really know this girl。

 That's more important than anything else，57 weeks，2，1，19，23，3，ience。

有別，有別，自製，每次， In business， it's so critical， because there's so much money right estate。

 and these are people that you might not necessarily be。

 hanging out with all the time and like a relationship， we even have to put it out and riding。

 that's why a corporation's corporate attorneys exist， to write everything out。

 so we have to work with them， and spend tons of money every year。

 sometimes in the six figures every year， and it's very very important that you're kept in the loop。

 because of these things， your emotional bank account might get low with your girl。

 if you were kind of ignoring her， or working too hard in business， or too hard in fitness，更活動。。

 But look at what that is， build upon that and find those joint activities that you can do together。。

 Another thing that really helps is just surrounding yourself with really cool friends and family。

 and also getting involved with her friends and family。。

 When you get to the point where you're looking at actually selling down in a long term，。

 that's super mission critical， because when you're involved with these situations，，这些传闭着。

卑 matter，卑 matter，我的孩子們，有 really been， supportive of our relationship， and room windows。

 certain issues that might， come up in our relationship， whether it's like a conflict。

 because I might be traveling， too much or whether something， else has occurred。。

 By having supporter friends， I really， really like you， that will also end up。

 having your relationship， and have a lot of， more safety and more of a safety， net。。

 Same thing goes with her， family because then the， opposite happens。。

 You don't prefriend her family， and her friends， then you're going to have the。

 exact opposite happen。， It's a marriage。， It's going to happen for， a long term and you。

 definitely do not want that， to happen。， The other thing is having， people that are in a similar。

 situation is you， where you're a single guy，， most of your friends are， single。

 single guys and girls。， But when you're a， relationship， especially in a， marriage。

 having others that， are couples around you，， also significantly increase， your chances of success。。

 You have a lot more things， to talk about when you have， similar issues。， You could relate to them。。

 And you can also do couples， activities together。， You can go out and do， dual dates，， dual trips，。

 dual dual，， almost everything。， And then you're not just， relying on her to be the。

 sole source of your fun， or being the sole， source of your emotional， or her emotional support。。

 That's why I think it's， really important。， But together，， you can develop a life， together。

 life plans，， life goals。， And it's kind of like， developing a business， mission or business， vision。

， You kind of like have an， overarching strategy， which you accomplish。， And then you have these。

 little goals that you set， with each other。， Talk about them regularly。， See how close you are to。

 accomplish in those goals。， And then speaking what's， on your mind。， So many people in。

 relationships hold back， with their truey thinking， or afraid that the other。

 party is going to take， offense judge what you're， thinking。， And then as a result，。

 you look at you in a， less， favorable way。， More often than not，， though，， even when you're in a。

 situation where what you're， saying you think might， offend you at a person。

 or what you're saying is， not exactly what they want， to hear。， It's actually what they。

 want to hear。， It's actually what's going， to give them the confidence， and support into you。

 in your relationship， because the deeper you go， when being open，， forthcoming with the。

 partner that you have，， the more trust you're， going to have when times， are tough。。

 If you hold things back，， these things will add up to， a surprise and those。

 situations that may not be， as favorable will become， a lot worse。， So don't look at your。

 partner as it's one you， need to gain。， A lot of people will， continually ask me，。

 how do you gain a girl， that you want to have as， your girlfriend？， How do you gain the girl。

 that we want to have as， your partner？， Well， I guess in some sense，， there is some。

 gaming in the sense that， you're interacting， socially and you're using， rhythm and you're。

 combining or but I mean，， when I think about trying， to gain the girl，， it usually involves。

 some sorts of， thinking about strategy， in order to create， a certain perception。

 in a certain way a lot。， You can do some of that， because you want to be， viewed in the best light。

 to want to be a role model。， You want to do all these things。， You're studying things。

 and improve relationships。， So all part of that is， gaming。， I've had more importantly，。

 you want to view it as， like a partnership。， And so improving that， partnership，。

 improving the systems， and the overall， logistics of how your， relationship operate。。

 These are those things， you really want to tinker， with。， Similar to how you can view。

 your dating life as you're， the CEO of your own world， and you're managing。

 all the different moving， parts of it so that it， becomes a great success。。

 You can do the same thing， in just your one-on-one， relationship with your woman。。

 A lot of it could be， looking at what does she， need in order to accomplish， her goals。。

 That could be one focus of， yours and that her is how， to entertain her， and her is the romance。

 life that her is the sex， life that her is， you know all the time， that you need to spend。

 and taking it away from， your business so you can， talk and eventually， might be your family life。

 if you have children。， But breaking things， down to these categories，， focusing it，。

 managing it and trying to find， people that can help you， to accomplish these goals。

 but you don't have the time， to do this stuff。， I know the one-on-one， time you definitely have to。

 do with her。， But there's a lot of other， people that can also support。

 you with a law of the things， to carry the weight， of making sure her emotional。

 bank account is full。， Surround yourself with， items of the symbols of your。

 love and affection for your， woman whether it's like the， gifts， the things you do。

 together and the travels， from the various activities， you do。， It'll be a reminder of all。

 the good memories you have。， Put that around your house， where you live together。。

 I definitely do that。， This is little things，， little reminders，， little memories that mean a lot。。

 And by doing that，， all these little things will， help make your relationship。

 in the long term much stronger， and much more memorable， than the positive way。
