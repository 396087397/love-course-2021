# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：4.如果你有社交焦虑

什麼事情走了，你找到的你需要的，你知道，嗯，所以， For her，if she's like，you know what，I have a lot of，嗯，Social anxiety。

I have anxiety，In front of people，When I talk in front of people，of course，Come on up，You know。

I mean，What better reference to get，Similar to，If someone's in their head，Come on up。

or call them out，You know，This is the experience，That they need，It's the perfect situation to。

Sink into that，And it's also the perfect situation，To trigger it，I have any trouble with that。

Did I have any trouble with that，HELLNO，I came up on here，And I was a fucking natural。

Rocked it the first time，So first of all，Welcome up and，You know，Turn to the crowd，And like。

First thing I'd say，I just，Take it in，Like everyone's staring at you。

And let's tap into that same authenticity，What's the，What's the inner dialogue，So I make a really。

Take it in，You know，It's like，I want those sensations at the fucking surface，You know。

I don't want a little bit of，I'm a little scared，It's look at the fucking crowd，You're here in front。

Take it in，Let those sensations arise，And let's start by destroying this front，You know。

Start narrating what's going on，Right now，I'm really nervous，Okay，Try to ask yourself，Why。

What emotions，What sensations，Pop up you're looking，It's like，Not only is it a huge crowd，It's like。

There's also a lot of guys，I mean by the way，There's，Who here scared，Shillis a public speaking。

We're speaking in front of crowds，Or even in school growing up，Bullshit，It's all of you。

Everyone's fucking scared，Shillis a back，So let's kind of figure out， like。

Internally what's going on，What's kind of like，Broad up emotionally，What are the fears。

And then we'll kind of work on it，But for now just kind of，Nerry it，So you're looking around，Like。

Nerry the thoughts，Nerry the sensations，I don't really，I'm really stressed out，I'm not really sure。

Why，Why are you stressed out，Yeah，That's the problem I think，What are you afraid of people seeing。

What are you afraid you'll do，What are you afraid you won't do，I'm afraid I will come。

Office really nervous，That's something I would，That's something I would rather，Sorry， not do。

I'm suffering a lot，Good，What would be so bad，If you came off as nervous，I don't know，Show weakness。

I think it's，Yeah，It's scary，Yeah， it's scary，So again，What we're doing here is。

We're diving into the fear，You know，Whatever it is you fear，Follow the trail of，Why，It's like。

Oh my god I'm anxious，I'm anxious，I'm scared，Why，You know，Let it come up，And let's just sink into it。

Why，You know，It's like，Well，I'm afraid of just being very，Nervous，Okay，What's so bad。

If you're nervous，Right now，I'm just going deeper，And deeper，It's the same thing，Nervousness。

It's like，You know，Whatever it kicks in，We're all nervous at times，Yet，What happens。

Nervous equals bad，Nervous equals weakness，If people see weakness，What does that say about me。

Neverok to feel nervous，No，It's true，We're always trying to hide， Like feeling nervous。

Yet it's funny，It's like，Kind of linking it with you，It's like，If there's actually， Authentic。

Oh yeah I'm fucking nervous，We'd love that way more，Than someone was like，Trying to be cool。

Yet we all try to be cool，And everyone's telling you，Hide that，No，no，no，no，Anyone see。

If they see the nervousness，What will they think of me，You know，What else，Or even after saying this。

Narried，Let's talk about this，You really am really good，Speaking English。

But not because it's not my first language，It's horrible，There's stutter，The English is bad，Yeah。

It's good，I'm on my mid-length right now，You're not sure what to say。

What would be the worst case scenario，Of you coming up here on stage，Don't describe。

Just put the first thing，Pops in your mind，Worse case，This is a great question to ask。

What would be the worst case scenario，It really makes you bring your awareness。

To syncing deeper and deeper，What's the worst case scenario，And don't give me，The logical answer。

Give me really what，Pops up，Like syncing into that there，And as little sign out here too。

And I'm making fun of，You know，Yeah they're stuttering，You know you're English，Brava bra。

I'm making fun of it，To kill that front once again，That's trying to be cool。

Rombling her of her coping mechanism，Shaking，Okay what else，Like picture it。

Like the worst case scenario，See you came up here，And everything you feared came true，What happened。

You're actually，Well no that's logically，Yeah，Like here it's like about being honest，Like similar to。

Say me learning success with women，It's like logically，If you're like。

You know why are you so scared to go talk to her，In my mind I'm like，Well there's no reason。

But if I was actually honest，I'm like well if I say hi to her，Everyone will notice。

And the fucking dudes are going to come，Beat me up，And they're going to break a bottle on the bar。

And just stab me to death，That's how I feel，You know，So it's like worst case scenario。

Like painted no matter how unrealistic it is，Well the people would laugh at me，Okay。

I wouldn't know what to say，I wouldn't remember what I wanted to say，And then I'm just thinking。

I don't know，Good，Good，Keep going，What's going on，Basic me this，Just not knowing what to say，Shaking。

Well what's so bad about，Here it's really good，Like you're bringing a lot of authenticity out which is good。

It's like people are going to laugh at me，We all have that，Now let's kind of sink into it，It's like。

Well what's so bad if they do，What's so bad about，Even right now，You running out of things to say。

What is that trigger？，This is where the whole self acceptance，Like if I run out of things to say。

I need to depend on running out of things to say，Or similar，It's like I must keep this image intact。

What people see through me and laugh，It's usually in school，Not remembering what to say。

Getting bad grades，Or criticism，Or in groups， social groups， gatherings，Just people not liking me。

I think，So as you can see here，There's a lot more intense sensations that are surfacing。

You know she's getting a lot more emotional，And that's because we're going deeper and deeper into the fear。

You know we're blasting through layers of resistance，Instead of just saying on the surface like。

Social anxiety，Okay well let's release that，Go deeper，Why？，Why？，Why？。

You know I'm directing her right into what she fears，What happens if you're anxious。

I don't want people to see me nervous，Why，People not liking me，You know，BOOM。

We're going right deeper and we're hitting on something really authentic，Yeah，Yeah，I think that's it。

It's difficult，I don't really know，It's all that's coming to my mind right now，Okay。

What happens if people don't like you，How did you feel？，Rejected，Hello，I don't know，Just yeah。

Not in a place I want to be，Did it ever happen in school you did around。

I think it's to say where people did laugh，It's difficult I don't know。

No because I don't usually speak a lot in groups，So they don't talk in presentations，Yeah。

Oral exams where I didn't know what to say anymore and I had a bad grade，Or，Just shaking voice。

Never people laughing or never in a bad way，Okay，And as you can see here too if you go through the fear。

There's hurt， you know fear anxiety is covering up，Hurt。

Well first of all here as well say is like in terms of just。

How you guys feel off of this you can sense like the hardness，You know。

It's like you think at first it's like fear，In reality it's like you don't want to feel like that。

It's like you're fearing that hurt，You're feeling like okay what if people do this。

And this is again it's like paradigm one is optimize it。

So it's like most people will tell you okay well，If you're hurt here practice these confidence skills。

I'll give you this peak public speaking skill，I'll even give you a lot of opportunities to speak。

So you'll get more use to it，And that will be true that will help to some extent。

But it will never actually get to that cause where there's that fear of being hurt。

You'll just have more tools to keep running away，And avoiding being fully authentic vulnerable and being you know potentially being hurt。

And this is not just you this is like everyone，This is literally everyone you want to link it to him same thing。

If they see past if they see past if they see past，Why do we all fear rejection？。

You know we don't want to be alone we don't want to be abandoned，We don't want to be hurt。

You know or even feel like we're bad，It's another one。

But then it's kind of examining it's like diving into that as we said。

So it's like well what's so bad about that，What is so bad about people laughing，People judging you。

You've been fully real putting yourself out there，And people just not accepting it， Accepting it。

 Okay， And then it's zoning into the sensations， So now we're finally aware of what it is we want to let go of。

 Okay by using the crowd， We made all those sensations surface。

 And then what I did is I just kept guiding her following that trail of wise。

 Going deeper and sinking into it more and more and more， And now that it's there。

 We're going to release it going through the process。

 And I guess we'll do this here with you and we'll just do it all together， Have a seat。

 This is first of all yeah really， Congrats， Yeah， that's really good， Yeah， which by the way like。

 Well you just did here， I mean you guys fucking all know。

 It's like it requires so much fucking balls， Like it's insane。

 And yeah I mean for you which was interesting is like。

 You really didn't put on the front it was like immediately， Boom there， And this is great too。

 I mean just getting this reference of nothing that happening。

 And this huge crowd just cheering you on， I mean yeah， Awesome。

 It doesn't get to the cause but what better reference would you want。

 You know and it's so scary too， It's like oh I don't want to go in front and the fact you came in front of everyone。

 It's like this is what's up， Like I can guarantee you everyone fucking connected。

 Like it'd be way better than trying to be cool or anything like that， No？。

 It's like that's what you're like holy shit， And that's what stands out。

 And again it's like that's what everyone's fucking craving。

 It's like bring that out with other people and bring that out with yourself。

 Because the person we bullshit the most is ourselves。

 You know you can bullshit the whole crowd here but it's like。

 We just bullshit ourselves so the fact you brought that out， Really really good。

 And now it's like doing the opposite that is let's dive into it， And that's where it gets tough。

 And for me personally like in front of a crowd， Same thing as you like my biggest fear growing up in school was reading a book。

 I think I might be a little bit dyslexic but I sucked at reading out loud， So bad。

 And I was in Switzerland originally Switzerland， They make you read the book out loud in front of everyone。

 And everyone saw they'd switch like you take over。

 You take over at random and it felt like Russian roulette， I was like oh my god oh my god。

 And it took forever and you like you knew it was your turn。

 And then it was like it was so bad there was so much fear， And my first seminar was the same thing。

 Like I mean you did better than me at my first fucking seminar by far， Okay。

 Same for you like those glimpses of authenticity and you， They were like still glimpses。

 A little bit a couple， Was better than anything I did。

 Like my first seminar I went on stage was like， Supposed to be 10 minutes。

 This is like years ago in Los Angeles with Owen， He's like hey come up on stage 10 minutes man 10 minutes。

 Just prepare something， So I'm like oh fuck， My first assumption is somewhere to use like。

 It's school all over again but I got to do this， Willpower。

 So I'm like well I'll find comfort in knowing exactly what I'm going to say。

 So that's what I brought you up， It's like now what you're like， That's when authenticity kicks in。

 But I'm like okay I'm going to work on exactly what I'm going to say， Have it all prepared。

 And I'm there and it's a huge crowd， It was like 200 people I think， I was like fuck scared of shit。

 Listen to the back， My buddy is like you ready bro you ready。

 Like Owen walks in and he's like hey man， So it's actually going to be 30 minutes instead of 10。

 But gone， My whole plan gone， And he brings me up on stage and he like。

 Really really like talks me up， Like you know， One it's an extra challenge of trying to shove me in my head。

 But also like adding extra pressure， So he like talks five minutes like really loud。

 So it's like kind of like here like you guys are not talking。

 Imagine like for five minutes if I just keep talking really loud。

 You're going to kind of fall more into spectator than actually being here at present。

 If I'm like so， Like why would I be like kind of your head and I'm like you're turned。

 Like it's like that， And he's like what Julian's going to say is the best content you've ever heard in your life。

 So I'm like oh my god so everyone's expecting the best shit。

 Take it away and I'm like it was so bad， And I remember it was like there was massive nervousness。

 It required a lot of efforts and there was so much self-judgment too。

 Which is key is like I had my whole thing prepared。

 And I remember I missed a point and the entire rest of the seminar。

 Instead of just being here with it， I was in my head being like you fucking idiot。

 It's fucked now you missed that point， God it was horrible。

 And there was no it was me like against the crowd。

 And you trying to win the crowd over with like force， And said being like hey we're all here。

 It's like it's so funny how we assume like everyone's here working on themselves。

 This is the most positive friendly environments， Any of us could be in， You know it's pretty crazy。

 I mean yeah fuck yeah， It is， Yet our minds still always assumes， Oh my god oh my god oh my god。

 So I was like that and then you know a lot of references， Like I've mastered the going against。

 And I mean I don't know if you guys know it's like。

 If you guys read a previous one like a year or two ago， Two years ago。

 three years ago maybe very different vibe than now， You know it's still powerful。

 It's like it's the different place， And I can still go like really fucking loud， Still bring it。

 But it's no longer forced me against you， And when this happened for me as a little sign of。

 When this became permanent， It was only when I released all of that stuff。

 It was fueling that anxiety， That self-judgment that mean versus the crowd。

 Get to the cause and let it go， Okay but this is a great example of。

 You know using different environments to trigger you if you will。

 And then just keep going deeper and deeper and deeper， And then with her here of course it's。

 Letting go of them going through the process， And yeah letting go of that。

 Charge fueling that anxiety， That's how you make it fucking permanent。
