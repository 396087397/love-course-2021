ok this is not you sitting at home， not doing anything， and just looking at the video， like it's ok。

 maybe i should go out， it's ok， no， use your brain， use common sense，甚至不反對这段时间，选择只是很平久，但是， 我会想你们。

OK， how do not， OK， and just to make it clear here， I'm reading through some questions，。

 I don't want these to be just any little question that comes to mind， OK， like， this。

 should be your big sticking point， like， just think of it， if you only have one question。

 to ask this entire conference call， you only have one， what would be the most important。

 question you would ask versus， like any question， you know， like here， any tips on amusing。

 yourself while solo， is that really your big one， if it is， that's cool， but is that， your big one。

 you have one question that you can ask me right now， are you sure you。

 want to use any tips on amusing yourself solo， is that really the big one， the big thing。

 that's really holding you back， if there's one answer you could get， is it that， OK，， and again。

 it might be， and I'll just answer this now because it makes me think of something。

 I saw on the Facebook group too， it's like， how do you amuse yourself in your solo，。

 like do you just laugh alone and just to make it clear here， self amusement solo， OK，。

 and this is why I call it a law， make yourself feel good， more so than self amuse， is。

 you're not just standing there like a weird clown laughing out loud by yourself， OK， like，。

 when I go out by myself， I'm not just like， like clapping my hands and laughing and everyone's。

 like， what the fuck， and I'm like， I'm self amusing by myself， self amusing solo，。

 you're feeling good by yourself， it just needs feeling good inside， like again， the， whole like。

 it's OK， you know， maybe me feeling good solo is just kind of me just standing， there。

 maybe kind of bob in my head with a bit of a smile， just like， that's it， you， know。

 the whole idea is make yourself feel good， give yourself the result， you're hoping，。

 again when you're in a lower state of mind， the girl will give you， as long as you're， like。

 all is good， that's it， it's not clapping， clapping， self amuse， clapping， clapping，， little clown。

 little clown， no， it's just like， all is good， hey， how's it going，， versus I need something。

 all is good， I feel good， you know， and you can have some， little sayings， you know。

 you can tell yourself like， Alex， OK， he used to work with RSD，， he would just say， good Alex。

 all the time， that would be like one little saying that。

 would just kind of get him in that good mood， where whatever he was doing， he's like，， good Alex。

 good， just that， you know， he's in a club， he orders a drink， like， oh，， here's a me go drink。

 good Alex， good， good drink， you know， he would say， hide someone， like， good Alex。

 you do a little edit， good Alex， you can do that， you know， a little， saying。

 but doesn't have to be like over the top weird， stand out， you know， use common， sense， obviously。

 I find it very hard to speak with someone in the metro， for example，， if I plan to do day game。

 I'll go to a public place， like a mall or something， it's fine，。

 but just randomly in the metro or bus， I find myself getting stifled。， Why is that？。

 And what would you recommend？， Now， once again， is that really your number one question you want to ask me？

， Is that really the one thing that's missing？， OK， because I can guarantee you here。

 although you may think it is， OK， maybe not， maybe， you're like， oh， fuck。

 I shouldn't have asked that， but you may think it is， that's， not your number one fucking question。

 dude。， You know， it's like， you know， think of where you're already doing well， it's like，。

 how can you be doing better versus， well， what about this one situation on the metro？。

 I just feel a little bit more stifled on the metro。， Why？， That's your question。， Like， again。

 anything here you want to ask me， you can， but for you， it's just like， this one little situation。。

 That's like me saying， you know what， I have an awesome blast， I kill it， except if。

 I go to a bookstore， how do I do that？， Fuck the bookstore， just focus on where you're doing well。

 like， do you need， like， on， one hand， and I'll answer this， but on one hand。

 do you need to always be opening， on the bus or metro？， If you just feel a little bit more stifled。

 one， you could just get more references and， realize it doesn't matter。

 because that's really what it is。， Like， it's just in your head， like， oh。

 people will stare at me more， it's a lot more， social pressure。

 so just progressively desensitize yourself to it， or just don't game， on the metro or bus。。

 That's it。， Like， why do you need the game on the metro or bus？。

 If you're doing fine during the day， go elsewhere。， You know， like， again， it has to be a mix， like。

 if it's someone who's not going， out， who says， I go， I just don't feel comfortable， it's like。

 shut the fuck up， do it。， For you， if you're already doing well at day game。

 you can shut the fuck up， do it， for the bus or train， or just don't do it。， You know， for me。

 there are different venues， like maybe some bars around here， I don't， like， I don't go there。。

 That's fine。， Okay。， But again， you got to be careful if it's an excuse， like， oh， I don't like it。

 because， it's scary。， It's like， no， in that case， you have to expand。， Um， we're not。

 but if you're already killing it during the day， it's like， you don't。

 need to master the bus or metro。， And if not， if you do， like， the answer， and this is why it's。

 again， it kind of baffles， me。， This is like your number one question is， um， why？。

 Because there's a lot more social pressure， you'll stand out。， And how， what do you recommend？。

 Repetition， progressively sensitization。， That's it。， Those are the two things that。

 that's your number one question。， Next on， a number one sticking point is that I waste time。。

 I don't make the most out of my game sessions。， I go out mostly and spend 30 to 40 minutes before doing my first approach。

， I end up approaching， yes， but I weigh relatively long before starting day or night，。

 both situation have this problem。， Okay， so this one here， um， well， first of all。

 don't beat yourself up because of it。， Okay， it's like in that obsession with the negative。。

 This is like a guy who， you know， you could go out right now and like pull your perfect， 10。。

 But because you didn't maximize the first 30 minutes， you're going to beat yourself， up。。

 So be careful there。， It's like， yeah， you can fix this so you don't keep wasting all that time。。

 Obviously， but don't think that， you know， your game is shit and you suck because you。

 take 30 to 45 minutes before doing your first approach。， You know， of course not。。

 That's like someone who's like， I need to warm up before approaching。。

 I need to warm up and wasting time warming up。， It's like， no， it's like think bigger picture。。

 The whole night's one big set。， It's fine。， You know， if you get your girl at the end。

 who gives a shit about this 30 to 40 minutes， wasted？， Okay。。

 So if you do want to fix it and you should， the easiest way is get a wing。， You know， it's like。

 do you have a wing？， If not， get one， join one of the Facebook groups and give your wing cash。。

 Do like the old school technique。， Here's 100 bucks。， For every open， I get 10 back。。

 Or in your case， here's 100 bucks。， If I don't open within the first 30 seconds， you keep them。。

 You're not going to waste 30 minutes。， Okay。， Or you can even tell your friend。

 like if you don't have a wing at all， see you live， in the middle of nowhere。， Tell your friend。

 don't tell him about game。， But say， hey， I'm doing this little social challenge。， I'm going out。。

 So text him when you go out and say， hey， I'm going to text you a picture of me and。

 a girl in the next five minutes。， If I don't， you keep the money。， And like you give them 100 bucks。

， And now it'll force you。， You have five minutes to do fucking open。

 get a picture and send it to your friend。， Or he keeps the 100 bucks。， You know。

 it's kind of getting creative that way。， Like learning how to create these situations where you just don't have a choice。

， Like that's a lot of accountability。， Okay。， Obviously not beating yourself up。

 amping up the positive。， But in terms of you kicking your own ass。

 it's think if you wanted to quote unquote， fuck yourself over， what would you do？， That's really it。

， If you wanted to throw yourself under the bus， what would you do？。

 Knowing obviously that you'll think that you threw yourself under the bus yet later。。

 If that makes sense。， Because the hard part there is it's not really the open。， It makes sense。。

 The hard part is giving the money to buddy and telling him about the picture。， It's like 30 seconds。

， Here's the money。， I'm going to send you a picture。， That's all you have to do。。

 And now you're in that situation where you don't have a choice。。

 That's the you throwing yourself under the bus。， It's giving him the fucking money。。

 So a lot of accountability is those little moments where you throw yourself under the， bus。。

 And it's usually a few seconds。， The hardest part is a few seconds。。

 It's like you give him the money and you're like， I'll thank myself later for this。。

 And now you're fuck。， Now there's no choice。， Now you're there。， So start thinking that way。。

 Whatever it is， it's like how can I create this situation where I don't have a choice？。

 How can I quote unquote throw myself under the bus and thank myself for it later？。

 I recently started trying to merge sets。， Awesome。， That's really good。。

 That's actually going to be the next mission that comes out tomorrow。。

 They help me get even more in state because of the abundance。， Yep。。

 Merging sets is like one of the cheat codes。， Like I do it all the time。。

 Like if you want to get yourself in that very nice fun social state， fast merge sets。。

 It's like you're there。， It's crazy。， However， and this is the question， when I merge in others。

 give me a judgmental look and， sentences for doing that。。

 How do I give myself and not let those looks affect me？， Well， first of all。

 they're probably always going to be a little bit of a look。， When I merge sets， like， hey。

 come here， my friend。， They're always like， kind of like confused。， Like， what？。

 Because no one fucking does that。， It's not bad。， Totally fine。， Just realize， hey。

 they're just not used to it。， You know， it's like if you open a girl during the day。

 99% of the time， you're always， going to get that look like in the beginning。， Like。

 what's going on？， Because no one fucking does that。， No one merges sets。， No one's like， hey。

 come eat this person。， They're like， what's going on？， So realize it's nothing bad against you。。

 One thing I'll do when I merge sets is with this， well， first of all， keep it super， fucking fun。。

 That'll help too。， If you keep it really fun， no one will question it because it's all part of the fun。

， You know， it's not like， so come eat my friend。， If you do that， you're gonna be like。

 what the fuck？， If you're like， hey， me my friend。， Like， very smooth， very fun。， They won't。

 it'll be all good and assertive。， That's the important part。， Fun plus assertive。， Okay。。

 So I'll like literally tell them， like， is there a little confused？， Like， what's going on？。

 It's fun， but what's going on？， I'll tell them what to do。， So if I like open a girl and I'm like。

 hey， come eat my girlfriend。， And I open another girl and introduce them to each other。。

 I'm literally telling both of them what to do because they're both me。， Like， what's going on？。

 Like， shake her hand。， Hey， I contact。， Okay， I literally coach girls when merging sets。

 the way I'll coach a student on bootcamp。， That's my friend。， It's like， hey， me， shake her hand。

 shake her hand。， This is my other friend， shake his hand。， This is my other friend。， Oh。

 and that's her。， Say hi。， This is， like， I'm like the boss。， I was with a smile。。

 Always adding to the fun， but I boss the fuck out of that。， I'm like， do this， do this， do this。

 do this， do this。， I'm a coach。， It's like， shake her hand。， Hey。

 don't be shake your hand with a smile。， Okay。， And then I also， you know。

 remember that the goal is not to make them stick and stay there， and talk for hours。。

 It's fine even if they walk off and split。， The goal is you just keep involving people into your fun。

 okay， to get that nice sense， of abundance。， And， you know。

 then you can just bounce between them all。， But it's fine if they just， you know。

 don't talk after and don't expect them to either。， You know。

 just because you merge and this is a mistake， I see a lot of guys do， they， merge。。

 And then they're like， woo， hands off。， Hoping the girls are just going to take over。， It's like。

 no， it's still your set。， Your set just got bigger， but you're still the fucking like。

 you move it forward。， Okay。， Um， so I would say that and then， um， yeah。

 it's like be assertive with a smile。， Don't half-ass it or you'll get weird looks too like， uh。

 and don't oversell it。， If you're like， oh， my friend， my friend， my friend， then it looks weird。。

 It's like， wait a minute， what's the catch？， Casual fun plus assertive。。

 And then it's still your set， lead， lead， lead。， Congruance and knife venues。

 I don't drink and honestly would rather be in bed。， Uh。

 I don't know what drinking has to do with it unless you're referring to energy levels，。

 following up with the bed part。， Um， might advice you if you want to go out at night， do a nap。

 you know， have a nap before， going out。， Uh， you can drink coffee before going out or just。

 you know， go out for a shorter amount， of time and then just slowly build your way up to it。。

 You know， when I first went out to my first club， uh， fuck， this is like 10 years ago now，。

 almost 10 years ago。， Um， I was scared， shillis。， I hated it。， I didn't talk to a single girl and。

 uh， I couldn't go home because I was waiting for the，， the way it was in Switzerland。

 I had a way for a train the next morning。， So I was just sitting there and I used to fucking loud speaker。

 um， just like my whole， body， you know， in your club。， It's like。

 and I just did that the whole night。， It was absolute hell。， And I was tired。。

 I didn't want to be there。， Um， I didn't drink either。， Uh， it was hell。， Okay。， But guess what？。

 I kept putting myself in the situations and I still didn't like it for a long period。

 of time and I'd still get exhausted。， I'd still get drained。。

 I'd still feel completely disconnected until I did it。， Again， progressive desensitization。。

 Until now it's your home。， So again， it's like here， you know， if you get really tired。

 do the obvious things，， like coffee， nap， or go out for a short， a period of time， uh。

 and then from there，， just start building your way up and embrace it。， You know， it's， uh， you know。

 if you're going to go out at night， make that commitment， beforehand and then just don't let。

 like this would be the other one， just don't let， those little， um。

 excuses like I'd rather be in bed， um， sneak in。， You know， it's like you're out， maximize the time。

， You're either going to go out and go all out or you're going to stay in， but make a， choice。。

 Don't stay in between where you're out， but you want to be in。， If you really want to be in。

 then just don't go out。， If you really want to go out， go out。

 but then shut the fuck up about wanting to be， in bed， you know， and trust me。

 you can learn to enjoy and then absolutely love clubs。， Okay。， Um， absolutely love them。。

 And I don't care like how old you are here。， So I'd rather be in bed。， You may be like 40， 50。

 even fucking 60。， Okay。， I have a client who's like 60 going to clubs， loving it。。

 You're never too old for a club。， So yeah， and take my word on it。， I hated clubs for， you know。

 the whole beginning。， I love them now。， I'm currently in college and approached girls on campus on a regular basis。

， What are your thoughts on burning sets to the ground with people I meet in college？。

 Do not do that。， Okay。， I mean， this is just very common sense。， If you're out in fucking college。

 why would you burn a set to the ground？， Well， you know， you're going to get a horrible reputation。。

 If you're doing a lot of approaches in college too， you're probably going to stand out。

 and get a better reputation。， And your college years are going to fucking suck。， Okay。， Do not。

 do not cold approach in college。， Okay。， The way this works is you go out and even cold approach that means cold approach strangers。

， Okay。， You go out to a club to a bar during the day where there are no social repercussions。

 on say your reputation， you know， unless you're very advanced。， If you're advanced。

 they all means killed in college。， But if you're new。

 you're obviously going to get those interactions where you run out， of things to say。

 those interactions where it's embarrassing， those interactions where， make a fool of yourself。。

 And guess what？， In college， those interactions， the word is going to fucking spread。。

 That's going to be a rep and you're done。， It's like， oh， there's that guy who， you know。

 is like super weird， runs out of things， to say， does he's uncalibrated things？。

 He isn't very socially aware and he talks to every fucking girl。， Horrible。， Okay。， Do not do that。。

 Go and get your references with strangers and then once you get a feel for it all， let， those。

 again， let the internal changes kind of naturally seep into your day-to-day college， life。， Okay。。

 That still means you can approach obviously in college， but play it safe and be very aware。

 of the reputational impact because， I mean， college dude， you know， reputation is huge。。

 You don't want to ruin that。， Okay。， It disapplices the social circle as well。， Okay。。

 Cold approach， strangers。， Let the changes naturally seep into your day-to-day life。。

 What books or book would you recommend to help you change your perspective？， Watch 10-game。。

 Where you looking for a book？， Don't get in this trap of looking for more and more information to conceptualize。

， 10-game， 10-game， 10-game， 10-game。， So now on that。。

 What is the best mindset to adopt before going out to loud clubs？， Play the tempo of the night。。

 Like that's a big one。， And in very loud clubs， depending on the layout。

 realize that you're not going to have， that long set in the loud parts of it。， You know。

 so if there's like maybe a little smoking area or an area that's quiet， in the。

 second part of the night， you can have that girl you commit to where you have that long。

 interaction。， Otherwise， in the loud club， there's not really that part two of the night。。

 It's pretty much part one and part three when everyone's leaving。。

 And this will especially happen too if it's like a big DJ or a concert or something。。

 Just expect a lot of short interactions just because it's loud and most people came。

 to actually see the DJ or the person playing and try to set up your leads， get some fucking。

 numbers so that part three of the night you can like walk a girl out and hopefully make。

 something happen or call your numbers but don't expect that long 45-minute to an hour。

 and a half set。， That's just not going to happen in those really loud venues unless there are some quiet。

 spots in it。， So locate those for sure。， When I gain girls， I feel a little anxious inside。。

 This is happening very often。， Did I sexually hook the girl？， Is she feeling attracted to me？。

 Sooner or later， I feel like I want to look cool in front of the girl so she can feel。

 attracted to me and I can take her number or pull her。， How can I let go of that outcome？。

 Stop thinking about game in the field。， Just don't allow those thoughts to enter your mind。。

 And dumb down the theory。， Like really dumb it down。， It's like what is， did she hook？。

 What is social hook point？， She's acknowledging your existence。， Like that first question。

 you have the answer。， She's acknowledging your existence， you've hooked。。

 She doesn't have to acknowledge your existence。， She doesn't have to listen to a fucking word you have to say。

， She doesn't have to look at you。， She doesn't even have to acknowledge that you exist。， If she is。

 even if she's not talking back， if she's looking at you like， there's。

 a person you have passed the social hook point。， What is the sexual hook point？， Does she care？。

 That's the sexual hook point。， It goes from， aha， that's really cool to， what？。

 And you can usually see it in the eyes， in the tonality of it。， Does she care？。

 Would she feel a little different， a little sad， maybe a little disappointed if I， just left？。

 If that's the case， you've sexually hooked the girl and she is getting attracted。。

 Anything beyond that is bonus。， That's it。， That's all you're looking for。。

 She's acknowledging my existence， social hook point。， Oh， she'd probably be a little sad if I left。。

 She looks like she cares。， She's there。， And caring， by the way， doesn't even mean talking。。

 Some girls just depending on how they express that， like they may be shy， they may be。

 a little bit introverted， they may just not talk a lot。， They may not know what the fuck to say。。

 They're still sexually hooked and getting attracted。， Okay， quite an attendant。， If she goes。

 mm-hmm， like that， you're good。， Okay， and then beyond that， anything else， like if she's like， oh。

 touching you and， laughing， all this stuff， that's all bonus。， You don't need all that。， Okay。

 that is all bonus。， So just lower， dumb it down。， And now you're good。， That's it。， Next time。

 I'll just take care of you。， And it's just 1%。， Depends on the girl。， They express it differently。。

 If you tell a joke to a thousand girls， they're not all going to laugh the same。。

 The same was showing attraction。， And then it's don't worry about it。， Okay， then it's like。

 I'm having fun。， Yeah， she's there。， She's probably caring。， She's having fun too。， Awesome。， Again。

 stay in your head， trying to conceptualize。， It's the worst thing when it comes to game。。

 Like that'll kill your progress。， It'll kill even what an interaction is。， You know。

 like the big reason， like guys have trouble having those longer interactions。

 where you're vibing is because they're thinking logical game。， You know， they're conceptualizing。。

 And you can survive like a first， you know， a few minutes conceptualizing。。

 That's when most people did back in the day with routines。。

 They do like these 5-10 minutes set of routines。， We're like， that conceptualizing。。

 But there's no actual emotional connection。， And there's no vibing。， And if you're just thinking。

 next step， next step， next step， those 45 minutes， you're， like， what's next？， What's next？。

 You're going to freak out。， Those 45 minutes， like that's where you got to really。

 like to hold that long， set， you got to get 100% out of your head。， You can't otherwise。， You know。

 it's like the feeling that you should have when you have that long 45 minutes。

 an hour and a half set is the same feeling you have when you're just hanging out with。

 a really good fucking friend。， You know， it's like if you have like a really close friend and。

 you know， let's just， paint the picture here。， Say you have a really close friend。。

 You go out one night and， you know， like the typical American thing here is like，， you know。

 you have a couple beers。， Have a couple beers with your friend。， You're sitting down。。

 You're just talking about life and shit。， Now， you might have dinner。

 a couple of drinks just trying to about life， just really， vibing。。

 I highly doubt you're in your head thinking about all the little details。， Like， oh， am I， am I。

 you know， are we in the vibing stage now？， Is it my turn to talk？， Are we to do？。

 What did we cover so far？， You're not conceptualizing shit。， You're just there in the moment。。

 And that's what makes the dinner or the drinks fun and worth it with the person。。

 That's kind of like the mental state you should be in。， Okay。， So， you know。

 I'm going to be here with girls and it's even better with girls because， it's a fucking girl。。

 But that's it。， It's like， when I have those long sets of girls I pull， it doesn't like one， I'm。

 not in my head at all。， And two， it doesn't feel like she's a stranger at all。， And actually this。

 this little nuance here is this huge for those long sets。， It doesn't feel like she's a stranger。。

 It feels like we've known each other for fucking ever and it feels like we're just sharing。

 our lives with each other， just having an awesome like really deep personal， you know，。

 conversation。， And it's not deep personal in terms of we have to get super serious。。

 Most of the time it's us just laughing back and forth。， You know， it's not serious at all。

 but emotionally it's like that。， It's like two really good friends like we know each other for a while for a very long。

 time。， It's not like we just met at all。， And then that just kind of gravitates towards sex。。

 But to reach that， like you got to turn off that， you know， you're thinking mind。， And there are。

 of course there are many ways of doing that。， You can take a lot of action to point where you don't think。

， My advice is like kind of dumb it down， focus on like the fundamentals like， okay， does， she care？。

 Boom， yes， done。， And then just don't like set up that personal boundary。。

 Like don't allow those thoughts to your mind。， That's it。， You know。

 don't because it's the more you do it， the more it becomes a habit。。

 And then the harder it's to let go of it， you know， and you have to decide right now，， done。。

 You know， stop overthinking shit。， And this is in the field， but it's also out of the field。。

 You know， of course you have to break down your nights。， You have to get the lessons out of it。。

 And if you're just like always thinking， always thinking， always thinking， like the。

 guys obsessed about game， those are the guys who just can't get those long sets，， who can't vibe。

 who can't get those emotional connections with girls。， There's just no death to them， you know。

 and you can know all the theory。， You can know even all the right moves。。

 There's just no fucking death because you're not fully there。。

 You're in your head viewing reality through all these concepts， little rants on that。。

 I guess not many people asking that many questions， so it's fine， but do it。。

 It's like these questions， like， if I was， like， here's another， like， just a hammer。

 on even more here。， If I was asking myself all the questions， you're asking right now。

 I wouldn't be successful， with women。， Okay。， Again， if I was just sitting like， okay， well。

 how do I open her？， She's on the phone。， But how do I open her if she's with a friend or friends during the day？

， What about this？， What about this？， What about this？， Like， thinking like this shit。

 like thinking about all those little details that just， don't matter at all。

 and they just really take care of themselves。， Like， you go up， if a girl's her friend， of course。

 acknowledge her friend。， Why the fuck would you ignore her friend？， You know， it's like。

 how would you act if you're with a friend and someone comes and。

 opens your friend and just ignores the fuck out of you？， You'd be like， well， fuck this。。

 It's not a win-win。， Of course， acknowledge the fucking friend。， Obviously。， Okay。。

 But these little details， like， it kind of takes care of itself。， Like， you go and， hey， hey。

 don't think so much。， Do more。， Again， get those references during the day。。

 If you're actually going out during the day， you would know very fast that you have to。

 acknowledge the friend because every time you don't， you'll get rejected。， Okay。。

 But thinking about this without taking action about all the little details， that's what's。

 going to fuck you up。， Is it right to understand that you can't be unattractive if you are coming from a place。

 of being and are unreactive？， Is there a cure？， Is there a cure？， Somehow socially calibrated？。

 Seen from a living luxury standpoint？， Yeah。， I mean。

 those are traits that are definitely attractive。， However， don't think in terms of。

 you can't be unattractive。， Because like， again， what's the place that's coming from？。

 It's either you're just trying to make everyone like you。， And that's just thinking that way。

 that's going to prevent you from actually being， unreactive and being grounded。。

 So the solution here for you is don't aim to not ever be unattractive。， Okay。。

 And you are going to be unattractive to girls no matter what。， The way nature designs。

 you're not meant to like everybody。， Not everybody's meant to like you。， You know？。

 And the goal here is like， this is like a funny back game。。

 The goal is not to make everyone fucking like you。， The goal is to stop giving a fuck。。

 That's how you get there。， You know？， The more， and it's so funny。

 like someone was mentioning like John Lozwell， like the more， you just stop giving a fuck。

 the better you'll get at this。， But it's paradoxical。， And again， you got to see the new one says。

 people will hear this， like stop giving a， fuck and then they just won't care。， Like。

 why am I doing this？， Why am I even doing game？， Don't give a fuck。， But no。

 it's like there are times and there are different paradigms and different stages。

 where you need different things。， You know， in the beginning， I mean。

 obviously you have to give a fuck。， Obviously， you have to start field testing everything。。

 But once you pass that point where you're like so obsessed with these little details，。

 the next stage is stop giving a fuck about all the details。， That's how you get there。。

 Do I have to master the open， then the hook is on and so forth？， Nope。， And for poll。

 even if you're new， get out of social conditioning。， Okay， get out of this view that women hate sex。

， They love it。， You know， and they're hoping like a lot of those girls， and this is actually huge。。

 A lot of the girls you talk to are hoping for you to move things forward and create a。

 situation where they can feel comfortable taking things further as well。， Okay。

 they love sex and they're hoping for you to do it。， Okay， they're hoping for you like， hey， please。

 you know， let's take a look at this。， Take things further。， It's not like， oh， sex。

 or when you move things forward， oh， she's going to know I want， to fuck her。， It's like， no。

 it's fine。， Get out of social conditioning。， You know， the same with date， you know。

 a friend of mine actually was texting me a couple， of days ago。， So he's like， hey。

 I need help with this girl。， I'm trying to set up the day two。。

 And he's texting her to go on on this romantic beach date。， Okay， like a date on the beach。。

 And the first thing I tell him， okay， it sounds good。， It's like， oh， you know， date on the beach。。

 Awesome。， Sounds very romantic。， Am I dude？， First thing I tell him。

 why are you picking all these shitty day two locations？， Okay。。

 And there's nothing technically wrong with the beach， but logistically， and you have。

 to understand the day two this way， a day two is a continuation of the initial interaction。。

 It's not a date time where you go on this romantic thing。， The beach。

 he lives like fucking 45 minutes away from the beach。， It's a logistical nightmare。

 it's not smart to set up your fucking date there。， Okay。， And then he's like， well。

 maybe she lives in your bi。， It could always bounce to her place。， Like， what are her logistics？。

 Oh， she has a roommate that's kind of like cock blocky。， So you're not going to pull to her place。

 so why are you picking the beach？， Okay。， The best day two location is the bar that's closest to your bed。

， Okay。， Create logistics that are easier。， Like the reason you're seeing her again for day two is because you couldn't sleep。

 with her the first time。， So now you're picking things up where you left off to take things further with better。

 logistics。， Create better logistics。， And just in terms of socially conditioned beliefs here。

 he was like， oh， but that's boring。， That's that's boring。， Just drinks and then sex。， I'm like， no。

 dude， that's what the girl wants。， Okay。， And in terms of dates here。

 this is another just socially conditioned thing。， It's like。

 you have to realize like a girl really doesn't give a fuck about like the， fancy date or you know。

 the awesome plans。， Again， that's really cool to do them for you and technically I do this after sex。

， But what does she really want？， She wants to spend time with you and take things further and play to win。

 which is， playing for that sex。， Like sex。， That's what she loves。， And just hanging out with you。

 having drinks with you and then going to make her sex，， that's enough。， Just mean up the shitty bar。

， That's enough。， That's an awesome date for her。， Okay。， And not like one。

 thinking the contrary is like buying in social conditioning and what。

 is thinking the contrary reinforcing the fact that that's not enough。。

 So the fact that you're not enough。， If you think you need the fancy date。

 what does that say about you？， What's the assumption？， Oh， I'm totally boring otherwise。， Well。

 that's boring。， I'm a piece of shit otherwise。， I need the date to compensate for being a piece of shit。

， The date is the bribery。， No。， Okay。， So just， you know， kind of snap out of that。， Girls love sex。

， They love spending time with you。， They want to spend more time with you。。

 They want the interaction to move forward。， It's boring otherwise。， You know。

 if you just stagnate it。， It's completely boring and you'll see that。， Like usually。

 like not always， but sometimes there's like a window if you're on a date。

 for when you should kiss the girls。， Like the window， it makes， you know。

 now it makes sense to kiss her。， If you don't kiss her， you watch。， You will see girls very fast。。

 Just lose attraction。， Okay。， I experienced this when I first started out。。

 Like I was too scared to kiss and the girls was there and I'm like， I just want to kiss。。

 And maybe after like 10 minutes， 20 minutes， they're like， oh， he's not going to kiss， me。。

 And they would just lose attraction and someone getting even a little pissed frustrated。。

 They never see me again。， You may even experience this when you're out。， When you， you。

 instead of going for the pull， you get that fucking number at the end， of the night。， They're like。

 oh， I thought we were going to take things for the， oh， he's asking for， the number。， Mom， mom， mom。

， Okay。， So some， some things to keep in mind in terms of moving things forward。。

 How does one pull on the day two？， The same as the day one。。

 That actually goes hand in hand with what I was talking about before。。

 Don't view the day two as it's day two now。， Day two is， oh， imagine， you know。

 imagine there was not even a day two。， Imagine the day two is like back to the first time you met。。

 Okay。， What do I do on a day two？， One， set up logistics。， They're in your favor。， When you see her。

 never expect her to pick up where you left off emotionally， but，， you know， in the interaction， yes。

， But emotionally， you don't， you know， just because you were making out， doesn't mean。

 you're going to open with a fucking makeup。， She's feeling very differently。， So open again。。

 I would get a feel where she's at。， Boom。， Have a seat。， You do logistics that are now easier。。

 And then the same process of pulling baby step her back to your place or her place。

 or where you're going to take things further。， But that's a day two。， It's not date time。。

 If I do an amazing date， she'll fuck me。， It's， oh。

 continuation of the initial interaction with better logistics。， That's a day two。。

 How to convince myself to emotionally invest in closing。， Like。

 how can you assess how I should close？， It's not so much convince myself I need to close。。

 It's find the fear in terms of why you're not closing。， Okay。

 because the way an interaction works is it kind of just blossoms into sex。， You know。

 it's like we're having fun， fun， fun， fun。， Eventually you reach that point where what's more fun sex？

， It's not you necessarily need to do anything。， It's like if you just don't not do。

 it's going to blossom into sex。， So there's some fears somewhere where you kind of stagnate it。。

 It's like if the window of kissing is there for me back in the day， there was fear。。

 I didn't go for the kiss。， It's not about convincing myself I need to go for the kiss。， It's okay。

 where is the fear and how can I get rid of that？， Where's the blockage？。

 There are some girls who do not want to fuck until the fifth date。。

 Do you always have sex to know someone？， Do you always have to have sex to know someone？， Yeah。

 I mean， with that there。， Yeah， there are some girls。， Yeah。

 we're not going to fuck you till literally at the fifth date。。

 What I'd say there is I'd have to see the situation。， Like again。

 every interaction is fucking unique。， It could be that you're kind of chubby or you fuck some shit up or she's just not that。

 into you。， It could just be you。， And if it was some other guy， she'd fuck him a lot sooner。。

 But it could also be that you're doing everything fucking right and that's just the girl。。

 There are some girls。， You do everything right。， They're not going to fuck you that same night。。

 There's just like no one I'd stand no matter what。。

 Your game's sound tendency is like no one I stands。， Some other girls， yeah。

 it's like they're like no， just you know， X amount of dates。， You know， it's like I'm not like that。

， Maybe they'll fool around。， They're not going to fuck you。， And you know。

 as long as it's not every girl or then it's for sure something you're， doing that's wrong。。

 But every once in a while you'll get those quote unquote flukes。， Yeah， don't freak out。。

 It's like and just ask yourself like it doesn't mean it's over。。

 It doesn't mean necessarily you're like， oh， I'm a trod now。， It's how much do you like the girl？。

 Do you like her enough to go on all these dates before sleeping with her？， And if so， go for it。。

 You know， there's one girl I did back in the day where yeah， it took four dates， four。

 dates until we had sex。， I just really liked her a lot。， So I was like， yeah， fuck it。。

 I don't mind。， How are you going for day two's？， Yeah， I mean， yeah， it's like understand。。

 It's like a one night stand， like for a one night stand to work and there's a lot of， hype again。。

 The way it always works that I talk about this in 10 game is aim for sex。， Don't delay things。。

 Don't make things more complicated than they need be。， The girl wants to spend time with you。

 build the interaction together and then climax， into sex。。

 So if the possibility for that climax is there， why are you setting up a fucking day， two？， Okay。。

 Now， due to logistics， however， due to the time of the night， due to all these other。

 circumstances and due to the girls too， like some girls again， they're not down to， fuck that night。

 you're not going to be able to blossom into sex during the initial， meet。， So， in the end。

 the case set up the day two and for sure go for the day two。， Otherwise。

 you're going to miss out on a lot， a lot of opportunities。， A lot of hype about club game。， Yeah。

 the reason there's just a lot of hype about like the big benefits of like going， into a club。

 say versus the day is one， there's a lot of social pressure。， Now there's a lot of pressure in both。

 but it's different。， You know， it's like during the day， it's more chill。， You'll stand out more。。

 So people judging you， that's a little bit higher。， However。

 it's a lot easier in terms of the interaction itself during the day。， Right。

 there's a lot of social pressure because there's just so much shit， you know，， like so much chaos。。

 And you're also like competing against， you know， like for the girls' attention， like。

 there's all the music， the dance floor， it's just a lot more chaotic。， It's like you're， you know。

 instead of swimming in the swimming pool， like you're in the， fucking ocean in a storm。， So that。

 like you'll learn very fast from fucking grounded。， So huge benefits there。。

 And the other big one is there's a lot of girls。， There's a lot of opportunities to give reference experiences versus wasting time。

， you know， walking around during the day to just get like three opens done， you know。。

 So you'll get a lot faster going where the girls are。， Now。

 that doesn't mean clubs necessarily better than the day either。， Like if there's， if you live in。

 you know， say there's like a festival during the day， and there's a lot of girls。

 then fucking go there because there's a lot of girls。， It's basically where are the girls go there？。

 What's the one thing that I was motivated me to keep going out and gaming on the beginning。

 of the journey？， For me， it was freedom， actually。， Yeah， it's， I talk about this。， Yeah， I mean。

 it was for me， it was that first， the first open， you know， that first， open that I did。

 it was like a sense of freedom， like literally all those years kind of， leading up to it。

 or I just kept kind of， you know， suppressing who I was。， Boom， I could finally。

 it was like I finally broke free with that first open。， So that feeling there。

 that's what got me hooked， you know， and as soon as I experienced， that， I'm like， whoa。

 and as soon as I even physically proved myself， hey， I can do， this。， You've done it once。。

 There's no reason you can't do it again。， That's what got me hooked。。

 And I didn't care how long it would take。， I didn't care what it would take。。

 I didn't want to live a life where， you know， I wasn't free。， So that's really what got me hooked。。

 And that's what motivated me even to this day。， For me， it's all， yeah。

 being able to put yourself out there， get out of conditioning，， get out of the fucking shackles。

 you know， of a society or the shackles you impose on， yourself and be free。， It sounds so cheesy。

 like be free， but that's really it。， You know， it's like that。。

 That feeling most of us have when we have to like sing in public， you know， it's like， you。

 you kind of freeze， you're like， well， maybe you can't do it。， That feeling there， that。

 that's what I had， not just with singing， but in every，， you know， area of life。， I was like。

 I was always， like， I just couldn't。， It's like， I wanted to， I just couldn't， you know， it's like。

 you know how to sing，， you just can't。， I knew I wanted to partake in life。， It's cheesy。

 it sounds like I'm with friends。， I want to fucking say something。， I want to be part of it。。

 And I just couldn't， and that was my whole life。， There's like， there's， I just couldn't do it。。

 And reading， you know， finding out about the game and reading the book， the game was， like。

 the first thing was like， holy shit， I can do something about this。， Because I was ready to be like。

 well， that's just who I am。， Fuck it， you know， that's life。， So it just feels like shit。

 I can do something about this。， And then， you know， it took like， yeah。

 a couple of months of me just going out where， I still couldn't do that。， And then that first open。

 it was like， it was like such a high and such a relief， you， know， like comparing it to singing。。

 So I can't sing， it's like you finally do。， You just get hooked， you want more and more of it。。

 So for me it was like shit， I kind of had that glimpse of breaking through on the other， side。。

 And that's what got me hooked。， And in terms of motivation， like， of course。

 there are times where you want to kind of，， you know， whip yourself in the shape。。

 But most of the time it's just like， I'm just focusing on that。， That's what got me there。。

 You know， focusing on the positive， focusing on what game is。。

 What would you ask if you were us right now， seriously？， To be honest。

 like if I went back like two to， I like that question。， What would you ask if you were us right now？

， It depends on which part of the journey I'm in。， If it was in the very beginning。

 in terms of accountability， motivation， I would probably， ask like， hey。

 I have a theory like this is me， say before that first open， I have， the theory。。

 I've been going out， I'm literally roaming the fucking streets。， I just can't do a fucking open。。

 What do I do？， Do you have any advice？， You know， and this is， you know。

 where the advice like get a fucking wing， which I did。， Get a wing， try to babysit your way there。。

 Make that situation where you don't have a choice。， Give money to your wing。

 give money to a fucking friend。， Do whatever the fuck it takes。。

 That's the advice that I would give。， That's where all this comes from。， Then later on。

 I'd probably focus on if I had a huge sticking point， kind of what I。

 said in the beginning of this call， if whatever my sticking point was， if it's just。

 one where I'm really banging my head against the wall， I'd be sure to ask that question。。

 And then later， I'd probably ask， yeah， kind of just more personal questions， you know，。

 about the person。， I'd want to see more behind the scenes。

 more so than any specific content question。， I just want to get a vibe of the person。， Yeah。。

 That's mainly in a way what I do now， you know， if I meet anyone， I don't really talk。

 like specific content。， Like most specific content questions， you can find like in a product。

 you know， like， here we explored， of course， a lot of other things。， But， you know。

 technically if you actually dug through 10 games， you could find the answer， to your questions。。

 So I'd just mainly get a feel for the vibe， you know， just kind of try to vibe with， the person。

 be like， ah， you know， and just kind of get some more on the emotional， layer。， Yeah。

 I like that question though。， But that's what I'd say。， Yeah， bringing down your nights。

 I would say make it sustainable。， So you should always。

 I'd recommend always breaking down every single time you go out。， By the way。

 like write down some notes。， If you have like a journal。

 like that's why I keep saying posted in the Facebook group， if you're following the missions。。

 I'd recommend doing it every single time。， Now， I'd say the basic one。

 I make guys do this on bootcamp and I talk about this in， shift is three sets。

 three lessons and you can even add three things you said or did， you found funny。， Three sets。

 three lessons， three things you said or did you found funny。， You know， this will， three sets。

 it could be a good one or bad one， the three main ones， that stood out and why。， Three lessons。

 you know， that's like， oh， I learned this， I learned I should do this。。

 Three things you said or did you found funny。， And what's cool with this format is so you go out seven days straight。

 if you write， down three lessons every single day， you know。

 some of the days the lesson is going to， be the same， you know。

 and the lesson that stands out the most， that's your big sticking， point。

 fix it and then keep going that way there。， So I do that technically， you know。

 if you have more time， do more than three， but I like， the three because even if you're busy。

 like it takes fucking five minutes， you know，， five minutes， like write it out。

 just gives you kind of reflecting on the session。， So I'd say do that one there。。

 How long do I usually take？， Again， depends， if I've time， I'll write it down in depth。， Otherwise。

 it could just be like literally a few notes on my phone， you know， it depends，。

 just make it sustainable。， There's one thing you live by in a game like you're enough。

 what would it be？， Fuck， there's many， man。， There's 10。， There's one thing you live by in the game。

， It's 10。， It's the 10 laws。， Live by that。， Live by those。， And overall， like again。

 it's so cheesy， but and we kind of talked about this in the， beginning， it's all good。。

 Like that little mantra， it's all good。， We'll get you ahead big time， you know。。

 If you think about it too， like it's all good， if you can actually think of everything。

 as being all good， you would still take action。， It'd be tough to kind of rationalize your way out of it。

 because you'd be like， oh，， like， because what's preventing you from taking action？。

 It could be like fear。， I go， I'm scared about people think it's all good。， Oh， okay。

 then you do it。， So it's all good。， Whatever you're at， like next time you're out。

 remember this call， next time you're， fucking freaking out or something， it's all good。。

 The last thing I just say here， and I heard this somewhere， forgot where it was， if。

 you think about， like kind of just ending on an inspirational note， again， next time。

 you're freaking out， just remember the all good。， And the other one is the， you know。

 your biggest regret， if you think about it， no， matter how bad things could get。

 like in terms of you say getting rejected， you're， going to destroy it。

 the biggest regret you should have is not doing this。， So as long as you're doing this。

 as long as you're moving in the right direction，， you're all good， you know， and then keep it fun。。

 Okay， it's like you've got a view like the different， like， paradigms to this， where。

 it's like you got a hustle， but overall keep it fun。， You know， it's like here。

 we're kind of diving into different aspects of game， we're， diving into motivation， like， you know。

 be very serious， break down your nights， but don't， get so sucked into all of this。。

 As we talked about in the beginning， we start overthinking and they'll get so sucked， into this。

 the game becomes such a big deal。， Remember， it's all good。， Okay， just going out， having fun。

 chatting girls， having to blast， having those epic moments，， enjoying the freedom that is game。

 that's really what it's all about。， Like， never forget that big picture there。。

 That's what I can do with it。。
