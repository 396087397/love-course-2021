 Our Company had online marketing based upon fund， When we built our company。

We first started market our company with funny cartoon skits，like comic book strips。

If you look at things like Jeffie shows' product，I think it's jeffieshow。com。

You'll see a comic strip，Where Owen and I would be making fun，ofhow。

Jeffey's game is so tight in a comic strip，Where we were dressed up by docters in London。

主 cooked enterprises and，and analysing Jeffie always working out the gym，and he goes。

 Game skills are off the chart， He's on the treadmill， he's working out。

 and doing silly cartoons and what have you， This is before we started having videos。

 and we were posting out there， and a lot of this was based in the fact。

 that we wanted the culture that was based on fun， we wanted to market present our brand。

 as being an image that was fun， So our online marketing was based upon。

 the image and culture that we had within our organization。

 The cute nibbles of fun that we want to present，ude through，没有，venth，又，starring，ca， Ener，h，ỗi，平行，爆音。

 whenever there was a new kind of computer or TV or television came out， I would be on it。。

 I was taking a university computer science class， never since I was a kid。

 and I even know that Owen himself used to work for a very popular engineering firm。

 and was how he involved with computer networking and what have you， at a very young age。

 he could as an employee before he became an entrepreneur himself。。

 Now we're looking at developing everything from phone apps。， We used to have a phone app magazine。

 now we have a private label phone apps for membership groups。。

 We're looking at using new ways to connect to people。。

 We used to have a situation where we had phone call chains that would call people。

 on an automated basis and remind them to attend events or invite them to events in their cities。

 where we personally text and actually call with the mass voice call trees。

 or just call people with our voice， send out messages， talk to us and they can push the button。

 on the phone to be signing up for an event。， These are also the better services like this as well。。

 Now it's a little bit more difficult to sign up for some of our events。， If you try to do so。

 usually you have to have some kind of a valid credit card。

 so you get to verify that your identity and we know that you're not just some random。

 member of the press。， We used to have to do that for security purposes because we had some people。

 that were trying to get into our event to protest the hook up culture。

 and the stuff they were trying to progress we teach。。

 But now with new technologies and new ways of executing security with a market，。

 you're going to continue to see us innovate and take things to the next level。
