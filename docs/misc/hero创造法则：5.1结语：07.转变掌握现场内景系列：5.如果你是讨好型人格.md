 Please  '' it is all about them， There's never what about me， What about your needs？

 What about what's going on inside？， You're like fuck that。 Let's please them。

 If I meet someone and I want their approval， I must do whatever I can to please them and make them happy。

 It's all about them， I don't know if they'll like this joke， So let's hide that joke。

 So that little inner voice you have of authenticity， Let's just say you just keep ignoring it。

所以我在医生盛規對，你的城市收入，你的 原本就是，你的事就是，道理，然後又叫你不重要，問題是，你一退，說你不重要，我大不了，我比你更多，也Produce，初次，我的魏眼，第三个，所以你 잘못 life。

我心中堔игр， 해�ck，我就 turn off，其實是開了，嗯，OK， When did you open up what happened。

 We're going to dive in also more emotionally， Here a lot of it is just kind of letting those emotions come up。

 kind of tuning into what it is we need to process， But for now it's like let's just take an example。

 and you're probably going to experience a lot of resistance to this， But like hey。

 when's one time you can remember right now， Like you did open up and you were rejected。

 Because that's probably the same fear that's kind of coming up here。

 Because what am I making you do？， Literally open up in front of a fucking crowd。

 So now there's like oh my god if you do this， You're going to get rejected。

 You're going to get rejected， Where did that come from？。

 What was one previous experience where you did get rejected， And how did that feel？， Like replay it。

 put it out there and go through it， And I know this is like the hardest thing you could possibly do。

 But that's why you got to take the benefit of the pressure of the crowd。

 Where it's like no running away from it， And that's I just want to reinforce as well。

 As long as you keep running away from something similar to that abundance。

 It's going to keep staying there， And you're going to keep reinforcing it。

 And that's what's like really hard too， It's like step one like say you feel really really miserable。

 Really really like in pain， There's all these negative emotions。

 It's like yeah step one do whatever you can to get out of that， Again positivity challenge。

 Whatever the fuck is better than feeling just horrible， Like do it。

 But realize like it's still not the end goal， Because as long as you're like must be happy。

 Must feel good all the time， You're going to continuously keep escaping these other painful emotions。

 And it's only until you fully dive into them， And realize hey it's all good。

 So you can finally like feel abundance or feel at ease。

 And no longer feel this constant need of running away from running towards。

 So here it's like whatever you're running away from。

 Like this is usually the stuff that you even pop in when you're sitting home alone。

 It's like you say home it's like， It starts bubbling up。

 Let's dive into it and kind of use this environment to make yourself do it。

 So what's one example where you opened up and really got rejected。

 And it's just like really really hurt and it was really like traumatizing， I know it's hard I know。

 Just know that the crowd's there if you just want to focus on me， Just focus on me。

 I just can't come up with a concrete example really。

 Most likely a lot of those experiences were so you did open up， And you were rejected for it。

 You shoved them down， And most likely a lot of it happened when you were really young。

 But let's just say I don't know just think of the most recent one。

 Even if it's like a small scale one， Like did you ever go through a breakup when that happened？。

 Did you ever meet someone when that happened？， When was sometime it's like again always people pleasing。

 It's like you want to please everyone what's so bad if you don't please everyone。

 Because that's with people pleasing， It's like you're trying to always conform to the person you're talking to。

 And we all have it， It's like do you guys ever say yes when you want to say no？。

 So you're a people pleasing， And as I know it's like， So most likely it's like people pleasing。

 It's like you always want to fit in， And kind of link into people seeing the real you。

 When you are people pleasing they never do see the real you。

 They always see that front that you put on， And you can kind of experience it too。

 Like you'll see in different relationships， And this is something where if you use relationships in your benefit。

 It'll help big time， Because with people pleasing。

 You can fake it enough to kind of get in the beginning of a relationship。

 But for a relationship to really like blossom， You need to truly be authentic and put yourself out there。

 And once your partner kind of sees like you can't do that。

 There's still all these aspects that you hide， There's no longer that trust。

 There's no longer that intimacy， And in a way for the other person too， It becomes very boring。

 Because you're just a mirror of that person， So it'll keep blocking you from really connecting with someone authentically。

 But then there's that fear too， Well what if they do see the real you。

 What's so bad about them seeing the real you， What's so bad about them even rejecting the real you。

 Whatever comes to mind， Say I open up， And then the other person says like， No， that's okay。

 You shouldn't feel like that， Yeah， And I get a lot of that， Like for my family， And my siblings。

 And yeah， So shamed to feel what you're feeling， Yeah exactly。

 What are some of the emotions they don't want you to feel， Or they say you shouldn't feel like that。

 Like anxious or sad or angry， Here to what's interesting is。

 You know we think we would feel comforted， When someone tells you like hey you shouldn't feel bad。

 But in reality that makes things worse， You know just be aware of it next time。

 You're maybe with a friend or a loved one， And they're experiencing， Let's just say some sadness。

 And you're like you know what you shouldn't feel that bad， You shouldn't feel sad， It'll be okay。

 That's not what they want to hear， Because you're making them feel like， It's not okay to feel sad。

 In reality what we all crave， In a moment of sadness for example， Is someone to just be with us。

 You know， And to accept the fact that we're sad， And be with us with the sadness if you will。

 Versus labeling the sadness as bad， And making us feel wrong about feeling what we're feeling。

 It's more so it's okay to feel sad， It's okay to be feeling what you're feeling。

 And to be with you for that， Okay， So what happens if you do show anger or sadness。

 What are you feeling right now， Actually let's do this， This is a good little exercise。

 And we'll keep going deeper， Narrate what's going on in your head， Or emotionally just right now。

 Like we all have that little voice in our head， Step one in terms like say hey be in a real fuck it。

 Stop putting on the front， Is just starting narrating it。

 So literally whatever that voice is saying right now in your head， Like when I'm saying you're like。

 Oh fuck what is it making me like that， Verbalize it， Literally verbalize whatever is going on。

 Don't judge it， It could be like， Oh my god fuck Julian， Why did you bring me up on stage。

 I don't care what it is， Verbalize it， So I make her do that exercise of narrating。

 What's going on inside， Okay fuck the front， Fuck micromanaging， What you're saying。

 What's coming out， Get rid of all the filters and just say it， Because that's what happens。

 We think something we're like， Is this okay to say is it okay to express it？。

 Does it fit the front here？， No， Yes， Okay it's like there's this bar， Is this okay？， No， Yes。

 And the more， Let's just say extreme of a people please or you are， The higher the bar。

 All of this is not okay， Only this is okay， So what I'm doing here is let's get rid of this fucking bar。

 Just say whatever's on your mind right now， And use this as a stepping stone。

 To get one step closer to being authentic again， To remind you what it feels like。

 To be authentic and to stop having this little front， No I'm just。。。。

 When I get nervous I turn very red in my face and my chest， Do this for like two minutes。

 Do this for like two minutes， Do this for like two minutes and I think about。

 Your thing is on my right now， Yeah， Verbalize it for two minutes just verbalize it， Verbalize it。

 verbalize it， Verbalize the resistance to it， You're like oh no I can't。

 I feel like that if I verbalize it this， I'm trying to come up with excuses not to verbalize it。

 I'm trying to you know find， Talk my way out of it， whatever it is for， Verbalize that。

 I just feel like if people in the crowd have noticed it yet， And I say it or I feel it more。

 They see it， Okay I like it， And you're still talking and verbalizing a bit of it。

 But it's still kind of explaining it to the crowd， Make it really personal。

 Like that voice talking to you， Let it out， I feel awkward in a way I see it because I have all this knowledge of how to be like open in your body language。

 But I still see for my legs crossed and my arms crossed， That's funny enough that's being open。

 Yeah， It's talking about how you're afraid of like being open。

 It's like it's fine if you're crossed， Like you telling people you feel uncomfortable about。

 Well maybe I'm not open enough by being like this， That's you being open， So continue that。

 That little voice just start narrating it， Express it， I feel more comfortable right now。

 Right here， I want two minutes of it， Non-stop， Two minutes， We all have that little voice。

 Two minutes non-stop， If you don't know what to say verbalize。

 I don't really know what to say right now， Like whatever is going on。

 That's what you want to need to verbalize， I'm not very good at English so it feels kind of awkward sitting here。

 You're from love so you can keep on talking English， Good， This is so awkward， Good？ Keep going。

 It's making me nervous， Keep following， keep going， keep going， That's the step one。

 Now obviously you really want to resolve this subconsciously and emotionally。

 But step one for anyone who's stuck in this people-pleaser mentality， Which is most of us。

 It's doing something like this， It's just verbalizing what's on your mind。

 And I can guarantee you you just doing that， It hits everyone watching you on an authentic level。

 That's the shit where you're like， Whoa， you actually see the human side。

 It's no longer the front of like， Okay I'm here on stage， I'm doing the exercise， It's like， Whoa。

 And that's also when you connect with everyone on a deep level too。

 Because again the more personal the wound the more universal。

 Like does anyone actually kind of feel the same way。

 Where you're like oh shit like that's what kind of stood out， Yeah， You know。

 And we think it's the opposite， We think it's when we put on this cool front that people like us。

 And we always underestimate the value of authenticity。

 And the same in like just social interactions， If you're always going out and you're talking to people trying to put on this cool front。

 It's like yeah I mean it's better than not going out and interacting with people。

 And you're still not breaking out of this people pleaser mentality。

 Trying to be cool is being a people pleaser， Trying to be a bad boy is being a people pleaser。

 Trying to be a nice guy is a people pleaser， Stop trying to be so nice start being more real。

 And start getting actual reference experiences like you're getting now， Of you being real like this。

 Now of course you can even go deeper like okay what is real you know。

 But just start narrating authentically what's going on， If you run out of things to say。

 The best thing to do is hey I ran out of things to say。

 And you think oh the person won't like like mock you but in reality。

 There's that authenticity and that's really what's missing， It's like we all have this front。

 You know I can guarantee you too although oh my god， I'm nervous and you said I'm nervous。

 That felt a lot better than trying to hide the nervousness， You know。

 And that's kind of those first references you want to get where it's like it's okay。

 Because that's really what realizing you know it's like abundance is your default。

 It's real like it's fully it's the ultimate form of self acceptance。

 It's accepting who you are consciously and everything that's in your subconscious。

 Accepting and validating everything you went through and everything you're feeling。

 Whatever you're feeling if it's okay to feel that， It's good it'll just like move through you。

 The thing is like we're like this is bad this is bad this is bad。

 And we keep suppressing and hanging on to shit， No it's totally okay who says it's bad。

 You know so keep going， I know you thought it was over。

 What kicked in now you're like okay keep going， What thought came in what emotion came in。

 Nerry that when I said keep going， Just yeah， I don't feel nervous anymore it's quite nice， Yeah。

 Yeah， Yeah I don't know what to say， It's quite nice just being quiet， Oh this is awful。

 I don't like this， Here I did， Nerry why don't you like it？， I feel anxious， Good what else？。

 Feel surreal I'm just seeing your face green， Alright so we'll just do this as like level one。

 Okay we'll get a little deeper here， Again this is good it's a good exercise。

 But we still need to get to the original cause a lot of times in your subconscious。

 So close your eyes and literally think back to again one of those moments where。

 You know you were putting yourself out there authentically。

 And if you resonate with this you can do it too， Okay just like close your eyes and think back to one of those moments you put yourself out there。

 And you know someone just really shamed you for what you were feeling or shamed you for what you were thinking。

 You know they told you it was not okay， That part of you was rejected。

 You know you felt maybe embarrassed you felt upset。

 Maybe self hate kicked in cause you shouldn't be feeling that you're like what's wrong with me？。

 Why am I feeling that？ Why is that coming up， And just kind of replay the scenario。

 And just replay like all those sensations， Like how do you feel if you were anxious。

 if you were angry， Just kind of what came up， And what are you feeling your body right now just kind of replaying it。

 Do you feel hurt？， Betrayed？， Upset？， Embarrassed？， Stupid？， Hating yourself beating yourself up。

 Just tune into it and just let it come up， Okay， So it's just start bringing that awareness。

 That's the first step， Bring some awareness to what is down there。

 Okay and if a little bit comes up that's fine， You may experience resistance and nothing will come up in that case tune into the resistance。

 But just allow that to finally come up， Stop running away from it， stop ignoring it。

 stop distracting yourself， Use this as an opportunity to really dive into it， So again。

 it's then about using the inner approach to get to the cause and let go of it， Okay。

 but realize here that people pleasing is something that we all do， You know。

 we are all hooked on always putting on this front， And we all have to let go of it， Okay。

 and realize here too that you'll never get what you're hoping to give with this front。

 Like let's just say you're putting on a front to you know get a lot of approval。

 I mean who doesn't want approval， But what will happen is no matter how much approval you get on one hand。

 It will never fulfill you in a way because you're not really being approved for you。

 You're being approved for the front that you put on， You know。

 so there's part of you that knows they don't really like the real you， They only like the front。

 There's that saying what hurts more than being， say， rejected for you。

 Is only being liked when you're not being you， When you're being fake when you're putting on a front。

 And that's just the worst and not just that but even if you get all the approval。

 What then happens because it's you know external， It's in the world of duality and because someone who can approve of you can also disapprove of you。

 There's then that fear of keeping the approval， They're like okay， well they approve of me now。

 But will they still approve of me a second from now？， How do I keep them approving of me？。

 How do I keep them approving of me tomorrow？， Okay， it's endless。

 It's a perpetual chase you never get there， And again。

 you start as we mentioned before killing yourself a steam。

 You start hating yourself and you start hating others too。

 Because you're always putting on this front to please them。

 And as soon as they don't go that extra mile because you're going the extra mile。

 You're like a fuck that person， fuck that person， and then you tell yourself。

 I can't be feeling this， suppress it and there's this passive aggressive type of vibe to you。

 And this is why people just explode because they keep suppressing it， So let go of it。

 realize to you that no connections that you build with other people will ever be authentic。

 And that sense that too， I said here， it's like when you get into a relationship for it to really last the long run。

 You have to drop this fucking front， Otherwise， I mean it won't go anywhere because there's no intimacy。

 People don't get to know you， but you always agreeing。

 You think you're doing someone a favor like I'm always agreeing with them， whatever they like。

 But in reality， you just become this mirror of who they are， And that's not interesting。

 they'll lose， I mean interest very fast， Because no one wants to date themselves or just。

 for example， or marry themselves， And they never get to know you that like。

 well who's the real person underneath？， No one wants someone who's agreeable。

 People want someone who is real， Otherwise， again。

 you're just boring and it's extremely lonely for the other person。

 There's no trust and I mean everyone loses， They don't get to know you， resentment kind of kicks in。

 they're like， they can't trust you， Because of that。

 you already hate yourself and then you resent them and should just hits the fan， So people pleasing。

 it's horrible， like all of it， fuck the fake front， Even if it's a nice fake front。

 fuck that nice fake front。
