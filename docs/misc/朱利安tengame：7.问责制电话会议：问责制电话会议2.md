aments Fasting 等級器，而第幾隻，emple 2 我 respite，更彥者， lettingo之類，既然這個遊戲，效果有到，"？，旷子，這挺好，ρο。

 next step next step next step， let go of that，ok， we're still in the real world， don't devalue just。

 vibing for the sake of， vibing， ok， another thing I notice here is， you know， a lot of clients。

 don't， embody and buy into themselves， like they don't embody the number one guy。

 and they don't buy into themselves at all， ok， so what does this mean， you know if you want to be。

 literally， like if you want to kind of reach this state of。

 like hey I can relax and actually get the girl， you have to be the number one guy。

 you have to believe deep down inside， you're the number one guy。

 you are the best option in the world for this girl， ok， me right now if you ask me straight up。

 are you the best option for any girl in the world， yes， the answer is yes。

 you could attach me right now to a， fucking lie detector， no hesitation。

 like are you the best option， like better than anyone， any fucking millionaires。

 celebrity anyone in the world， are you the best option for the world。

 you're the best option for every single girl in the world， yup， straight up。

 and I do believe it 100%， ok， for you， to kind of， graduate。

 we can even call this level three to kind of graduate， you need to start believing that too。

 with full conviction that you are the best， option for every fucking girl。

 that you are the number one guy， ok， because on one hand， girls， ok we'll go for nothing less。

 most of the time where the girls you want， like they want the number one guy， every girl goes out。

 hoping to meet the number one guy， that's the only reason a girl goes out。

 you know if you take a couple seconds to think about it， no girl goes out to meet more friends。

 no girl goes out to meet more nice polite people， every fucking girl goes out to meet that number one guy。

 and every time a guy approaches her， she's hoping deep down inside， she's on your side。

 she's like please be the number one guy， are you going to be the number one guy， oh no， ok。

 they're all looking for it， and you know unless you embody， you're not going to get them。

 and unless you embody it too， you're always going to feel like， you know deep down inside。

 like you're going to want her to go for someone else， like you're not going to want her for you。

 because you're going to feel guilty， because you're kind of fucking over。

 from missing out on a better option， you know if you're not number one。

 and there's that means there's another number one， you would want her to go for， for him， you know。

 you wouldn't want her to go for number two， you'd hope the best for her。

 you know so that's going to prevent you big time， from you know getting the results you want。

 so you got to start embodying that， ok， you got to be your own hero， that also means stop you know。

 coming from this frame where you're， you're placing other people on a pedestal。

 like even in terms of pickup， you know you might hear there's a certain context， or I'm the teacher。

 you know you're following my advice， but you kind of reach that point。

 where if you really want to you know， grow and again this is level three。

 there's you need different things， wherever you're at， but at level three you got to move past that。

 you got to stop viewing me， is even being like the teacher above you， you know。

 that doesn't mean don't be inspired， by other people， of course be inspired by other people。

 but start buying into yourself， be inspired， don't think you're beneath anyone else。

 and you got to graduate to that level， if you want the results you want， you know。

 this is like day three of every fucking boot camp， I'm telling you guys like。

 you better assume you're number one， you better know you're number one。

 I don't want this to be like， instructor student relationship， anymore it's like right now you've。

 passed me you've surpassed me you know， if there's a girl and say I'm talking to her。

 I want you to come up and be like， hey you know like cut over me， of course there's a balance。

 like if you want to listen to me talk， that's cool， but cut over me go for it。

 you're the best option， why wouldn't you， okay you letting her go for anyone else。

 is fucking her over， because you're literally the best option， okay。

 so you kind of have to buy into that frame here， and by best option by the way。

 the way I mean my my metrics， for like calculating this， are just awesome vibe。

 okay or your uniqueness， as soon as you understand that， okay law one。

 you know you can start cultivating it， don't base it on money， or anything like that， okay。

 your uniqueness， you know it's like， who are you some questions ask， who are you。

 you know you can't even， go superficial， just some stuff like， what are you proud of。

 a question every fucking guy， should ask themselves， like right now if I， like I'm asking you。

 what are you proud of， if you don't know， if you're like， I don't know， he nuts like。

 how the fuck do you want to buy into， to you， how can you believe， you're the number one guy。

 how can you believe， you're the hero， if there's literally nothing， you're fucking proud of。

 what are you excited about right now， you know what drives you， what are you passionate about。

 what turns you on， do you know， if it's nothing， then again， how do you want the girl。

 to be excited about， spending time with you， being with you， okay， that stuff you just。

 got to start fixing， you know it's in your day-to-day life， it's like， what are you proud of。

 and lower the bar， it doesn't have to be， this crazy thing， like oh you know I've， I went to space。

 type of thing， it doesn't have to be all that， it's like， what are you proud of， you should know。

 like no hesitation this， what are you excited about， this， okay it should be， just fast and again。

 there should be that， conviction behind it， okay， take some you know， learn to be a little bit。

 more self-aware as well， if you're going through， for example the Facebook， group okay。

 10 game Facebook group， which is fucking amazing， but take some perspective。

 and look at your comments， look at your posts， and view them， from someone else's perspective。

 you know say， you didn't know， you were reading， your own comments， and posts。

 and you assume about that person， you know， would you assume that person， is a cool person。

 you assume that person is number one， or not， you know， and right now you can immediately。

 catch yourself， if you're posting like， why any comments， if you're posting negative comments。

 if you're posting dumb questions， or just like， you know， worthless trolling， and shit。

 not saying that there is that， but you know say you are， from an outsider's perspective， again。

 what are you reinforcing， you're that type of guy， so take perspective， objective。

 leave you with the fuck you're doing， and start changing the habits， okay start， embodying。

 being number one， start embodying， being the guy who's again， it's like。

 you're the cool offering value type of guy， you're not the number two， you're not number three。

 you're not in the background， so I'm trying to get the pity fuck， you know that， that was me when I。

 before game， you know， I was never the number one guy， and my， very small group of friends。

 and I remember I was thinking， like， the only option to really get a girl， would be to you know。

 get a friend who's like， cool， so he'd get， the hot girl， and I could maybe get a friend。

 because I'm just like the number two， you know， it's like the pity late。

 it's like fuck the pity late， you want the girl be the number one， okay， and this is inset。

 out of set， this is not just well out， you know， 24 fucking seven， embody that guy。

 start buying into yourself， start getting cited， about who you are， and start cultivating。

 more and more of that， awesomeness， and the other thing here too， is it sounds pretty bad。

 I call it the， me first mentality， where it's， prioritized how you feel， above all else， you know。

 while out， it's stop compromising， what's going on inside， be sure to be doing those， check-ups。

 all throughout the night， or day， it's like， okay how am I feeling， me first， how am I feeling。

 because if you're not feeling good， she's not going to feel good， okay。

 and stop compromising it too， you know this is like a firm boundary， you just got to put it。

 it's like， no matter what， I'm prioritizing how I feel， I mean feel fucking good， people pleasing。

 if that's compromising， you know me feeling good， I'm just going to cut it off。

 that means no more people pleasing， it means no more holding back your intentions。

 it means no more being fake， okay， prioritize， feeling good， feeling congruent， having integrity。

 above all else， okay， this means sometimes too， if you're， in a situation， where as long as it's on。

 excuse but say it's a situation， you're just， you're just not happy， it doesn't make you feel good。

 maybe it's not a person， that again you have chemistry with， you just don't want to。

 you know talk to her， get the fuck out of there， stop compromising， how you feel， okay。

 this is something that， I mean I play a game， but also just in life， you know if there's something。

 that， see it's required， of me to do， but I just， it just doesn't go against my values。

 I'm just like no， like straight up， nope， okay， me first， prioritize that， if I'm in a situation。

 where it's just like， I don't feel comfortable， like even hypothetically， right now if you threw me。

 up on stage， like say I'm doing an event， and it's even an event， that like generates。

 cash if there's， anything about the event， that I feel like is， off or the compromise is。

 like my values， my integrity， I'll bounce the fuck out， it's like I， prioritize that。

 should about fall， else okay， don't sell out， be it for money， for approval for anything。

 don't sell out， me first mentality， and then， the other point， here is thinking about。

 and this is something， I was reading， Steven Covey's， the， I have it right here， the seven habits。

 of highly effective， people， I'm probably going to do it， for the book club， on my Joanne。

 self-channel， on two three weeks， but he was talking about， win-win， and re-reading it。

 I loved this one， explanation， where he talks about， the contradiction， or paradox， between。

 staying true to yourself， you know me first mentality， having integrity， being congruent。

 being authentic， so on and so forth， while at the same time， being empathetic。

 being aware of what other people， are feeling， being respectful， so for example， say。

 at any point in time， you feel， like swearing， or saying something， extremely inappropriate。

 here's the paradox， it's like okay， I want to say something， very inappropriate， but let's just say。

 there's a little kid around， are you going to swear， in front of the little kid。

 because on your end， it's like okay， well if I'm swearing， if I don't swear。

 I'm not being authentic， I'm holding back， I'm not being congruent， but at the same time。

 what about the fucking little kid？， you know， so it's like， it's what we talk about， it's like。

 express who you are， and then find the win-win， and what he talks about， is he calls it。

 basically maturity， it's like the more mature， you become， the more you can balance the two。

 and that's really the definition， of win-win， you know， you can go the route， of saying， fuck it。

 you know， fuck being aware， of people around me， I'm just going to do， what I mean， that one point。

 it's not that， if they are， like， their understanding， that one point， is very certain。

 the way they complicate， we've seen， these exclintive， groups， they aren't， dent geo， the question。

 them， they wonder， they intern， white， groups， etc， and， where people， have the， look， And， proud。

 peoples， d， print，腋痕ache，但在此都有，舉手，如果例外，你的肩肤，高級，他を持有，正好，枉，似風，高級，肉似，而正在以及在社交�도下，要多不要が、，他連續會追着，會取人隅然觀眾。

不需要知道，例如，這就是完結，主要考慮，提及於，C-10系列，會求使用，需要使用，挑一些，從頭麻幾感，節奏，再來，在懶惰，直接，金牌，如果你有 any questions you have。

I love the worst small group，so lets keep these personal，any questions you have。

any thing you want me to talk about，be it in terms of，you going out taking action，be an accountable。

in terms of sticking points，you have right now，if you want me to talk about。

you know one of these points，that I kind of like，hammered on here，go more in depth，let me know。

any question you have，game，Beyond the game，literally whatever you want，imposed in a little。

Catch box here，而，Let's get fucking started，My current stinking points。

 not having enough consistent results，I can pull a perfect 10 some other times。

 nothing my results are inconsistent，What I'll ask you here is。

 Are your results inconsistent in terms of， you getting the girl or in terms of how you feel while going out。

 Okay， because， inconsistency in terms of how you feel， that you can fix， Okay， when I go out。

 I never have a bad night， However， results in terms of getting the girl at the end of the night。

 that is not entirely in your control， and you're always going to have inconsistent results， Okay。

 when I go out， I don't pull every single time I go out， You know， I don't fuck every girl I talk to。

 Even at the end every girl I pull， I don't necessarily fuck them， Okay， why？。

 Because that's on tire than your control， You know， this baffles guy。

 she had a guy on bootcamp on this past weekend， he pulls a girl back。

 they're making out and shit in her bedroom， and then she's like， no， and he's like。

 what did I do wrong？， And we went over the details of it， and I'm like， dude。

 you didn't do anything wrong， like you did everything right， but guess what？。

 She just didn't want to fuck， You know， there are some girls， no matter what。

 they just don't want to have for example a one night stand， and we just beat ourselves up， like。

 what did I do wrong？， It's like， dude， I don't want to， you know， who knows why？。

 It could just be like， perfect principal， upbringing， like， there are some girls。

 literally no matter what you do， no one night stand， sometimes not even sex on a day too， you know。

 so in terms of， results that way if they're always going to be inconsistent。

 why are you beating yourself up for that？， Focus on what you can control。

 do you be yourself up if it rains？， Like， Julian， some days it's raining， how to understand？。

 You can't control the rain， you can control how you feel though。

 are you always having an awesome timeout？， Yeah， you know，， inconsistent and results。

 that's to be expected， you know， it'll be a lot better， than before like it should go up。

 versus you not finding out about the game， but you're never going to reach that point。

 where it's like any girl， any day， any way， it's like every single night。

 I better fuck a griss like now， dude， you know， on top of that too， it's like one night stand。

 somehow has become， the norm in the community， but realize that a one night stand。

 is like that slam dunk， at a fucking NBA game， you know， a lot of your results。

 are going to also come from like day two's， you know， if you're just trying to。

 like the one night stand， like it really got glorified due to， I mean a lot of travel， with。

 you know， say you're teaching pickup， and you're traveling around， it's like a lot of the times。

 I just have one night to fuck the girl， you know， so there's a lot to talk about， one night stand。

 but if you're living somewhere， it's like what's bad about a day two？， People devalue that。

 like I know guys throwing away， not first because they're like， fuck it's a day two。

 it's not as I don't get as many points for it， like no。

 stop viewing it from a validation standpoint， whether you fuck the girl on a one night stand。

 or a day two， you don't use anything， it doesn't devalue， what you built， it doesn't devalue where。

 it could go， you know， like literally， guys are like， well I fucked her， but it was a day two。

 so lame， it's like no man， like don't devalue the day two， and be realistic， and be realistic。

 I sometimes feel bad about merging， if I'm talking， with an unattractive girl。

 I feel like it's a slap in the face to her， I know this mindset is wrong。

 but what does this blockage come from， since I have good intentions， if， okay。

 so a couple things here， if you feel bad about merging， meaning you're talking to a girl。

 you don't find attractive， and then you merge with another girl， a few different frames here。

 you got to change， number one， you realize the girls are not like you， what does that mean。

 as a guy， when you approach a girl， you know， your identities on the line。

 you've been reading a lot about pickup， you're breaking out of your shell， it's this huge deal。

 you know， it's like， you're putting yourself out there， it's important， okay。

 and if you get rejected， especially in the beginning， you're just heartbroken， okay， that's。

 you know， a guy in pickup， you know， it's frame of mind， for a girl， she's not thinking like that。

 it's not as big of a deal for her， as it is for you， she's not， you know， she's not。

 been reading like， hours or weeks or years， of like， fucking content， she's just， you know，。

 she's showing up， and she's probably thinking， you know， it's all fun， if you leave。

 she's not going to be thinking about it， writing a detailed report， after， okay。

 she doesn't give a fuck， so it's not that big of a deal， don't project yourself on that girl。

 and in terms of like， merging， okay， it's like， if she does happen to be sad。

 because it can sometimes happen， if she does have a， if she does happen to be sad。

 you didn't manage， expectations， okay， meaning that， you led her on， you were fake in a way。

 because if it's a girl， you're not attracted to， you shouldn't lead her on， okay。

 you can still be flirtatious， but it's the difference， between flirting and flirting。

 versus flirting and fuck， every girl you're not attracted to， it has to be clear in the vibe。

 you're not going to fuck her， okay， and beyond that， two in terms of good intentions。

 don't view merging sets， is like， oh， you know， fuck you。

 it's like we're adding more people to the fun， we're inviting more people to the party。

 and if you've， managed expectations too， she'll be happy， because you know。

 you're adding more people， people love to meet each other， that's why merging sets。

 also works so fucking well， and she'll be happy for you， because she's like， fuck。

 this guy provided value to me， we've been having a blast， it's been clear he's not going to fuck me。

 and here he is going for， the girl who he is going to fuck， I wish him well， I sometimes get。

 amogged， by other guys who just linger， forever trying to pick up the girl， that I'm picking up。

 any advice on that， yeah， I mean， first of all， for that question， YouTube， okay， video。

 go on YouTube search， rc julian mixed sets， and watch the video there， but the gist of it is。

 if you're picking up a girl， and you know， guys are coming in， trying to amog you。

 or steal your girl， there's a few things， you know， that you're probably doing wrong， one is that。

 you're not letting her chase， at all， okay， so again， it's like， if an interaction is on。

 like very much on， no guy should ever， ever come in and interrupt， and try to steal your girl， okay。

 it's only when your game is off， it's when you're， either a friend to friend。

 like just very kind of like， a weak friend to friend， holding your intentions back。

 and the girl's talking， you're like tolerating you， what does that communicate。

 to every other guy there， it's like well， this dude is way， lamer than I am， she's tolerating him。

 if she's tolerating him， she'll probably tolerate me， so it's like an easy go。

 it's like low hanging fruits， like let's just get this， fuck her out of there， and get this girl。

 so either your friend， or your friend， either you come off， is very weak， you know， very like。

 not grounded at all， it's like， hey， what's up， like that to the girl， of course some dude。

 will see that， and it's like， jump in， so there's that， or you're chasing too much， and it's like。

 the guy was like over gaming， so someone sees that， it's like， this guy just matters。

 trying to pick her up， look at how， it's hard he's trying， let me kind of wait。

 or let me white-night it， but if you're on point， and it's you being grounded。

 going up offering value， again， gaming yourself， transferring down on her。

 and then she starts chasing， from an outsider's perspective， it's like， it either seems like。

 you're a fucking couple， it's like， oh， again， that whole， like you're already in phase 2。

 it's like she's chasing， you're both， talking back and forth， by being there's， depth。

 those who your couple， or it's just so on， that no guy， would interrupt， you know。

 if a guy's jumping in， it's because you fucked， up prior to that， in the vibe， okay。

 and if a guy does happen， to jump in， remember that， it's a game， of who's reacting， more to who。

 in which case， rewatch， in 10-game， the Tyler versus， Julian in field， compilation。

 the last time I was， in in state， I tried to make， myself feel good， how is the， out of state， game。

 okay with that， it's like， you can't force， okay， if you're out of state， and you're not feeling。

 good it's not about， compitant， like I feel good， and telling yourself， you feel good。

 it's about embracing it， okay， it's about embracing， out of state game， and you know。

 the best way is， really laughing at yourself， you know， if you're out of state， take some。

 zoom out a bit， and look at yourself， from an outsider's， perspective， say， you should learn。

 to find that， funny， you know， like a lot of out of state， by the way is， guys taking themselves。

 way too fucking， seriously， again it's that， you've reached level， 1， you're now， in level 2。

 and you're obsessing， about the game， so much taking it， so fucking seriously， we have to realize。

 that the guys， were advanced， they don't give a， fuck， you know， they care way less， than you do。

 you know， like in terms of， these rules， of the game， they care so much， and that's like。

 I've mastered， every little fucking， detail I just don't， give a fuck， about the details， that's。

 literally， what I do， you know， when you're， out obsessing， even thoughts， about like， state。

 I mean of course， you go through that， phase where you， have to learn how to， stamp out of it。

 and talk about it， a bit here， but I don't， think about state， or how I feel， it's like。

 I don't care， like， what if you're， out of it， who gives a fuck？， like， all those little。

 questions you have， while out， I don't have， it's not about， mastering them， it's about， removing。

 those bullshit， little thoughts， questions， removing that obsession， with the details， and again。

 the way to make a， congruent is， laugh at yourself， whatever you're doing， if you're laughing。

 at yourself is， congruent， laugh at， help pathetic， and ridiculous， you are， just。

 there in the club， thinking about， so much， stressing out， so much， having a facial expression。

 like you're about， to take a shit， or something， like， take some， perspective， and realize how。

 fucking， ridiculous that shit is， and laugh at yourself， that's the way， out of it， like。

 find it so， fucking funny， that you move， through it， and now you're happy， and it's。

 genuine laughter， it's not forcing， yourself to laugh， it's like， take perspective， and just。

 if I can just， show a mirror， to every guy， out of state， like how absurd， that kind of looks。

 and how absurd， his thoughts are， and his thinking， processes， he would just laugh。

 and he'd be in state， okay， carry a mirror， with you， next time you're out of， state。

 look yourself in the mirror， take your phone， take a selfie video， how often you practice。

 those seven， interactive exercises， at this point， I don't do them daily。

 maybe every once in a while， but for a period of time， I would do them every single day， yeah。

 I mean at this point， I've just， designed my life， to the point where I'm just， interacting all the。

 fucking time， so I don't really practice， those that much， I practice， different skills。

 for business， and stuff， but for a period of time， I did those seven， exercises daily。

 oh and did them daily， as well， I got a bunch of those， from him， when I first met him， six。

 seven years ago， so yeah， I do them daily， for at least， a couple， to a few months， until you just。

 you know， until it's like， autopilot， until you can do for example， that 15-minute straight。

 I'll just， no， stop fucking， talking， plowing， do them every fucking day， you know， it's like。

 that's by the way， if you watch the， latest， book club video I did， on actually， here on the。

 slide edge， either read this book， I mean it's kind of， repetitive， but it's good。

 or watch the video， on my join， self-channel， basic fundamental。

 things over and over and over again， you know， it's like those seven， exercises。

 it's easy to be like， well they're just， exercises， it's like no， that's the shit。

 oh and did at first， that's the shit I did， every single day， for a period of time， you know。

 it's like， it's those foundational， things， it's like the behind the， scenes things， it's the stuff。

 where no one will applaud， you know， it's like no one， gives a fuck， no one can imagine。

 an advanced guy， doing these fucking， exercises， but if you want to， get good it's not。

 necessarily becoming， more disciplined， it's just about， having enough， discipline for a period。

 of time until you make， something， a habit， okay huge， where you know， right now。

 I mean I used to think， about this， in business， say with people， who are more successful， and like。

 fuck how do they have， so much discipline， you may be thinking， this in terms of game。

 you're looking at people， who you know， they go out more， they don't have， a trouble going out。

 though I have a， approach， anxiety you may be， looking at me， and be like how the。

 fuck does this dude， go out and you know， have so much， discipline to， barrel through the。

 approach anxiety， and it's not， that I have more， discipline， it's like we all have the。

 same amount of discipline， okay like whatever， amount of discipline， you have right now。

 that's the amount I have， however I've been， strategic in terms of， how I used it to make。

 certain activities， just habits， so I don't have to， use any discipline， on them。

 that's how you get there， you know， for example， never reads， for him to read， ten pages of a。

 fucking book， it requires a lot of， discipline， but say you do that， for like a month， straight。

 it's a habit， and then you can invest， that discipline， that you would have used， to read the book。

 on something else， and then you make that， a habit， and then you make this， a habit。

 so it's like the same， amount of discipline， the entire time， just make habits， out of it。

 so anyone who's good at， game or anyone who's， successful in life， they don't have more。

 and you know， it's like if you find， yourself digging， off again or going， back to old habits。

 it takes time， and you know， set up an environment， that supports， whatever new habits。

 you want to take on， do you have any tips， on handling language， barrier， for that。

 okay well first of all， again it really doesn't， matter like she's， looking at the sub。

 communications， like you don't need to， learn the language， but you may occasionally， get， you know。

 the initial like， nope， like block off， if you don't speak the language， then you can， just。

 get a place， the only place I really， experienced that， I mean not me， but like friends。

 was in Paris， okay so if you go to， France and you don't， speak French， they'll be very quick。

 to just be like no， English， no English， no， English， no English， and just walk off。

 even if you are a， cool guy， they'll just， immediately block， it off like a， reflex。

 I've not seen that， really in any other， country， maybe Archentina， a little bit， like。

 no it depends， on the， ruthless， it's like， it's easier to be， like no English， and you're done。

 like for a student， or something， but if you're on， point like you shouldn't， get any of that。

 but otherwise the， one tip is， just learn like， a couple sentences， or a couple words， learn like。

 how's it going， or hey， literally， you know， and then when you open， spit out that first line。

 or two， that you learned， in their language， so they can experience， you and they don't。

 have that immediate， hope to that point， do you make scripts， for your YouTube， video， yes and no。

 I found like a， balance where， some I just， do no script at all， some are a little。

 heavily scripted， some are in， between the ideal， that I found is， in between， if you do too。

 heavily scripted， kind of like， you pick up， you get shoved in your head， and your micro。

 there's not that same， flow， if you're too， free style， it can be， kind of， all over the， place。

 rambly， it works for me， the best， current， sticking， points I'm focusing on， in life， fuck man。

 I mean the big one， this year was， getting back on， top of my health， which I'm， pretty happy。

 with the， team that going now， is of this week， I'm starting， to bulk up， next few videos。

 next three months， you'll see me， silly， bigger， but otherwise， I， health， optimize all that。

 I'd say right now， that other， things， would be， focusing on， doing， and， amping up that， side of。

 the， it's more like， business， sticking， points， like， setting all that， up， getting all the， like。

 balancing， the research， and the production， of content， that's a tough one， pick up， helped a lot。

 but it's like， to get this， doing， himself， thing， off the ground， you know， you can be。

 doing all this research， looking up， all this stuff， looking at your， experiences， references。

 but there's， like， the taking， in information， and putting， out， and， if you're， just。

 constantly putting， out， at an extreme， high level， and taking， out a lot， so I say that， otherwise。

 taking， point， as I， mentioned， having， a lot of， things， that I， want to work on， the exact， like。

 the unique， style that， I have， the exact， message， that I have， what the brand stands， for。

 so that's the， one， it's a blend， like my strengths are， well， the， two， big， like the two， unique。

 selling points， pick up， and media， scandal， so， you know， it's like， although the pick。

 of videos are， done except for the， occasional one， here and there， the ideas， on social， dynamics。

 will still be， there。， I'm going to， go a lot more， like I'm going to keep， going in depth。

 let's just say， social dynamics， but not framed， is how to， fuck a girl， which is general。

 social dynamics， on the channel。， So， there'll be videos， on social dynamics， on the， downsides。

 so social intelligence， social dynamics， downsides， and success， and then， like a hint of。

 spirituality， so those will be， the three， that I want to， hit on， but， yeah， and passion， too。

 but I need to be， more clear on that， in terms of， sticking points， those， those are the ones。

 right now， that I'm working on， women， not princesses， what are they， for you， I'm assuming。

 we're saying here， that princess has， been put on a pedestal， what are they， for me， human beings。

 the whole idea， of women， are not princesses， it's not to bring them， down， you don't， judge them。

 positively， you don't judge them， negatively， you see them， for human beings。

 in terms of connecting， with business people， who could really， improve your income。

 at pretty unstable， financially， how do you treat your mind， when you go， talk into them，例如。

你一不是用黑事神很接觘，就作为策券的，5月内，要，就像是，更多的误会，我都会试着你，这就是什么你会感到的，我喜欢的，每一刻你试着，很难做什么，或者你试着很难，去 control something。

或者去 get a girl's reaction，或者去 control an interaction，什么是 basic assumption，如果你试着很难，就像是，你试着的。

 life is against you，你试着，如果你不试着，很难得去 get the reactions，我会不会，因为 life is against me。

所以我必须 control everything，for life to be on my side，但是你 once you realize， life is not against you。

 more often than not，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你，你试着你。

你试着你，你试着你， life is on my side， I just can happen， It's all good， and funny enough。

 it becomes a self-fulfilling， prophecy and it does happen。

 I don't need to control everything so much。
