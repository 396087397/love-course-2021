 what I did is I basically coached him on， how to go out with his coworkers but set me non-creepy away。

， Dude， I don�t want to have to go out and meet fuckin�， 1940 girls and hang out with thirty girls。。

 Fuck that。， It sounds like a pain in the ass。， What？。

Latinite also brings out what？，Friends of Latin girls， So even if you're not into it。

 Like I love Miami because I love Miami and Vegas， in New York， Only three cities I'd ever live in。

 I love Miami because there's ethnic girls， There's girls who are different。

 Girls who are very attractive， That being said， A lot of guys are like， Oh。

 but it's only brown girls， Only Hispanic girls， That's not true at all。

 It's all girls of a certain flavor， But they're very distinct in that flavor， Does that make sense？。

 Like I make a lot of racial jokes， But I find it hilarious。

 And like people think that too seriously about me， Because I'm like wait， but like。

 I would only date a Hispanic girl， All my friends are black， I'm like。

 I'm like almost like the United Nations of people， Like I don't give a fuck， You know what I mean。

 I'm like racial jokes against my own race， More than anything else。

 So what I want you guys to understand， Is the more commonality you can establish， So with girls。

 I can't dance， We're shit， I know a few moves， Like I could teach you dance for a game。

 But I can't dance， So I do a few moves， I show a couple things， right？， And， We good？， Good， Sweet。

 I show a few moves or whatever， right？， You take a guy like this。

 Though you could actually do some dancing， He would kill it at Latinite， On a Thursday blue martini。

 Okay， How much he yes or is it some plus when you know how to dance？， Because。

 Also it's not the best dancers， If you're having a great time， Even though you're not。

 You don't know all these big moves， But if you're having。

 At least the girls see that you're having a great time， They know。

 The big moves are actually a negative， If you're too good at it， It's like a guy who's just。

 Oh that's cute， But that's over there， And it's like the girls who are break dancing basically。

 Right？， This is my default break， I don't know， I was doing some leg thing or something， Yeah， yeah。

 My window， Right？， So what I'm just going to say is this， First of all， find a common interest。

 If you can find a commonality， Or a common interest with the girl。

 That alone will allow you to see her， The next time， That you want to see her。

 Commonality building is one of the most， Underrated concepts and all of pick up。

 You find a commonality with the girl， You don't need any attraction， She'll see you again。

 Do you understand？， And then you， And Sasha， The side of these thing I think， It's a small society。

 So you get to see the same girl every time， Or， Yeah， it's got its own like， Like a micro deal。

 Right？， So let's do this， So you have salsa， Which is such an obvious commonality， Right？。

 What are a few other commonalities， Let's each do one， Music， What kind of music？。

 Because music itself isn't really the commonality， Right？， You got to have something a little more。

 For me like the weekend and it's a very good， Thanks bro， It's very popular like。

 Always with a lot of like girls around my age， Dude， with the weekend， Yeah。

 The weekend could put all of us out of business， Fuck that shit， Let's take a little bit further。

 I was listening to the weekend， Lembring the Alex turned me out of the weekend， A long time ago。

 The weekend is， Like I was using the weekend to fuck girls， Before weekend was even on the radio。

 Dude， he was like， what was it？， After party， When that song came on， Holy shit。

 Before he was like performing all these places， Remember that song came out？。

 I feel like nobody knew who he was back then， Holy shit， The weekend or party next door。

 You guys know party next door， Party next door is like the next weekend in my opinion。

 You guys know who he is？， He's the playlist for pulling， Oh my god。

 who knows who party next door is， Raise your hand， Okay， Party next door， Listen to his mix tape。

 I'm never gonna， like I use this as a joke， Like I check out my next mix tape， Party next door。

 His mix tape， Is the most vulgar， graphic shit， Since the weekend's mix tape。

 And it's a twisted plot line， That if you play it to the girl， The girls are just like。

 wait what the fuck， But they're already turned on， So the weekend， G easy is another good example。

 I will take girls to go see G easy， Who barely even know who I am。

 Sometimes I'll just even do a Facebook post， Who wants to come see G easy。

 And I'll have at least 5 or 10 girls， They want to come with me， Right？， You know G easy？， Yeah。

 Okay， Who knows G easy？， Okay， Who is it？， Party next door， Dude， Yeah， that's my nigga， Fuck。

 I'm telling you， Party next door is the shit， And I didn't want to like him too。

 I know I will help me， When I hear someone I don't like， Say they like that person。

 And immediately I'm just like， oh fuck that person， And then later I hear it， And I'm just like， no。

 that guy's got a point， That's some， that's shit's fire， That's just good， right？。

 So what I want you guys to understand is this， It's not about going up， And necessarily looking up。

 Fire next door， listening to that one thing， Right？， It's the weekend。

 What about the weekend is better than another artist， That makes it so good， He's like super sexual。

 Super sexual， Right？， But not only that， But he's so sexual， That girls agree。

 Like I can be up here， And I can be like， tell the girl that Robbie， Listen， I， okay。

 this is really good， I could be up here and I could say， I could say， tell the girl a， a craft joke。

 And she's gonna be more attracted to you， And the feminists and all these women are gonna be like。

 That's manipulative and mean， The weekend can be up here， And he can sing， Give me， give me a line。

 I， um， I fuck two bitches before I saw you， And everyone's like， oh my god， he's so amazing。

 He fuck two holes before he saw me， What？， Like， what are you fucking kidding me？， Right？， No。

 but because he says it the way he says it， And he's got this fucked up haircut。

 All of a sudden every girl is super attracted to it， Right？， But you can't just go like。

 You really can't just pick any random artist， It's gotta be an artist that's super sexual。

 Or someone who's super popular， Right？， Right now chain smokers is super popular， Right？。

 Way more popular than they should be， They're good， but like they are， they are。

 They've been around forever， But they're blowing the fuck up， Right？。

 So chain smokers sign the omnia， If you met a girl yesterday， And you just asked her about music。

 And she said chain smokers， Or even if you just said chain smokers。

 She would go with you tonight to see chain smokers， Period， Right？。

 Maybe you're kind of not quite believe that， That it's all it would take。

 So I was like usually somebody was like， Oh， maybe that sounds about right， But anybody？。

 Like literally， that's all it takes， You know what they say？， Like， looks don't matter。

 That whole like， money or looks kind of deal， Like。

 denogram is a fairly decent looking multi-millionaire， Right？， He's half black， half white， jacked。

 Drives a Ferrari 458 as his daily car， Like， no， the guy right here was talking about me。

 The white one as his car， That's his beater， Right？， Yeah， It's a sick car， right？， I mean。

 it's about as sick as you can get for a regular car， I think so anyway， it's pretty sick， Right？。

 So you take a guy like that， It's just， it's really interesting。

 You take anything about that guy's life， It's designed to push commonalities out there， And my life。

 right？， It's designed to push these commonalities and these common interests out there。

 So the girls latch onto it so we're always with girls， Do you understand that？。

 Looks and money don't matter， If you're employing all this other stuff， Do you understand？。

 You could be George Costanza or me for that matter， And be around a few girls。

 And suddenly you'll fuck a lot harder girls than the girls that you are around。

 And that's really the key to this， The girls that you have in your life that you go out with。

 that you hang out with， They don't need to be the quality of the girl that you're after。

 The girls that are around you can be a much less quality than the girl that you are after。

 But what ends up happening？， There's a competitiveness that happens。

 The girls all get competitive with each other， They wonder what does this guy have that makes these girls want him。

 Regardless of the looks， Do you understand that？， How cool it would be tonight to go to Amnya with two girls that don't want to fuck you。

 But they'll laugh at all the jokes that you say， They'll stick by your side。

 they'll tell any girls trying to hit on you to leave you alone， You're not worth it。

 And to basically run to you every time a guy tries to hit on them， How cool would that be？。

 Is they having a team？， It's like having an army， You'd almost call it the you army。

 I have a question about that， Do they have to be like friends or girls。

 Or can they do girls that use clothes？， So if you want to be the advanced route。

 So I do with girls that I fucked， But just because I'm kind of retarded and silly。

 So I just want to stir the pot， I don't really care。

 I have so many girls that are coming to my life at this point， That I don't really care。

 I just got paid today to tell Lindsey Pellis what to do for school hours。

 I've structured so many weird things in my life， Where I'm going to have those girls coming into my life regardless。

 That I don't really care if I bring a girl that I'm fucking into an area。

 And then like I'll do stupid shit， I'll have a birthday party and invite every girl I fuck that year to the birthday party。

 And not tell any of them what's going on， Just like， My best friend Michael has this thing。

 Anytime we see each other on the other side of the nightclub， We'll just go like this to each other。

 Is this a weird 80s dance or 70s dance， Or does it mean stir the pot， This means stir the pot。

 What we're just trying to find a way is to poke the bear， Stir the pot， Because that's what's fun。

 Otherwise it's not enjoyable， You will always beat out a guy who's better looking than you。

 Who has more money than you， Who has better game than you， If you have girls around you。

 All of you guys all listen to this， Because this is like such a core part of。

 Rarely do I teach like the exact game that I do， I usually teach the game that I know will work for you guys。

 That's duplicatable， Right， Now obviously you kind of would want to do both， Right。

 But that's why I'm kind of making this as duplicatable to you as possible。

 Any one of you can tonight meet a girl that will go out with you tomorrow night， Right。

 Even though you're not here tomorrow night， You can meet a girl that will then go out with you。

 The next night when you go back to Israel or， I think you're going to LA next right。

 This is really really important concept for you guys to understand， The next level than this。

 And I'm going to drill down on how to other ways or how to meet girls。

 Or go out with you the next night， The next level to that is meeting people who will throw girls at you。

 That you don't even know that then you go out altogether， Source of other commonalities。

 We have music and specifically something like the weekend or G-Easy。

 Right because it's very graphic， It's very sexual， Okay， Literally if G-Easy is performing tomorrow。

 And tonight you just talk about G-Easy， You're going to meet a lot of girls who will just go with you to G-Easy。

 Once the girl agrees to doing the actual thing that you want to do with her。

 That's going out with you， Whether that's making out with you or having sex with you。

 You turn all the game off， You back up completely， You guys understand that。

 Once the girl agrees to doing the thing with you， Let's say you want to go on a date with her。

 She agrees to it， You don't tease anymore， You don't do anything， You play the game very very safe。

 So that nothing bad happens between then and the actual date。

 Unless you're trying to pull her that night， Does that make sense？， So for this。

 We're not trying to fuck these girls， We're trying to friends on them， But we're friends on them。

 Do you understand？， Literally call the girl's sister， You want to know how to fuck a girl。

 If this was like a sound bite， It would be sound really demented， Right？。

 If you want to fuck a girl， Call her sister， If that was a sound bite。

 It would be really fucking weird， But why do you think that helps？， If you call her sister。

 You're putting it in the friend zone， But what's the like the pickup term？， Rob or you？。

 What do you think？， Yeah， you said it， You're putting it in the friend zone。

 You're putting it in the friend zone， But what's the like the pickup term？， Rob or you？， Yeah。

 you said it， Disqualification， Right？， You disqualify the girl by calling her sister。

 Because you're probably not trying to fuck your sister， So if you're like， Oh my god。

 what's up sister？， How are you sister？， Right？， What ends up happening is she ends up。

 Wondering why you're putting her in under that label， Makes sense？， Cool， Or buddy。

 You probably went， Want to fuck your buddy， So when you call a girl buddy， Your friend's only her。

 Friend zone is only bad， What？， What was that？， Dude， Dude's a great one， Right？。

 Friend zone is only bad， If you're being put in the friend zone， But you go out tonight。

 The winner tonight is， Whoever can get more girls to go out tomorrow night to the venue。

 They're the winner of the prize， Okay？， Whoever can get the most girls to go out tomorrow with them。

 When's the prize？， That'll be fun， From Omniet's night or from day game， Whatever。

 whatever is that you do， So tonight we're going to almost pretend like you're a promoter。

 But ideally you don't try to sell the fact that， There's some club or something happening tomorrow night。

 You just have some commonality， Or one of the other ways that we're going to talk about to get girls to go out with you。

 Makes sense？， So we have GZ， we have chain smokers， we have the weekend。

 Something trendy and poppy that people like， Ideally sexual， Right？

 Like GZ is the white version of the weekend kind of， Yeah， he's white， right？， And GZ is white， Oh。

 you didn't know that or you？， No， I didn't know that， Dude， but not only is he white。

 He's about the coolest looking white dude， He actually kind of looks like him back。

 He's like a Latin version of GZ actually， Really？， Yeah， yeah， Yeah， with the hair， The undercut。

 is that what's called？， Yeah， yeah， What's that？， Pineapple hair， that's funny， Yeah， Cool。

 It's like about the trendiest kind of hair style， It's like if you were trying to be trendy like a month or two ago。

 You'd put it in a weird funny fucking like， Man bun thing， Like it looks like an onion peel。

 But now this is kind of the right way to do it， right？， Yeah， GZ is really good。

 Give me another commonality that a girl would go out with you the following night for， Anywhere。

 I mean， anywhere， ideally here in Vegas， but anywhere， I mean。

 you're gonna have one of the tougher jobs， Good one in this order， so go for it， Tough for me。

 I come from a very small small place， Like where nothing happens at all， Which though， lenses self。

 me too， That lenses self， though， other opportunities， Yeah， the girls usually。

 Like girls with like guy interests like hockey or sports。

 But do you think like a lot of people here are something self-explanatory？， Just determine。

 Give me a commonality， give me a common one， Just give me super simple， just one commonality。

 one interest， one activity that you guys do in your small town， I could be shopping， maybe。

 I could be shopping about the not the minute store scene， How big of populations is it？。

 It's four thousand， I grew up population undefined， I grew up on a farm。

 And then the nearest town was undefined or undespecified。

 as they were so few they didn't even count it， I grew up in what's called the village of Elk mound。

 How hick is that sound？， They have a hill， an animal， and village， all in the title。

 The village of Elk mound is the name of the town， So I understand， Give me something。

 Do you have outdoor sports？， What kind of outdoor sports do you have？， Outdoor activity。

 I don't want to say sports， outdoor activity， There you go， so today。

 Do you know that some of the hiking in the rocket in America is in Vegas？， It's called Red Rock。

 So literally some of the hiking you could possibly get in the world is here。

 So what can you talk to a girl about？， You meet a girl tonight and you want to do something with her tomorrow。

 That's non-sexual， non you put yourself inside of her， You could talk about Red Rock。

 Red Rock is the hiking area， Does that make sense？， Sushi is like my favorite one， man， Dude。

 I had to force sushi down my throat for like six months， maybe a little less than that。

 maybe five months， To like sushi， But once I did， the whole new world of pussy came into my life。

 I ate one fish and a new type of fish came into me， Dude， I swear to god， no girl likes sushi。

 They just like the idea of it， It's crazy， huh？， Yeah， you saw that？， Dude， I swear to god。

 they don't like sushi， They just like to take the photos and it's like an activity。

 They eat half a roll and they're done， right？， That's a whole catarounds own because I love it so much。

 I'm not gonna love sushi， I just love using it for to pull girls， Sushi is amazing。

 Every sushi restaurant has like a lounge where it's like common seating。

 So you can invite as many girls as you want because it's kind of flexible。

 So the seats that are there， So let's do sushi， Also。

 there's a lot of good sushi restaurants right before nightclubs open。

 Maybe they've been gamed in DC before？， Maybe DC， There's a place they're called current sushi。

 I think they just want my business， I think they changed it。

 But that was one of the best places to get girls was current sushi。

 Because it was a sushi and all sushi restaurants sushi bar。

 And then slowly between the hours of like nine and eleven， It would turn into a nightclub。

 And I love places like this， The high end restaurants would slowly turn into a nightclub。

 And you almost won't even realize it， You're like， you're just like， you're finishing your food。

 You're like， paying your bill and you're like， what the fuck。

 And then you just go and start eating on them， it's fantastic。

 You're talking a little bit further down the line。

 I'm just talking about like getting her physically in that spot to do that thing with you， Right？

 Cause a lot of guys don't know how easy it is just get girls to do another thing with you。

 It's crazy easy， And that will imagine if like， and a lot of guys think social circle game takes months。

 Or they're like， I talked about people who are social circle game， They're like， oh。

 I just wanted to， I want you to happen quick， I don't know。

 I don't know any man in the world who fucks girls as quick as I do， Like， like， I'm talking like。

 remember Iveels？， Who's in game long after what Iveel means？， No？ Invent you lay。

 Means you can't wait until you get home to have a same night lay。

 So you fuck her in the bar or you fuck her in a restaurant， It's an invent you lay， what the fuck？。

 How fucked up will we back in the day that that would eat an acronym？， What the fuck？。

 But that's crazy， So to answer your question and I want you to answer mine is that you tell her while you're on the date。

 To go bring other girls to you， hey introduce me other girls， hey that girl is cute。

 Hey I like this type of girl， Hey which girl do you think I'm going to。

 which girl here is going to be having my baby， Like you say all these things to the girl and then she's like。

 oh okay， well let's do it， Because she was just going to fall into that that you set， You know。

 been pick up speak that frame that we set， right？， That makes sense？， Yeah。

 The more likely the girl is to want to do it because girls just。

 even if they don't like creative things， they think they like creativity， You got it？。

 So art museum， they'll kind of narrows it to like， you have to like museums， you have to like。

 then now it's like， well which art is it？， Right？， Makes sense？。

 But there's tons of random creative shit， right？， There's a lot of these though。

 there's wine events all the time in every city pretty much， Right？， So she， wine。

 outdoor activities， there's a lot of different things you can do， okay？。

 What are some ways to disqualify even more aggressively so that they know that your friends are only them？

， Tell me about girlfriend， Tell me about girlfriend。

 Give me a trait that the girl could have that you're not into， I like grenades， You do or don't？。

 I do， Yeah， so every blonde you meet， it's very similar to me， right？， But at the same time like。

 I probably fuck equal and I don't know， I mean， whatever， who gives a shit？， Right？， Like。

 I'm not gonna like， seriously date a blonde probably。

 but unless this the girl from the Fetty White video， but like， I'm still， it doesn't matter， like。

 you know， but the point is that you have those standards， you have that， you have that qualifier。

 right？， So， oh my god， you're blonde， that's amazing， and she's gonna go。

 what do you think she's gonna say？， She's gonna say， why？， Because you could be my new best friend。

 my new sister， this is great， you can help me find all the brunettes in the club， And again。

 you want the best way to do this by the way？ Like， I fucked， oh， okay。

 guess how many female friends right now I have that like， I go to sushi with or go hiking with。

 Do I look like I go hiking very often？ No！， What？， I walked Starbucks and back， what？， Like， no， no。

 but what's the best part about this？， You can fuck all of them！。

 It's creating a pipeline for yourself！， That's the beautiful thing here， you understand that？。

 You friend zone them every day that you've friend zone them， that they're still your friend。

 you can always go back and fuck them if you want， because you friend zone them。

 The dreaded friend zone， what was that？ What was Lindsay say？ Get out of the friend zone。

 get out of the friend zone into the end zone， I was like stuck in my head all day， right？。

 The friend zone is only bad if they put you， if they deem you friend worthy。

 and they put you in the friend zone， If you're putting them in， it's good， you guys understand that？

， If you put them in the friend zone， I friend zone 100% of girls at all times。

 and then I decide which one I want to sleep with， Do you understand that？， Cool， cool， cool。

 Why is that awesome？ Why is that beneficial？， If they're just starting to friend， Yeah。

 but even furthermore than that， do you think if I friend zone the girl within a couple minutes of meeting her。

 is that a very strong bonded friend material？， I can break out of it in 10 minutes， in 2 minutes。

 You can still do this by being super sexual， guys think the indirect isn't sexual。

 I'm a lot more sexual than most direct game guys that I know， way more sexual。

 Being indirect implies that you're not pretty all of your interest in the girl right away。

 do you understand？， So you want to separate this a little bit。

 and me saying that at least 20% to 30% of my opens are direct， because it's fun。

 Being direct is an easy way to tell yourself that you don't care about the outcome。

 You understand me about that？， So you're saying like， you cheer at the like you， what's your name？。

 Like， is your being direct？， Yeah， but at the same time， if I'm going to go direct。

 I'm going to give myself the best chance of success possible。

 So I'm not going to do something like that， That's the worst thing when a guy goes up to a girl and says。

 oh insert random compliment here， here's my name， So you're giving her a compliment means nothing。

 and then you're also trying to take value by giving her your name。

 The best thing to do is do a proper， if you know like the classic， proper direct， there you go。

 classic， proper direct opener， Hi， my name is。。。， I don't know， it's。。。 no？， Hi， I'm a QS。

 and you're a QS， Yeah， it's like， hey， I was walking down the street there。

 I saw that you were cute， I had to run across the street， I was kicking myself all day。

 if I didn't come over and say hello to you， what's your name？。

 The whole I'd be kicking myself all day， like that's the old school like direct line， right？。

 Any version of that though is fairly direct， But which is fine， but if you're doing that。

 you're literally telling yourself your chances are going to be lower。

 Because you don't care about the outcome， because you're just putting it all out there right away。

 You're showing them your cards， But you can still be super sexual if you're indirect。

 When I say indirect， I don't necessarily mean， you know， don't be sexual at all， Even with。。。

 here's the crazy thing， even with girls that I'm friends owning， I'm being super sexual with。

 The game is exactly the same， I'm just more legitimate with my reasons。

 and why it's not going to work out between us， Because his was almost a little bit of an attraction builder as well。

 that disqualifier， right？， But you could even argue that his was too。

 the whole I have a girlfriend thing， Never in my life I met a girl who wouldn't hook up with me。

 because I told her I have a girlfriend， In fact， right now， at this moment。

 my strategy is to show pictures of my girlfriend to girls， And to say， and then literally I go。

 are you submissive or are you dominant？， Would she take you or would you take her？。

 That's my transition， So like， a lot of these ones that seem like legitimate things。

 they're also strong attraction builders， So I want you guys to understand。

 I've lost a lot of good sets by going direct， I've never lost a set by making her my friend first。

 So I'll give you examples all day long， would I say till the cows come home？。

 Right in our small towns， that's what they say at least， but I need you to come with your own。

 You literally just say， you're my new friend， It's great， you're my new friend。

 but what am I going to do as I say that？， Here stand up as I talk to her， right？， Oh。

 I think you're actually， So， where are you from？， You're my new friend， holy shit， I love it， fuck！。

 Everybody， she's my new friend， I don't know if they heard me in the back， didn't they？。

 She's my new， and then when I， when you， it's a little strategy， right？， Where you wrap the girl up。

 and then you yell really loud， the thing that the girl just said， immediately they go， No， no， no。

 no， no， don't tell her， they kind of cover your mouth， thanks， have a seat， Right？

 So tell the girl something， ideally it's some tease or it's something bad that she just did。

 And then start， like pretend to scream， but kind of scream to everybody out there， you know。

 an imaginary group of people， And she's going to be like， no， no， no， no， I don't say that。

 I don't say that， Well， it's kind of fucking stupid because those people don't give a shit。

 And sometimes I don't even know what I'm about to say， I'm just saying the thing that just happened。

 right？， So the front thing is fantastic， it's just literally calling them my new friends， Right？

 My new， my new bestie， right？， Oh， you're my new bestie， you're my new BFF。

 Go up to girls who are like， just on New York Fashion Weeks。

 like the 15th to 18th or something like that， Go up to girls that like New York Fashion Week。

 and tell them that they're just too tall for you， And just be very， very expressive。

 and they're going to laugh and like bring you in and start hugging you， It's crazy， right？

 If I tell girls that they're too tall for me， like， I'm not super tall by any means。

 but at the same time I'm not short， right？， So if I say it。

 the girls are going to kind of think it's a tease， If you say it， they might believe that no。

 you think that they're just too tall for you， That makes sense？， Cool， cool。

 The problem with non-sexual dates are a lot of guys will go on with they think are sexual dates。

 and then the girls kind of turn into a non-sexual date， Right？ But if you had it off of the past。

 it's kind of like three-sens， If you， like every girl that I make into my primary or put into my rotation of MLTRs has to fuck one of the previous girls。

 Well， how hard is it you think you have a three-sensual girl that within the first night or two that you met her。

 she fucked your other girl， Well， that's the frame of the entire。

 it's actually hard now to not do it， Does that make sense？

 It's kind of like when you friend zone the girl right off the bat， It's actually exactly the same。

 do you like， I'm， it's， it's， no， let me explain it and I'll tell you。

 Tomorrow we'll solve the other thing， right？， You have to do the three-sensual thing right off the bat。

 just like you have to friends on them right off the bat or it's not going to work， Okay。

 if you wait， if you're friends on with a girl for two， three。

 four years and you're this creeper who works with a girl， Right？

 I can still show you how to fuck her， but it's way more difficult than if you friends on it。

 It's so funny， how guys are so， like， nervous about some of the most search terms online is how to break out the friend zone。

 Show me all these girls that you are， all these hotties and nines and tenses that you're actually friends with。

 Like， most of these guys that are， like， looking at kind of stuff up online。

 don't have this list of girls of nines and of girls， Like。

 they're kind of fucking whatever they can get or they meet some random girl at some club。

 They fuck her， she's hot enough， they go with it， Like， she backs， you know。

 she steps up sexually in terms of， you know， for her lack of looks and then they end up in relationship and that's kind of it。

 Right？ But show me this like list of nine tenses that are just like begging to be your friend。

 Right？ It's just not really like that， right？， So what happens when I'm going to show you is how to make friends with these girls。

 And then once you do one friendly thing with them。

 then you immediately go fuck girls that are hotter than her or girls that you fucked in the past。

 Does that make sense？， And then I'm also going to add on to that and show you how to actually fuck that girl later。

 So that makes sense， The last thing I'm going to close with this， We don't， as guys。

 we don't really care which nine or ten we fuck， Do you guys understand when we move to that？， Right？

 I just want to fuck a girl who looks like Nicole Sharesinger or a manual chicory。

 You guys want a manual chicory？， Sloan from Montoraj， You know， Sloan from Montoraj？， Yeah。

 I want to fuck her， I want to fuck every tall， Hispanic girl with bluer green eyes and black hair in the world。
