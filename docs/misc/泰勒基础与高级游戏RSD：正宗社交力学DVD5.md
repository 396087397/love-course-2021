Good morning，I just got to do last night，Seyroom，Yeah， any interesting stories，Yeah。

迂奏friendly，你把這回合拍到，她在自己的習慣，然後那個愿望，所以你 guys want to do is you want to sort of avoid that。

你 don't want to push your 22 far out of character， unless you think you're going to wind up together that night。

 but for the most part， especially if you think you're going to be getting a phone number。

你 don't want to get too much out of character，你 just want to joke around there。

 keep a lot of different topics going， keep it moving forward in that way。

 I think a lot of guys get confused on what it really means to vibe with somebody。

 when your friends say let's go out for a beer， say okay， we'll go grab a beer together。

 that's just to go shoot the shit， that's not to go out for a beer and talk about some really logical topic。

 and say okay， meeting adjourned， let's go home， you just go out and chat。

 meeting women is the exact same thing， it's the exact same kind of thing。

 what a lot of guys will do when they go out with their friends。

 is they'll try and share knowledge as a way of qualifying themselves。

 so they will sort of always want to share knowledge， or impress their friends with things they know。

 things they've done， and that's okay， you can talk about that with women。

 but it shouldn't come across in any kind of way， like you have an outcome attached to it。

 if you can talk to a woman and just joke around， and create a good vibe around you。

 and the purpose of your joking around， or telling stories or sharing stories or asking questions。

 it's just to create a fun vibe and have a good time。

 then you're going to get a great result with that， if in any way shape or form that woman detects。

 that you're trying to impress her with a story that you're saying。

 that you're trying to get a reaction out of her， that there's something that you want。

 that you're reaching towards， that's what's going to kill your attraction。

 so vibing is a conversation that's for the purpose of just building a great vibe。

 if you guys think back to the last time you're out with your friends， having a great time。

 if you could act that way around women， you'd have a lot of success。

 I think what guys have a difficult time is that they have a hard time， acting that way around women。

 it's hard for them to open up in that kind of way around women。

 and of course that makes things more difficult， say that you ask a girl a question。

 you ask a girl a question you get an answer， a lot of guys will just pummel with another question。

 which is sort of like that interview style， you know resume style questioning。

 if you take it in that direction， what's going to happen is the vibe is probably going to go very logical。

 you want the vibe to be more emotional， more silly， more playful， more fun， so what do you do？。

 you miss interpret her answers， see so you know say that you ask a girl where do you live。

 or actually I would never say usually where do you live。

 I might say what neighborhood do you live in， because where do you live is a little bit specific for someone you just met。

 and you know say she says somewhere far away， I might say oh jeez。

 you know I live pretty close to here， I could you know I could get you your own little bean bag chair。

 and I could put it at the base of my bed， and you could sleep there， or you know she might say。

 you know I might say how old are you， and you know she'll say some age。

 and I'll miss interpret the age， and I'll say oh wow you know， you look very young for 40。

 if she said 20 or something like that， you know whatever it is。

 I'm just going to you know just play with it， confuse her a little bit， sort of just mess around。

 keep it fun， so that's really what vibing is， you know it comes back to the stuff that I talk to you guys before。

 about how to hook her attention， any of that stuff is great in vibing， moving her around the club。

 introducing her to your friends， introducing her to other people。

 anything that you can do just to keep it having a fun time。

 I think another thing too is a lot of guys don't get the girl to do any of the work。

 they'll just keep trying to talk and talk and talk。

 because they've had the experience where if they stop talking， the girl will leave。

 one of the things that you have to do eventually， is learn to stop talking。

 and see if she'll reinitiate the conversation a little bit。

 one of the ways that you can do that is you can just kind of look at her。

 with that kind of expectant， you know expecting her to say something。

 and she'll feel that and then she'll start thinking of what to say next。

 if you have the girl not thinking at all， and she's not contribute of it all。

 then what's going to happen is as soon as you stop talking， she's probably just going to walk off。

 most guys' strategy with women， is to go in there。

 and try to qualify themselves and try to impress the girl。

 that's the average guys' strategy for meeting women。

 it's not a very good strategy it's a terrible strategy， work against you。

 if you could just vibe with the girl， and not try to impress her anyway。

 what you're going to find is she's going to start asking you questions， she's going to start saying。

 where are you from？， what do you do？， what's your name？， that kind of stuff。

 so she's going to want she's going to do the work for you。

 she's going to try and figure it out for herself， at that point you can come up with silly answers。

 then give her the real answer afterwards， or you can just not give her the answer at all。

 or you can just give her the real answer it's up to you， but you can mix that up。

 I think a lot of guys get a bit too hung up on that face。

 I remember being in Sydney Australia doing a workshop， and I had a guy who was a doctor。

 which is not a bad job， and the woman kept saying where do you work。

 and he said I work in McDonald's， and she said no tell me where he works， and I work in McDonald's。

 and this went on for about five or six minutes， until I went to Septin。

 and I said hey how's it going guys， and she said he won't tell me where he works。

 so I whispered in the zero I said dude， just tell her where you work it doesn't matter。

 just tell her the truth， and he's like yeah okay make McDonald's， and the girl was so pissed。

 she just wanted to know where he worked， and the reason why was this had gone past the point of playfulness。

 and it had gone to a point where she just she really felt like， he was screwing with her。

 and it was bothering her， and she didn't and you know it was it was actually breaking too much trust。

 it was going you know it was going a little bit too far。

 so you guys how you know you guys that's what we call that calibration。

 the biggest problem when guys learn a you know a dating technique。

 is that they won't learn how to calibrate it， they will follow it blindly。

 because they heard it somewhere， and you know and they'll continue to use it， and it's hurting them。

 so you guys have to use your own common sense， and look at the results that you're getting。

 you know play it you know obviously if you don't get a good result at first。

 you should keep trying it but if it's not getting a good result。

 you need to stop or you need to tweak it a little bit， and we had a question right here。

 it actually happened last night where we were talking to a girl， and the conversation kind of ended。

 and it was clear that it was going to stop， if we didn't continue it basically。

 so I guess my question is is when that happens， and it's clear that you either haven't hooked。

 or the vibing is just not going well enough yet， do you just keep plowing and just keep going。

 and keep talking until either hook comes in， or you know you can tell she's going to respond more。

 what led you to believe that she would talk？， there would be a little bit of silence。

 and then she would kind of look away a little bit， so instead of her focus staying on me。

 you could tell it was pretty apparent， that she wasn't going to say anything。

 even after a few seconds， did you think you had a lot of attraction in that interaction。

 or what do you think？， not enough， not enough， was it allowed venue？， yeah it was。

 I find allowed venues， you've got to sort of just plow through more。

 whereas with the quieter venues， not even necessarily quiet but at least talkable。

 then you know you can have a better conversation， if I'm in a really loud venue。

 generally what I'll do is just talk and talk and talk。

 and then I'll do what I call force qualification， where I'll just try and give some kind of。

 you know compliments about or some kind of generic compliment， that I like about her。

 so that way when asked her her phone number makes sense， and then that's about it。

 because that's about you know， in those really really loud venues， it's kind of a different game。

 because if you think about it， when you've got a music playing， loud on the speakers， that musician。

 is basically， conveying his personality to that girl， do you see what I'm saying？。

 while you're there trying to convey your personality， you've got this musician。

 who's holding her attention， so it's kind of competitive， in that regard。

 you're probably only getting bits and pieces of what you're about， yeah， the music you know。

 yep that's right， so you build energy in the interaction， it builds up。

 I mean how many of you guys here think that you understand， how to vibe with people really well？。

 few of you？， okay， what do you guys think？， what are some things that you guys can come up with。

 that you think might be holding you back？， let's get some answers here， what do you guys think？。

 it could be holding you back， well it's interesting you say about can you vibe with people I find with some people I vibe very easily。

 with the majority of people， but there's some people that， that either you can't bring out that。

 that goofy side in them， or they're just not catching that vibe， or whatever it is in that day。

 where they are， and then， and then it isn't mysterious， and it's like， it's like， it's like。

 it's like， it's like， it's like， it's like， it's like， and then it is a mystery。

 like what the hell is the deal with this person？， but for the majority of the people。

 yeah I can feel that vibe， but it is you know， there's a little bit of a mystery。

 with a small percentage there， have you noticed any commonalities， in the people who don't open up？。

 do you think it's， I mean in your case， do you think it's because they're more low self-esteem type people。

 or do you think it's because you just， didn't come in well enough。

 and they just didn't feel comfortable， or what do you think was the main cause of it？。

 probably a combination of the， the really， either low， or， really kind of a loop， kind of。

 not anything between， okay that's cool， well I think you know， that sounds like。

 like kind of a quality problem， it sounds like you're doing， doing pretty good， who else here。

 what else do you guys think， could be holding you back？， holding you back from。

 vibing with a girl specifically， that's what you're saying， you're just a general， yeah， yeah。

 and I know for myself I， or with people too， I can vibe really well with most people that I meet。

 create rapport， and have a conversation with them。

 what I noticed the difference with last night was， it was so common place。

 it was just so run in the mill， what I was used to doing， so I became， consciously， incompetent。

 throughout the night， which became really frustrating inside of that， because I felt like。

 all my normal bag of tricks were， taken away， and I couldn't just go there。

 I mean I did go back to that， but I felt it totally falling flat， what's your normal bag of tricks？。

 I tend to create， deep rapport， I'll get like really interested in， like what they do specifically。

 and then draw that out into deeper， deeper about， philosophy， about life。

 personal strategies with that， what they're into， maybe it's something relating to a current topic。

 that just happened， yeah， and let me ask you， what's your work for you？， yeah it works， but it's。

 you know I get my courage up to go to one approach， and then I'll just stay with that approach。

 and then I'll just create that rapport， and I don't have a very high flake rate at all。

 but I don't have a high， you know a number of meeting a lot of lot of girls。

 I'll stick with the one， and then I just stay there， you know， because this is kind of funny。

 what this is to me， is like a typical case of a guy， who sounds like， you're doing everything right。

 and then you come to a program， like this， and it's screen you up， it feels like that。

 yeah it feels like that， yeah because I see that a lot， you know， guys that have great game。

 that will come in， and they'll switch it up， if you're getting great results with what you're getting。

 but you don't need to change anything man， it sounds to me like you're doing great。

 and the whole idea that you have to approach a ton of different women and night。

 but if you're already， if that's going the whole night， you're in a perfect place。

 you've got everything that you need， I think what I'm missing though， is I want to be able to。

 it's the really hot one， that I really want to approach that I want to get， and then I get nervous。

 and I don't go to， and it feels like the ones that are， this those really hot ones。

 are like yeah yeah， okay great yeah， you're talking about。

 everything else that every other guy is doing， so how I make myself stand out from that。

 is what I really like to learn， and I get the importance of， you know， creating that。

 social strength， or social conditioning， which I tend to be really shy， with and going in。

 once I'm in there and talking， and I can do that all right， so， okay so what's your goal？。

 my goal is to， have a better， or I guess get over that， nervousness of just going。

 and approaching women， and meeting them， in the street， because I tend to be really shy with that。

 okay， because it sounds to me like， you're doing fine， you know， if this structure works for you。

 use it if not don't use it， you see what I'm saying？， us like Bruce Lee says， right you know。

 take that which works for you， discard that which does not， create something truly wrong。

 you know you don't need to， you know if you heard here， that you're not allowed。

 to stand on the same topic， and you happen to be getting， a great result with that。

 regardless of what you know， most people's results are， if that's working for you， stick with it。

 you know， improve it， work with it， yeah I was over here， you saying you're like。

 you kind of come around， full circle with a lot of things， that you've done。

 you said well I used to be， really joking around， and now I come up， and I answer you know。

 what I really do for a living， and it seems like it's， a bit of that journey， and that path， yeah。

 that's because I kind of thought， that was a valuable question， I see a lot of guys。

 that will come to a dating program， like this， and you know they've got a， great example。

 maybe they hear some new， opener， and they were already， opening 100% consistently。

 and then they think that， their old opener is not， good anymore， that's ridiculous。

 so yeah if you've got， something that's working， stick with it， but obviously if you have an。

 opportunity to improve your， results you may want to try that， as well， so you may want to try out。

 what you do， I mean there's a lot of great， step to learn which time， which is great。

 lifetime student， awesome， you had a question also， yeah just about biving， you know along the same。

 lines of the other guy， who's like， I wanted to be social， last night and so I was。

 like talking to a couple， guys and I sat between， these two guys， this one guy to my right。

 you know I was like， dude this is like， pimp club， you know， and you know he's just。

 kind of ignore me， and then his friend， to the left， you know he didn't see me。

 and then he turned around， he's like you popped， about of nowhere， and I'm like yeah， who deenie。

 and he's like hey I'm， David Copperfield， you know， but the other guy， you know I don't know。

 like I didn't know， where to go from there， and why are you talking to a guy。

 by the way just for fun， or I'm just being， social I mean， like they see me open， some sense。

 no no judge， yeah you know just， yeah just being so， yeah no I think that's good， that's good。

 that's very good， especially because， you have to know， how to talk to guys。

 because most cool girls， do have guy friends， in the club， at least very frequently。

 well you know what， I think that's something， that will just improve， a time， and you know。

 you know， because， yeah man， I mean the more that you go out， the more comfortable， that you'll get。

 you know you'll find， you'll find， that you'll carry yourself， a little bit more assertively。

 and you'll be， you'll be surprised， because if you go out， for a long period of time。

 you'll see the change， in the result， with the way people treat you， it's pretty apparent。

 is there anybody， else here who has， something that they think， yeah， let's hurry up。

 with those microns， get a little run， with those little jogging， yeah around there， there you go。

 right there， I could vibe really well， with people that I know， and girls that I know， and so forth。

 like， for instance， where I work at my， office environment， I could joke around， with everybody。

 and then they get to know， my personality， and we're all having a good time， and so forth。

 but it seems that， like when I go out， into a strange limer， or to a club or something like that。

 you know， it's hard to recreate， that same， you know， that same atmosphere， and what do you think。

 I'm talking about， you know， you all have a good， open air， and so forth， then maybe I'm trying。

 to joke around a bit， then the conversation， goes flat， and then I'm suggest， I'm forced， and say。

 okay， where are you from， and what are your name， all those kinds of， things， and what do you think。

 is the difference， between say， work， versus then， an i-club， the differences， and the people。

 work where， I work with， I know them very well，所以，那些，那些，什麼 sort of stuff that we are into。

 we will talk on relationships， we will talk about， Der things that I know that they know about。

 and that I know about， And I guess I feel more comfortable， because we're all on the same， you know。

 we're all talking about the same thing，嗯，那是一個好好的， One， One of the things to get really good。

 at meeting women， and with people in general， is you kind of have to， kind of。

 screw with your own head a little bit， to make yourself feel like people， who you don't know。

都是嗎 你說得這麼確实，我还是希望一些更好，我也好好安放，你也有講得出來，我報Mark，紅藥，你一定怎麼樣，這個時候，Itsustu，我每得都是，天無處，那口洪樹，把那吸收流保存，公反尝，理b，幹什麼。

一個比較美好的歐歐，在他們一起勝出，感受到他們久任，事件也好，不乎都沒有，有人 Council，在ely you expect that they will，你要紧急嘛，要wardsmINE的。

by，by，by，by，by，by，by，很多人可以很 well with people who they know。

但是 as soon as they're around an attractive woman， around someone who they don't know， they pipe up。

 they can't think of what to say， one of the most common things that you'll hear a guy saying is。

 you know， I don't know what to say after my open， after I open， I don't know what to say。

 I run out of stuff to say， but of course， that's ridiculous because， you've been on this planet for。

 you know， anyone watching this program at least 18 years， you've got a lot to talk about。

 so what this is really about is learning how to unclog that， learning how to unclog it。

 when you're talking to somebody， what you'll find is sometimes they're not going to respond well right away。

 what that might do to you is you feel， might make you feel a little bit deflated。

 because you're talking about something that you like， and they're not responding well to it。

 a lot of what a lot of guys will do is switch it up。

 but what I tend to do is I'll just keep going with it， I'll just keep going on it。

 and draw them into it， because if they give you those looks like what is this， and you keep going。

 a lot of the time， you just kind of overpower， their beliefs about what you're saying。

 and they get drawn into it of course， you know this is another thing that could get miscalibrated because。

 you know you could get guys that are completely ignoring all social feedback。

 and you know looking kind of stupid， but you're only going to learn if you try。

 so I think in another way too if you go out， and you're conveying your personality and you're doing it in a way that you know works。

 you know that other people really enjoy it， and it's not working that one particular instance。

 just keep plowing through it， I think one of the symptoms that a lot of guys get when they learn this stuff。

 is they start to feel like they need to take over every interaction， with people in general。

 so when they're out with their friends， you know they'll become conversation tyrants。

 where they always feel they need to have the attention being drawn towards them。

 if you think about it there's really two ways， that you can be the anchor of a conversation。

 one way is to be the center of attention， that's an obvious way。

 but another way is to have everybody qualify， qualifying themselves to you。

 so to be the guy who's sort of sitting there being the judge。

 as everyone's making their comments you're going， oh that's interesting。

 okay tell me more about that， and they're qualifying themselves to you。

 if you're the kind of guy who's really good at holding court， try switching that up。

 and just sort of seeing if you can lay back and let people do the talking to you， because。

 it's all the way， that the interaction is framed， somebody holding court。

 could look like he's the man， he could look like he's dominant， everybody's listening to him。

 but if you frame that in a different way， if you look at it in a different way。

 it could also look like he's just trying to impress everybody， almost like a clown。

 so in the same way that it can be framed in two， that holding court can be framed in two different ways。

 being laid back and being passive can also be framed or looked at， in two different ways。

 because having people， talking to you can also be framed as them qualifying themselves to you。

 so you don't necessarily feel the need， to have to take over every single interaction all the time。

 you can learn to play with it， I think you made a really good point in a previous program。

 that I saw where you said， you know you want to connect when you vibe。

 and so when we can do that on an emotional level， it's like you know I'm sorry。

 my sister like her boyfriend's an asshole， and she's kind of thinking about it。

 try to make yourself appear to be like a normal person。

 and try to you know can you have do you have that same problem。

 you know do you know guys or jerks or whatever， like you know do you have the same similar situation。

 and I think that was a pretty good point， trying to connect with somebody。

 and that's how you vibe is you know you kind of open yourself up。

 I mean even though you may be making this up， they don't they don't know that。

 uh be said like you know I'm sorry you know I'm just kind of， do you see what I'm saying。

 so you're saying um by telling stories and then she， and then seeing if they'll open up。

 well you're trying to like I find when you vibe， you're really like um sharing like things about you。

 like feelings or emotions or whatever， which is exactly what you want to do with a female。

 mm-hmm so with you start with a story like， you know my grandmother again。

 she's like not doing so well， well I mean that's a pretty bad example but the point is。

 you're trying to get to this emotional level with them。

 and they would interpret that I was assuming as as。

 biping there's different schools of thought on this， um but my school thought uh tends to be。

 keep it fun keep it light the connection that you have is a connection of fun。

 that will move things forward the most quickly， get you the result that you want the most quickly。

 and um you can build the connection afterwards you know after you've had sex。

 but for the most part the kind of when I talk about viving。

 um what I'm talking about is just having a lot of fun together。

 so the girls like this guy is so much fun， you pull her into your world into your reality you take her for a wild ride。

 in your reality you make that great for， that to me is a great form of viving um。

 I've had some cases where I built an amazing connection with the girl。

 uh before we started dating and you know that's work too。

 but I probably had a you know if I were to actually go back。

 like really go back and look at all my like real successes not just phone。

 numbers but like legitimate successes okay uh， most of those girls were just girls who I had a lot of fun with。

 um which has such a great time together that you know sex was just a。

 natural you know way forward from that so to me um you know if a。

 girl were to say to me that she had some kind of problem with her sister。

 I would actually probably move off of that conversational thread very quickly。

 right if a girl says to me uh you know I'm fat or I'm ugly or something very。

 low self-esteem I would probably just say oh well。

 you know I I don't judge that bank move forward to the next conversation topic。

 by the way do you catch why that's important not to not to play the whole。

 reassurance game see if if a girl says to you you know I'm ugly。

 and you say no you're not chances are she believes so strongly that she's。

 ugly she's probably got some kind of head head is she going on there。

 if you try to say no you're not no you're not you're actually breaking trust。

 because you're going against her world views whereas if you just say oh。

 well cool with me you know whatever and you just move past it quickly。

 then she says oh well he doesn't judge me for it and then she's like wow。

 this guy's amazing because he's you know he's a guy who I can be around。

 it's not an issue for him it's like if if a guy's。

 if imagine that you're a hundred percent convinced that you're short。

 you're just so convinced of it that you can't get out of your head about it。

 and you tell a girl yeah god I'm short and she's like really well I like that。

 or I'm cool that that's gonna that's gonna align a lot more with your。

 world views than if she tells you otherwise which may not allow。

 through world views so actually in fact if you just say that you don't judge。

 it then she kind of needs you so that's you know you might as well take。

 that angle as well um but yeah generally for me uh if you know if a。

 conversation thread is going in any kind of direction it's not fun。

 I'll cut it off very quickly the way that I cut it off I'm not going to give。

 some see a lot of guys would be like the big speech like I'm here to have。

 fun tonight we're not going to talk about that I generally um I've taken that。

 angle before it can work generally I avoid that angle now most of the time I'll。

 just go on to another conversation topic very quickly just。

 bank just cut it off go on to something else quickly。

 that's it you know keep it fun keep having a good time uh the common。

alities that I like to build maybe are like places that we both like to go。

 so that way we might have a reason to get together later build that kind of。

 a connection um I'm probably not going to build a connection on some kind of。

 deep emotional issue just because I find that it tends to slow things down。

 uh the angle that I really like to take is you know I'm a guy who's not。

 judgmental about sex um you know I'm just a guy to have fun with。

 and the girls who I really want to start dating afterwards you know I can。

 move it in that direction afterwards uh progressively but generally I tend。

 not to not to build too too much a commonality you know what though I think。

 just like what we were going back to with you it really depends on the。

 person because I know some guys who will build a connection with a woman and。

 that just so attractive to the woman so it really just depends on them。

 and uh you know I've seen that work as well so I think you've got to do what。

 works for you if you've seen how success but not stick to a formula if it's， not getting success。

 qualification okay this is probably one of my strongest areas I know this。

 is something I really worked on because this is something that reduces that。

 flaking and I'll tell you this when you you know when you first start out。

 you have flaking probs you're thinking about everything that you can。

 under the sun to reduce your flaking problems first area of qualification。

 this is very interesting very very interesting stuff so。

 pay close attention to this is kind of kind of can seem complicated first you。

 guys will fear it out say that you're with your friend。

 and you have two girls with you you guys remember how I talked about。

 having lines in your mind of what you'll respond to logically in terms of。

 congruence has for example another line that you need to have in your。

 mind is how cool something has to be for you to respond to it from that。

 girl so if you're with your friends and you know that you've completely hooked。

 you hooked it you've got it those girls are having a great time with you they。

 want to talk to you if you're talking with your friends you want to have a。

 certain line of what you'll respond to from those girls。

 who here's ever thrown a party before any anyone thrown a party。

 all right you guys get a lot of attention from women when you throw that。

 party yeah I got a lot of nodding heads here the reason why that is。

 because you know you well there's a number of reasons why but point is you've。

 got them really hooked in so when you've got those girls really hooked。

 you want that line in your mind of what you'll respond to so if they say some。

 it's boring or uninteresting you might just want to keep on talking to your。

 friend the girl will work harder and harder to bring her the her best self to。

 the table when she talks to you when because she what she's going to notice。

 she's going to sense from you that you respond when she brings her best self。

 you know her most intelligent or funny or interesting things to the table。

 that being the case when you know she's going to have an impression of you。

 like she's a better person when she's around you， and that's going to make her want to be around you more it's interesting。

 it's almost ironic in the sense that if we're around someone who will listen。

 to whatever we say put up with any of our you know put up with any bullshit from。

 us we probably won't value their approval that much。

 but if we're around someone who we actually have to work to gain their。

 approval we have to lean towards them we have to actually bring our best。

 selves to the table we'll want to wrap some of you guys might have the。

 experience where you dated a girl even if she was very attractive。

 she would put up with anything from you and that being the case you started to。

 lose attraction for her and you guys might have also dated a girl who would。

 put up from very little from you and you were always working to keep her。

 enjoying your company and in that case you were always leaning and investing。

 it's a very interesting concept the concept of leaning and investing。

 the more work that you've put into that relationship the more that you。

 value it if you've put nothing into it you probably don't value it。

 so think about that if you're with two girls two guys。

 have that standard of what you'll respond to that way the girl will know that。

 she has to bring her best personality to the table and she'll feel better。

 about being around you the next one is very very important。

 took me a long time to sort of get the hang of this one is the curiosity。

 frame if you go up to a girl and you start asking her questions。

 and the context is that you're trying to you're trying to build her。

 because you're trying to get in with her like every other guy。

 then everything that you do is going to be interpreted context of you being。

 you know you've maybe trying a little bit too hard you doing the work。

 her not seeing anything but you can change that you can switch that around。

 as long as a question that you ask someone is coming from a genuine place of。

 curiosity about them you're coming from a position of power。

 because you're curious there's a very big difference between。

 what do you do that's so cool versus you know what do you do。

 it's a different context that you're bringing and a different emotional。

 response that you're going to get out of that curiosity frame is powerful。

 because it makes people feel like they can open up to you and they can talk。

 to you and you're interested in what they have to say as opposed to you're。

 just putting up some kind of front of fake interest which is what most。

 guys are being out as a result you know trying to get in with her。

 another interesting one is commonalities， most guys really misplay the commonalities angle。

 because what they'll do is you know the girl will say。

 you know I like some chick flick and like I'll say I really like that too。

 because she's trying to prove to her that you know they have something in。

 common but sometimes you guys will have commonalities。

 if you'd like to go out if you're into nightlife you can build commonalities。

 based on that when you find the commonality， you can exaggerate it and blow it up so that she gets excited about it。

 in my opinion one of the ways to legitimize the commonality。

 is also to be very open about differences， let her let her therapy is let her show you why why her opinion is cool。

 and then you know you can grow to understand her and then later when you do。

 find commonalities it legitimizes those commonalities。

 you know if a girl were to say to you I like apples， and you say I hate apples。

 she's gonna try to convince you on apples， but later when she says that she likes oranges。

 and you say that you like oranges you found a legitimate common ground there， so keep that in mind。

 girls love a guy who will just speak his mind， who will just say what he really thinks who's not trying to be agreeable。

 but inevitably you will have those commonalities， and you can you know you can really you know bring those up and focus on them。

 and build a fun understanding out of that， the next one is okay this is kind of like a pimple one。

 you guys know how you know pimps sort of， sort of the art of pimping like how the the way pimps。

 sort of build that attachment with their hose， I think one of the biggest ways that。

 the pimps do that is something that they call， understanding and demonstrating authority in her world。

 understanding and demonstrating authority in her world。

 that's kind of like the stereotype that you see know the model。

 young model she comes into Hollywood， she doesn't really know what's going on。

 and when you understand that world she's gonna gravitate towards that。

 when you understand her world you understand her， what qualification does is it mixes that out。

 when you see when you start to get good at approaching women what you're。

 gonna find you can get a conversation going you can get them laughing you。

 can get them attracted to you but you'll find that you'll hit a road block。

 you'll hit a certain road block because no matter how attracted to you they。

 are there's still that resistance there， qualification does is it trumps that out。

 qualification gives you the reason to call her， obviously girls are not stupid they understand that every guy that talks。

 them probably has some kind of other interest they understand that。

 but the point is is that when you created some other kind of reason。

 she can focus on that it's the same thing is when you say to a girl。

 you know let me you know I'll show you some of my home videos。

 she understands what that's about but she's gonna focus on the home videos。

 because she's having a good time and the interaction is just moving forward so。

 that's okay that is what qualification does it gives you that reason。

 it gives a reason for you guys to get to know each other better so understand that。

 another great useful qualification is using the emotionally unexplained。

 say that you have say that you're talking to a girl and you really like this。

 girl you feel good around her you want to see her again。

 but there's not really anything about her that you can pinpoint that you。

 could qualify her on that's a very common thing， especially you know a lot of the time the more attractive the girl。

 the less developed her personality is but you still might there's still。

 might be something about her energy or the fact she's attractive that makes。

 you want to see her again in that case focus on that。

 just tell her I'm having a great time I feel really good around you right now。

 you know I feel comfortable around you I feel good around you I'm having a。

 great time you know I want to hang out with you more。

 whatever it is the point is you can use that emotionally unexplained there。

 doesn't have to be a concrete reason that you can find you can use that。

 emotionally unexplained aspect in order to justify why you should， continue the interaction。

 next one let me tell you guys about a girl who， who I was dating for a while when we first met I really like this girl。

 and she was telling me about how， she'd done really well in one of her courses。

 she told me about that she told me about how， you know she was you know doing this kind of like a thing where she was。

 helping out kids that didn't have that didn't have parents or something。

 something that effect was this a long time ago and what I did。

 was I was I told her I got a terrible mark in that course。

 see she told me she got a good mark in a certain course I told her well I got。

 a terrible mark in that course what that does is it shows that she has。

 something a piece of herself that I don't have， so whenever a girl says something to impress you。

 be impressed if she's working to gain your approval。

 give her your approval because that's going to happen。

 show her why that is meaningful to you if you can do that。

 what's going to happen is she's going to feel like a better person around you。

 a lot of you guys have probably been in relationships before。

 where the girl who you were dating viewed you in this amazing way。

 and you felt like a better person around her and if you broke up it might have。

 shattered you because you didn't feel like you're that person anymore。

 in a lot of ways you might have depended on that girl to be the person who you。

 want to be or to feel like the person who you want to be。

 when you can qualify a girl properly she feels like she's the person who she。

 wants to be around you and that's almost you know part of the basis of love。

 so that's how you can make a really really strong bond with the girl who you。

 just met is by letting her be the person who she wants to be around you。

 another great qualifier is something we call misdirection， so say that you say to a girl you know。

 do you have a belly button ring she'll answer but then when you meet。

 you know you can look down you know pull her shirt and have a look。

 and whichever one she has say okay good， because you hate the other one you hate the opposite one。

 so say that you know do you have a belly button ring she says you go。

 okay good you know I can't say I want a girl doesn't have a belly button ring。

 do you have a belly button ring you look she doesn't have it go okay。

 I hate it when girls have a belly button ring whatever it is you just you。

 can focus on that in fact this one is almost absurd if you guys try this out。

 you'll you'll see the result with it is pretty pretty funny actually。

 is if a girl has a belly button ring and you looked at me say you have a belly。

 button ring you can't show me that I'll fall in love with you do not show me。

 that don't show it to me don't show it to me and usually even if the girl。

 doesn't even like you she'll start she'll start pulling your head down trying。

 to make you look at it whatever it is look constantly do that girls just。

 love it when guys fall in love with them so they want guys who they even don't。

 like to fall in love with them but the funny thing is that when you do that。

 you're you're getting her to move towards you so that's a great one。

 you know if you think about it qualification， you know the most legitimate form of of you know qualification。

 to me there's really two if I were to size it up there's really two。

 very legitimate forms of qualification the first one is having standards。

 when you have standards and you know what you want in a woman。

 you can give her those standards you can talk about it and she can work。

 to show you why she has those qualities that to me is just you know one of。

 the most powerful forms of qualification talking about that I think a lot of。

 you guys probably don't use that when you talk to women you never stop to。

 think about that but when you can talk to her about you know what you like。

 and you know to me I'll never frame it as you know what I want in a girl。

 friend or anything like that I'll just frame it as you know what I think is。

 cool in a person you know what I think is cool in a person that's generally。

 how I do it when you can get her to work to show you why she has those。

 qualities not only are you demonstrating to her that you're a man of standards。

 and you're not just like every other guy who just wants any hot girl that。

 comes along you're also giving her motivation to live up to be the。

 person who you want her to be if you start dating for example for me。

 dating girls who smoke drives me nuts I don't really like to get to date。

 girls with smoke so that's one of my criteria you know I'm not I'm not into。

 that so I might say to a girl you don't smoke do you。

 I can't stand that usually even if she smokes she'll say no because that's。

 how worse she'll say no then of course when we start dating whenever she。

 wants to go smoke she'll run outside you know she'll go hide it from me。

 which is great because then I don't have to deal with it。

 the fantastic I've seen this because I'll you know I'll see the the cigarettes。

 longer and eventually then they'll admit it and I've actually it's kind of。

 interesting almost every girl that I've ever dated。

 who smokes has quit smoking while we being a relationship。

 almost every single one quit smoking not all them but just about。

 because they just get used to hiding it and then they realize it is stupid。

 and then they quit I think that's really cool， and then the other you know most potent form of qualification。

 is just having a good vibe together you know people do meet。

 without intentionally qualifying each other that's obvious。

 having a great vibe together just makes it obvious that you guys should hang。

 out together that's what it comes down to when you can create a great vibe。

 qualification will handle itself so remember that， let's talk phone numbers how to get the number。

 first thing I'd like to say to you guys is， try for the number of every girl who you approach。

 that's scary huh you're gonna try for the number of every girl who you， approach。

 why is that first of all you want it on autopilot， you want that to be something that you do。

 you want getting a number to always be， automatic thing there's more reasons for it too。

 you never know what girl will call you back you never know。

 so always go for that number now when you go for the number there's different。

 ways you can do it most obvious one give me your number。

 that's obvious a lot of guys overthink this， let's hang out later get your phone out here's my number。

 okay now call me that's another great one why does that work well。

 especially if you're in a place where cell phones are free I don't know。

 someone's watching this another country where cell phones are expensive。

 but assuming it's free after hours or cheap say here。

 punch in my number as soon as you say punch in my number。

 the girl thinks you're another chump who is giving， her his number that she does not to call back。

 so she'll put it in either way she will no girl will have a problem with。

 putting your number into her phone you okay now call it。

 then when it calls it now you have each other's number。

 they say cool we have each other's number because I don't pick up。

 numbers that are blocked great got the number easy。

 another one that I mentioned before this is for newbies if you want an easy way。

 to get a number you could get a number off of a girl。

 probably within about 30 seconds of opening by saying this。

 are you say are you drunk you're drunk aren't you。

 no you're drunk you know what we could have hung out。

 yeah we could have hung out we could have fun together but you're drunk and you。

 won't remember if I call you will you you won't remember of course she's。

 saying no I'll remember even if she just met you it doesn't even make any。

 sense and boom she'll force her number on you bang she will force her。

 number that number on you so fast it's not even funny why is that is that。

 elastic band snapback effect that I was talking about yesterday as。

 soon as you say you're drunk you won't remember me she's gonna she's gonna。

 want to prove to you yes I will she'll give the number does that mean that。

 girl's gonna gonna return your phone call if you leave a message no doesn't。

 mean that but it is a good way to get a number from a girl in a bind if you。

 just want to work on getting more numbers， all right now let me give you guys an example of a sort of a sequence to get a。

 number one of the ways that I like to get a number is I like to mix in。

 qualification with my you know requests for the number I'll build that in。

 so an example of that you know I talked about it yesterday one of the ways。

 that I okay here's a way that I used to close out quite a lot I'll say I used to。

 say all the time you used to just used to get like ten phone numbers and I。

 like this I say you know you're either one of the coolest people I've ever。

 met where you're like a total weirdo she'll laugh at that and then I'll say。

 were you ever a fat kid in high school well you know the reason why I ask。

 that is because you know you have like these cool personality traits and like。

 these are kind of like funny little mannerisms and I would have thought only。

 like a fat kid could develop something like that so I don't I guess I was。

 complimenting you I was saying you know you you have you have the。

 personality of a fat girl you have a fat girl personality I think that's so。

 cool I'll say you know what for the for the same reason why we why we both met。

 I think that's the same reason we both have to go right now which is you know。

 you have to go back to your friends I have to go back to my friends see if we。

 both had no friends then we could have hung out the whole night in our own。

 loser posse but we can't do that so you have to go to your friends have to go。

 to my friends you know what do you have a phone on you here punch this in。

 cool okay call it right awesome you know what I'll give you call later okay。

 awesome go back to your friends have a great night done now if you look at what。

 I did there what I'm doing is I've built in qualification into the。

 number I've used the emotionally unexplained stuff like you know we're。

 having fun together you're you're you're totally quirky and funny what you're。

 basically saying is you know what you can qualify as you have all these quirky。

 mannerisms you're so quirky and funny and interesting you're not really。

 explaining it you haven't really told her what she's done this quirky you're。

 funny you're interesting you just said and chances are she'll probably。

 believe that because probably she is quirky and funny interesting so you say。

 that and then what you're also you have to go to your friends I have to go to。

 my friends what you're basically saying is we're both social people we both。

 have a lot of friends it would it would make sense that we would both hang out。

 and maybe you know mix peer groups whatever but we'll do that later because we。

 both have to go back to to our friends that's a great way to round out to go。

 for a number because you're basically giving her you know when you go to。

 college she goes okay you know he's a cool guy he's got a lot of friends he's。

 giving me called it's just it says a lot of the right things I've had a lot。

 of success with that one had a lot of you know a lot of callbacks with that but。

 you know really come up with your own way to close out whatever it is have a。

 way to quickly qualify and get that number and wrap it up if you have that as。

 funny as it sounds your life will change your life will change because remember。

 we talked yesterday about having that default way to open default way to。

 quickly hook quickly get a vibe going get touching going quick way to。

 qualify quick way to get number if you have those things you have those little。

 pieces your life will change because every woman who you talk to you can。

 meet her like that it's automatic it's an automatic thing so have those。

 pieces find one that you like so important。
