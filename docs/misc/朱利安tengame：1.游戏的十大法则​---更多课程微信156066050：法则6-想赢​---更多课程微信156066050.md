Pinkwin win is asking yourself what's my goal， what's the girls' goal how can I make it win win。

 every time it's not win win you get rejected， huge， okay， and this could apply on a general level。

 and on a macro level and on a micro level， on a macro level it's you know no girl wants to feel like a slut。

 you could be fucking offering value， making yourself feel really good being real。

 you make or feel like a slut， you will get rejected。

 you're not a goal to her goal of not seeming like a slut。

 you're done every time you're an obstacle you're done， okay。

 another one is you know a girl like as we talked about before。

 a girl in the first part of the night， like when she goes out。

 she wants to have an abundance of fun and maybe sleep with someone at the end of the night。

 is a climax of that emotional buildup， not in the beginning， you try to pull her early on。

 you're an obstacle to her goal you'll get rejected。

 you try to maintain and keep that interaction going for four hours， you'll get rejected。

 that's not her goal to talk to one guy for four hours， you say something that's too far out there。

 that she can't relate to， you're an obstacle， and this is the most important one， you go up。

 you offer value， you make yourself feel good you're real， throw that shit out there。

 look at how she responds， is it too far out there， or is it like too extreme or too boring。

 and calibrate after the fact， huge， because otherwise。

 as you said like you'll get a lot of these comments sometimes， like are you drunk？。

 are you on drugs？， you're crazy， all those things are basically signals of slow at the fuck down。

 okay， I like to view it as pressure on pressure off。

 and you kind of tensed just basically look for tenseness。

 or looseness that's what you're looking for， say something that she tensing up。

 you'll see it usually in the eyes， tensing up in the eyes looking side to side， nervous laughs。

 haha steps back， anything like that means slow at the fuck down， you're too far out there。

 you slow it down too much， she's too loose， bored， not engaged， and you got to find that sweet spot。

 yes， real fast， there's a shame as offering too much value， no。

 so I always like to view it like this， this is you， this is the girl， anything in this circle。

 is congruence to you， so understand， you being real， and being congruence。

 and doing something that you genuinely find fun to you， that makes you feel good。

 isn't just one action， there are many things you could do。

 when I'm talking to that girl and I'm mentioning for example， the say fuck me I'm proto。

 after that I could talk about the period blood， but I could also talk about something else。

 it feel just as good， basically anything in this circle， I'll feel good， her。

 anything in this circle， she's okay with， she'll be able to relate to， so I'll go up。

 and I'm always being real to me， so I'll try something， I may try this。

 and then I'll look at her response， because this is not in her circle， she's not going to relate。

 she'll probably tense up， or get too bored， then I'll try something else， maybe this。

 still not enough， so I keep calibrating， switching things up， but still staying in my circle。

 until I hit this sweet spot here， that's when you got her， sometimes you'll hit it off the bat。

 sometimes not， that's when you calibrate after the fact， and then the more time you spend。

 you'll sign out the more of these two， overlap， and the bigger the sweet spot， however。

 as we mentioned before， some girls， no matter what， you're not meant to be with them。

 and there will be zero overlapping， so I'll try a couple things。

 and then realize that there's an overlapping， have a great night， yes。

 and then the more from left you later in the night， I mean， yeah， later in the night。

 it'll be a little different， and also the more time you spend， you know， it's like the more comfort。

 you have the more togetherness， the bigger the sweet spot， okay， yes。

 this seems like it's a lot more related to what you're saying， now what you're doing， doing as well。

 what if you're talking to multiple girls， and some girls are like slowed down。

 and other girls are like yes， like they're all friends， and you're like。

 what do I do with all of you all， game your target， okay， okay， when the friends over。

 we'll get to that with this one here， when the friends over。

 but it's like you should be gaming the fucking target， prioritizing the target。

 and beyond that you should be able to switch in between the two， you know。

 it's like I'm getting on her， but that means I should also hit on the friend。

 or you switch the vibe up and you type the friend， every girl is very different。

 and you'll just develop a fuel for it， just look at any tenseness， any type of vibe， and yeah。

 every girl is unique， some they'll be like totally down the extreme thing off the bat。

 some not at all， but your job is to find that， and you find how like fucking。

 there's a game like battleship is that it， you like sink the ship， that's it， you try try try bang。

 you find the sweet spot， sometimes off the bat bang， you sink the ship， you got it， that's game。

 okay， but this is big， if there is no relatability， it's not gonna work， okay。

 and you have to accept too that some girls， there is none， some girls。

 no matter I'll try and keep trying to calibrate， and the only way to make it relatable。

 is to do something that's outside， of what's authentic and congruent to me。

 faking manipulating if you will， okay， and this is one of the most important ones， so yeah。

 if you have a question， yeah， so when you want to talk about something for example。

 the more general is the bigger，， the smaller the spot in the circle， so if they're like， yes and no。

 because it could be so general and boring， that it's not fitting her excitement。

 you know what I mean， if it's like general left at parts of it over the lot。

 could you be like more general of the questions at the beginning。

 and then become more specific when you know， what， like， if you're still interested， you could。

 but I'd say just， it doesn't matter， it's like， as long as you calibrate after。

 it's like it's pretty rare， okay， think of it this way， don't do anything too far extreme。

 I rarely do anything extreme， like one thing， that's a good question， okay， here's。

 here's 99% of my opens， and actually this brings up a good point， 90% of the time， I tap tap。

 if the girl's facing away from me， I tap tap， so she looks at me， if she's walking towards me。

 I'll see it， and I'll get a feel before I even talk， so what does that mean？， most guys， like。

 the girl's facing away， they're like， hey， and that can immediately spike up way far out there。

 and she's like， fuck you dude， however， if I wake up tap tap， and she turns。

 sometimes she'll be like， or someone's like， and you can get like， oh， assess。

 and then your first action could be more relatable， so try that one， tap tap。

 usually I'll do a hand shake too， tap tap， hey， how's it going？， bang。

 and then you get a feel and then you can either， and you can also see how she shakes your hand。

 some girls are gonna be like hesitant， some will be like happy， some will squeeze hard， some won't。

 some will hang on for a while， some will try to pull away， you can kind of assess it that way。

 but don't let it stifle you either， it's just like be aware。

 and make sure that you don't compromise， what's congruent and authentic to you。

 does anyone have any questions on this one here？， because this is big， when you go rejected。

 is it because you went everything over？， or was it because you filed， with the police？， overall。

 relating， because remember， what's her goal， to have fun？， it's not to have some leech you do。

 if you're not doing any of this， you're not gonna hit the sweet spot anyway， however。

 when you do this， you still have to be aware of that， otherwise， again， you can turn into。

 the drunk guy at the bar， pointing beers over his head， is he congruent？， yeah。

 is he making himself feel good？， yeah， it's not relatable， an interaction is always two people。

 it's like you having your fun， but still always keeping an eye on her， are you still part of it？。

 are you still part of it？， slowing down， it's like emotional masturbation， you jump in。

 if you're going too fast， you're gonna have to slow it down sometimes， if you're going too slow。

 you have to go too speed it up， finding that sweet spot， where you can both match your speed， yeah。

 10th loose， 10th loose， 10th loose， 10th loose， 10th loose， just that， yeah， so be real thing。

 that boat， do I have to go on and see， how like， massively would it affect me real。

 I haven't read it at her， do you think I'm reading that boat， would be just like， it's good。

 however， think when win， being real is two， like being real， you could also be like， well。

 I'm gonna be real， and tell about all my fucking baggage， that is not gonna be relatable。

 and it's not gonna be win win， combine the two， it's gonna be the only one that has been relatable。

 and it's been more practical， yeah， it's been like socially aware， it's realizing you're not alone。

 and there's two people， being aware of the girl， and make sure she's part of it。

 and you don't go against any of her goals， her goal is not to listen to all your life problems。

 at least early on in the interaction， yeah， it's just like a sad question。

 but having a game for so long， do you think your circle has gone on really big。

 or do you really know what you want， it's just like super strong。

 the more you get out of your own way， it is true that， the more there's relatability。

 because there's a cool dude overall， yeah， so it does expand over time too。

 but there's still a lot of girls， where there's not， yeah， you're feeling you have to。

 like reel in your emotional power， because I do a lot of hair on， I'm like， fucking out there crazy。

 and then sometimes， that's not really what I'm doing， sometimes that's not really what I'm doing。

 it's just like， don't think reel it in， think control it， think， do you see the blueprint， oh。

 Tyler's program， he talks about the brush fire， versus the hot searing cool， there's like two。

 there's like usually like the three faces， you'll go through， guys， the stereotype is， guys shy。

 you know， holds it all in， then you realize you can unleash that shit， so you're like。

 like over the top， but then you're too far out there， so then it's like， controlling it。

 instead of being like， beaming everywhere， like， fucking a lot more subtle。

 and stronger and powerful， or another way， Brad talks about this， is like。

 don't be the wolf be the gorilla， two ways of being alpha， the wolf's like， barking in your face。

 the girl is like， hey， you know， there's that book， two by David Hawkins， like a power versus force。

 using force， use power， you know， the same here I could talk， and I'm like very grounded。

 I can reel you in， or I can like， overdo， to try to dominate， so it's like， being more controlled。

 not holding back， controlling it， and realizing too， it's like， be careful down too。

 because you realize， you can unleash it， and then there's also that belief。

 if I'm not always doing all this， it's bad， and this is actually a good one。

 to a good point you brought up， when you see me doing all this shit。

 with the fun and the jokes and stuff， I'm doing it because I want to do it。

 it's not because I need to do it， big， okay， another challenge you guys all want to do at some point。

 is see how， quote unquote， boring you can get， while still， making yourself feel good。

 being real offering value， and still get the girl， what's the minimum， to get the girl。

 that's the baseline， and then from there， you can amp it up， and do whatever you want to do。

 because you want to， not because you think you need to， otherwise it's a lot of pressure。

 if you're like， oh I better be joking around， and I'm as much fun as julien。

 like so fucking carefree， it's too much pressure， then you're always like， the bar is too high。

 the reason I'm able to do that， is the bar is low for me， so all the pressure is often。

 then that naturally comes out， because I want to， not because I think I need to。

 does that make sense？， yeah， this is a bit relatable， are you working， practice。

 what do you want to do， go to the register， or the meeting， how do you make it， how do you make it。

 fun by the， the words don't matter， focus on the vibe you're giving， it's like， what do you live。

 it's like， check me out， check my vibe out， check how awesome I feel， check how awesome I am。

 again the less you can get caught up in this surface， shit the better， yeah， you don't have to。

 you said， like you're being real， you don't want to， go too far， like the baggage。

 you're going to be vulnerable， so when you're being real， and you want to be really， just tell her。

 and you're feeling， such as， you know I ran out of things to say， or you're going to be。

 a purpose for it， isn't that not really， a problem， no because it's like small things。

 it's like little spikes， when I'm saying， baggage it's more like， you know I was like。

 abuse as a child， and then this happened， and my mom left me， like all that shit， it's like。

 being aware of the context， yeah， but otherwise little things， like I ran out of things to say。

 it won't affect the bigger picture， anything that could affect the bigger picture， and you know。

 sometimes， sometimes it may， sometimes it was like， which is also why it's important。

 is a little sign of it， if you say the， ran out of things to say， keep talking after that。

 don't be like， everyone thinks to say， try to， feel good， and provide that， right after。

 actually one last thing， too I did want to mention， with the win-win。

 this also applies to small scenarios， I'm a big one I pointed， at a lot of sand。

 bootcamp is if the girls， walking， stop always trying to， just stop her， because guess what。

 you could be the shit， if she's going， from point A to point B， sometimes she'll stop。

 but oftentimes， she wants to keep going， to point B， you can't， just stop， and keep in mind。

 that you want to get， as far away， from the place， you open her， as possible。

 you don't want to stay， where you open her， because you're not， going to fuck her there， the first。

 the way you get， the better， so keep that in mind， and the same， with pulling， which will get to。

 most guys， they just keep trying to， pull instead of， going with the girl， try to pull， but if not。

 you become， okay， it has to be win-win。
