我都跟你說，S me trying to tell you before I laid my eyes。

S me trying to tell you before I laid my eyes on you，S me trying to show you。

S me trying to tell you before I laid my eyes on you。

This is Julien and welcome to the first infield mission， Now。

 at this point you've already gone through the Ten Laws， So， you know what game is， Okay。

 you logically understand it， You've gone through the infield breakdown， So。

 you emotionally recognized it as well，你已經經過在你跟隨了，陰影廠收 hope，但現在時間叛計，從發生短，驄逢的死刷，OK，因为十年ng，我一天endos，然后。

重點在大約40，行不？，存在價的時候就決定，差相4個人，跟她要世界的，有WG好 successfully，酷養，給她女朋友，有零食，值了，佳知道，你自己不小心，離成美國，我有一個想法。

而且無論魚是要計端，包括A肚自己，一個大發現，而且有件事， Shen Dubuque，中国在赶紧去 mindy bar，是有风格的，昂开多一 fancy，一点也好，删口，要实在计算，大家很重要不断租。

OK，right now if you told me， like hey go out every day for 30 minutes， I'm not like， oh my god。

30 minutes going out and interacting with women， I'm like， of course， you know， it's like， yeah。

 it's not a big deal at all， it's just normal， it's not like， pick up time， it's， oh。

 I'm just chatting girls， you know， you're in line at fucking Starbucks， hey how's it going？。

 you know， you can probably get in like five minutes there， there's just five minutes， you know。

 say you're at the fucking grocery store， another five minutes， you're walking down the street。

 maybe it's after work， you're heading home instead of going home， and watching you know。

 some little TV show， you just chat someone， because the after hour bars， after hour restaurants。

 like Patio has it going， now you got your 20 minutes in， OK， it's really not that hard。

 and it should not be that fucking free， OK， this is really， it just pick up。

 like the less of a big deal， the better， even you interacting with girls。

 if you don't view that as a big deal， it'll be a lot more casual， you'll get out of your own way。

 stop viewing sex as a big deal， this is not， again， the big pick up time that I turn on， OK。

 so you really have to make this， part of your day to day life， it's a way of being。

 where every single day， OK， for the next seven days， you're going to go out， OK。

 now what you also notice here， is you know， if you've applied， what you've learned so far。

 and for you at a awesome eye depth， OK， now I've been reading through， you know。

 the 10 game Facebook group， and you know， some of the stories， are just fucking epic， however。

 you probably realize， you go out， you apply this， you have an amazing time out。

 you go home and then the next day， the old thought patterns， take over， and you're back into。

 you know， you're kind of stifled， you know， headspace， and what you have to understand。

 is that right now this stifled you， that's you that you've been building。

 over all these fucking years， there's a lot of， you know， autopilot thought patterns。

 that just take over， and if you want to make， the you that's out， you know， on the fucking weekend。

 having those epics， you know， times out， those epic experiences， part of who you are。

 you're going to have to work on this daily， OK， you're going to have to。

 really start letting go of all， these fucking autopilot thought patterns。

 that are getting in the way， like stay stifled， stay conditioned， don't express yourself。

 this is this is you， the quiet introverted you， you're going to have to， get more references。

 and start installing new thought patterns， that basically promote the opposite， OK。

 and if you just do this， like once every week， like on the weekend， it's going to be very hard。

 to just make this who you are， OK， it's going to be very hard， to get out of your own， fucking way。

 24-7， so you have to do this every single day， and what you also realize。

 is that you're going to build a momentum， and this is something， that really helped me。

 when I started out in game， I started out in Switzerland， and I remember at first。

 I just got Friday Saturday， and what I realized is that， Friday， it was always hell。

 you know I not gone out， like the first you know， like Monday to Friday， so I'm just like oh my god。

 like kind of in my head， here we are the weekend， and I'd hustle hard on fucking Friday。

 and it would usually take all night， and then towards the end of the night。

 I'd start kind of getting， in that nice flow， really getting out of my way， expressing myself。

 it was pretty awesome， went home， and Saturday hit， and Saturday instead of starting。

 down here where I was out on Friday， I kind of started up here， and I was like oh I kind of。

 pick up where I left off， took things even further， and then I wouldn't go out to the next Friday。

 and what I'd realized is that， every fucking Friday， I'd always restart at ground zero。

 and I'd waste every Friday， getting back to where I was at， the previous weekend， so if right now。

 and this is what I changed up， in my game in Switzerland， instead of just going out Friday。

 Saturday you also had every single day， in between， you maintain that momentum。

 okay now nothing's really， probably going to happen in 30 minutes， you never know though。

 you really never know， but say you go out Friday， you build it up。

 Saturday you pick up where you left off， you go out 30 minutes， you stay up there。

 and when the next Friday hits， you pick up where you left off， instead of wasting。

 every fucking Friday， getting back to where you were at， okay it also keeps that feeling of。

 as I mentioned before， being unstifled， feeling good， getting out of your fucking way， alive。

 and it just starts setting it， is this is the new norm， okay so， this is crucial， you have to do it。

 make， again this is the mission， this is the challenge， the next fucking seven days。

 every single day， go out for 30 minutes minimum， okay so I mentioned to a date counts。

 if you're in some small， you know， city somewhere， what do you do， just go out， say Thursday。

 Friday， Saturday， try to maybe some numbers， and then set up some dates， okay and if not。

 just go to a shitty bar， you know even if there's no， hot girls， just interact with， females。

 okay this is， you now， you're going out， you're putting yourself in the， situations， it's not like。

 I'm me， who stifled， and it's the weekend， and I explode， okay so every single day。

 and to hold yourself accountable， I want you， to create a post， in the 10 game， Facebook group。

 okay you're going to create a post， say mission one， and every single day， under mission one。

 I want you to， just write a little recap， of your 30 minutes， okay every single day。

 and I'm going to scroll through， them I'm not going to answer all of them。

 but I'm going to scroll through them， and I'm just going to see， you know who's。

 actually doing this， who isn't， and you know， just hold yourself accountable， try to do it every。

 fucking day， next seven days， you're out， you're doing this， and you'll realize， like after a while。

 it'll just be very， fucking easy， it'll be smooth， maybe a little tough at first。

 and you'll realize， like well it's resisting this， but it really wasn't that big， of a fucking deal。

 okay so， seven day challenge， 30 minutes a day， that's your mission one。

 we're going to build on this， next week， with the infield mission two， create that fucking post。

 in the 10 game Facebook group， post in it for the next seven days。

 and I'll see you next week。
