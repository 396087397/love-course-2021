你們可有些職業在任何地方，每天都沒有買到，這項面子士的很有 consumers，擁有些達人士，聽說自己有一些人，說自己的父親，也支持你們，但是他們在曾經， years，你們能乾脆的，親客他。

他們小時候一定同在，證明我們，有開軍團在，照片駛，中國主持人的研發一家總理，要亦公其實來因此，心得十多天，要喝 머리膨， ARE YOU CEisse，‧ 🍦 🍊， mixer，بة，iko，do。

real， само，👱😓，我REWATER，？！？，g，ccуса，ha，o，of， teaching，a，oh，uh，ark，你能够得到很多的东西。

但是 by having a team around you， Having people that can help you。

 will leverage your time so that you can do much more， So learning how to delegate。

 and giving up those things that can fail， when you give it to the wrong person。

 or if they aren't trained properly to do it， is a process that you need to learn。

 and leadership when you're in any kind of organisation， You need to be able to train the people。

 let them fail， train them again， make them succeed， I think that another kind of leadership。

 that I heard a lot discussed was from the Air Force， which is that you do it。

 and you figure what it is， then others will do it。

 I think that it's a very common practice for you to create what they call continuity manuals。

 which is an organisational process， by which you get really good at matching a particular role in an organisation。

 and then you write all the basic things and advanced things。

 that you think are sophisticated and you write it out。

 and there's nothing that is so complex that can't be turned into words， it just doesn't happen。

 unless it's like being， I was going to say it's like being the sign print。

 we're going to change his name to a symbol， the musician prints。

 but then you can describe what that thing looks like and might take a long time。

 but it's still possible， and then giving it to a new continuity manual to somebody else。

 and allowing them to understand what it is， of course you can't just read a manual usually just meet what you do it。

 so that leads you to the next step， which is the leadership of mentoring and guiding somebody to accomplish your goal。

 you may accomplish the query of expectations and manuals by created。

 tons of manuals for every position in this company。

 and I'm given most of the people in this company who work for this company。

 for the first five years， and I would say most of those people don't remember。

 90% of what I wrote in those manuals， we've upgraded a lot of our training manuals and we'll even give clients manuals。

 for example if you take a bootcamp you might get a bootcamp。

 tactical manual if you take a Vegas immersion program you might get a。

 Vegas immersion orientation guide manual， and these things may help。

 put some query to those patients but， it shouldn't be relied upon to people who are just going to read these things。

 that you create， instead of we know everything that you want them to know。

 so you got to be that guide you got to lead people。

 it's always a process that you'll see in any kind of leadership， I know that even in my。

 my family my parents， I would be told， to do something and told three different ways to do something and how to do。

 that exact same thing， because it's a constant repetition if you watch a seminar speaker like Tony。

 Robbins， he'll say the same thing， one two three times or more before moving on to the next topic just saying in。

 different ways， so that you're continuing there because， the human mind。

 will more likely remember things when they've heard it。

 more than one time and then by doing it again and again， it'll become， a wrote or routine。

 that you're able to do， with those， responses that they built it's kind of like riding a bike。

 and that will happen when pretty much any kind of thing。

 but you need to leave room for those learning lessons， don't make it so that your micro-managing。

 as a leader so much， that there is no room to grow， there is no， room for failure。

 because if you don't， if you do that forever， it's just going to be suffocating。

 and it's also going to be， moving that， feeling of freedom and most people want that feeling of freedom。

 that feeling of free will that feeling of choice， and that feeling that they could accomplish something so it's not like。

 they're forced to accomplish it but they actually accomplish something。

 that thing does work a lot in those， situations where you must have success and you kind of break the whip and your。

 micro-managing everything and you know that you know exactly how to do it。

 and sometimes it is important for you to do that， so know that there's times and places for you to do that。

 but if it's possible for you to let go and relax， you should do that as well because then you're growing as a team with objectives。

 as to kind of like growing a team where you have your， objectives and it's not like team objectives。

 you only have your individual objectives， so it depends on how you want to run your team if you want to run it more。

 militaristic， or if you want to run it without positional leadership。

 which is going to be a more powerful situation， a powerful situation is a situation where you have each team member empowered to。

 accomplish anything， and I think that's a lot smarter。

 now there's a lot of people who talk about how goals， spends objectives should ideally be。

 smart and there's an acronym for SMART I believe it's specific， measurable action oriented。

 and results tracking and timely， and if you could use goals that have each of those elements。

 then you will have more fluid amounts of success， and more time but at the same time you need to be very flexible。

 because sometimes these goals because I prefer goals that are not so。

 static and so specific sometimes because I think specific goals are great。

 but I like goals that have also another element which is the ability to be。

 completely flexible and change into something completely different。

 any moments notice many times we'll have a goal and then one thing happens。

 out of that field and that goal has to change， and although when you have emotional investment in the success of a goal。

 if suddenly you're told that goal just can't happen you need to have this。

 other goal should be better than that goal it's frustrating。

 for me it really really erics me and it's really really difficult。

 by having to listen and I have to change my mind I'm willing to do that。

 even if sometimes I'm interacting with my staff and I'll get really。

 frustrated like no we can't do this I'll be saying that and while I'm saying。

 that I'll be thinking well maybe we can do this， but I have to have also an opinion you should always have an opinion。

 about what your mind is but when you're turned to a side where you're going to。

 bend on issues don't bend on issues you know will fail。

 know from field experience what will succeed what can't succeed。

 but you need to have a line where there is certain things that if you're saying。

 no you're saying no because it's not one of those issues where。

 it can't change but it's noting that it will fail for sure。

 most of the time though when you're hearing an issue it isn't that it's like。

 you might not have heard or fully understood or appreciated depending。

 of the other person I can use a really listen to all their ideas and then。

 really think outside the box for a bit if you still aren't strong。

 disagreement one of the best people doing that is。

 tower and his leadership style but you need to also explain why you。

 believe what you believe your team will listen if they truly believe that you。

 are having intersecting interests and that you have a。

 mutual goal that is going to be mutually accomplished with a meritocratic。

 incentive that you both have together so that you guys will not have。

 crisscrossing goals and crisscrossing belief systems。

 I'll sit in board meetings with Tyler and I'll have an instructor。

 come to me and he'll talk to me about something and I will say。

 oh that's an interesting idea I just don't think we could do that and then。

 Taro will go wait a second let's listen to all the reasons why this guy。

 wants to do that particular thing and then he'll say it and he'll go okay。

 cool now here's what I believe or the reasons why。

 Nick doesn't want that Nick you can tell me if I'm right or wrong then he'll。

 press his opinion about why he thinks that both of us might have a。

 slightly different opinion about different things and come with it even a。

 third alternative but because he's listening and because he's。

 seeking out very deeply to understand what other people are saying before he。

 says his thing and he'll take him consideration deeply what we're all。

 saying it'll need to a much more happier solution everyone will。

 have confidence that they were listened to so regardless about whether we。

 get what exactly we want we're overall not going to be frustrated that we。

 weren't heard and we're in a situation where if people are not happy with。

 what they're getting within an organization think of the either。

 organization and if they wanted to do that they'll be missing out on all。

 sorts of cool opportunities and we'll miss out on opportunities are working。

 with them and that's why we want to make sure also that the。

 leadership is from a standpoint that the goals the benefits of being part of。

 the team and following the leadership that we've created is going to be in the。

 best interest of everyone and only when you could do that and have that stick。

 and care in the right place and at least try to have that stick and care in。

 a better place than it previously was the day before and continue you。

 optimize that process only by doing that， where you have the most effective formal leadership within your organization。
