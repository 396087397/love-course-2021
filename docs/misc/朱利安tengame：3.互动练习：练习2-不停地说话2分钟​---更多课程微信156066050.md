他們有一個厲害需求，英國 gelir，娜爾被迫，能騰錯的，可以請痷，但沒有也可以，8叢， immer過音樂，7，演場，有時候，有人的動畫，沒這經驗，有人說，aling，擦上去，看看，在你。

 Winston，要問，都試一次，我但不要，我寧願你能夠指求，심訞愿著舉查及聲音，你まMania。，卡爭，聶入茶了。，0。。。。3-3，2 minute見，行吧啦！， Bis she bam。

 Bye Ladd，梁秋才，是我生後崇美，今天別人Mank concentron， fast go，一跟一块，你 Heay faster，You can do faster，啊。

如果 she doesn't know the spots I don't feel， she can't have blue， so my standard， even faster。

 faster faster， see how fast she can go， same， wrap it， wrap it， being stuck in my head。

 not being able to fully express myself， running out of things to say， you know， you can do faster。

 come on， fast，嘿， first all 乎 hear  did not make it all the way through。

乎 hear 做个 second break minimum，me honest，me honest，me honest，yeah。

 everyone else went all the way through， alright， alright，now this one i like is it's challenging。

 two minutes sounds like， ah just two minutes， it feels like a fucking long time。

 and the only way you can survive this one， is shutting off your fucking mind， that's it。

 if you have any kind of image， if you're judging yourself in any way。

 you won't be able to flow fast， you could flow slowly but if you really want to go fast。

 you can't even be thinking or analyzing what you say。

 it should just flow out because everything logically about every word you're saying like。

 does this make sense？ is this good enough to say， you will never be able to go fast。

 okay this one you can do like every day， i recommend do it every day wake up in the morning。

 look in the mirror， so i just got on my bed today i'm in the mirror i'm looking in the mirror。

 but won't like that non-stop， once you manage two minutes you five to ten to fifteen。

 if you do fifteen minutes non-stop like that， your night's out will most of the time。

 has to be increased okay in results， let's switch two minutes， go as fast as you can go。

 like a fucking rap song， three two one go go。
