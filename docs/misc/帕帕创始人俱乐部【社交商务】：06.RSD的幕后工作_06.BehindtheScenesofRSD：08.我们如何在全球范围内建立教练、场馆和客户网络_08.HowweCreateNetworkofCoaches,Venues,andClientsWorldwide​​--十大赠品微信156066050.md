因為這事情在這麼看 starting manner，很多人也會告訴你在，有些東西更具吧，看到我们研究的需要，彰正 żeby目的，觀光，和平 order，首先，我們接種了這系統 troubleshoot。

讓我們住在國土地跟 real estate，坐在房間是否舛工作，再逐一邊，同學家，在此，一手舛車，自從老闆，等 popcall girls，對了，對阿江的那種土地，您頭，用補左邊吳續婚的，收集金玉玉。

你的混 Secretary，因為他很快樂，剛剛我們也很簡單，罷了之前沒有吃飯，我們兩杯生巴，加普罯ター，我想完美，之前開始，想說，我們沒有去加早期，可是我們有三高些，你還差30多元。

3100 and maybe more on average， Then you are going to have a situation。

 where you have to go to the hotels， and venture convention centers。

 especially when you have now 1 to 3000 people， and these are the challenges we have had to work out。

 and as we were as old our expenses were a lot higher， and we are fronting a lot。

 so you have a situation where you have large free accounts， large amounts of people。

 in order to cover those costs， you hope that a percentage of people， they come to your free events。

 will sign up for the paid event that weekend，每個月都兩天都得通，相當整體性，因為拍攝的退� robots，那個累也不是續氣，而且幾乎環境，你可以出現。

只是張達石，沒有了，但顯示，這跟調查，是他們用的，遊戲，需要按怎麼辦呢？，到底，對此一切， And the knowledge and skill set that you learn is extremely valuable。

 And as a result of having spent tons and tons of hours doing that research。

 And transferring those skills to you， and being dedicated doing that， Our guys are able to。

 you know， we keep the money and convince their clients。

 A sign for their program that becomes student to get success， And they share with their friends。

 they continue to grow， It's an awesome system， We've gone from situation where we were in couches，吧。

和享受助 joining，這麼長時間，持續加入，以及所有條約，結合，以及和 save，每週，同一週，就好，我和朋友， liegt，然後，你要，我，跟朋友，做了，小 healthy，還有，販壯，要怕。

一個，ui not john，教哇，R300-600R，DVD set，programming，R&R World Summit Program，It was a great way to。

 kind of like build our market， On the other hand， now， our following。

 isn't a completely different format， Most of our following， is on social media。

 Not only do we have a Facebook group， a main Facebook group， but we have， over 200。

 almost 300 Facebook groups， in different cities all around the world， with tons of people。

 anywhere from a few hundred， to a few thousand people， interact with each other。

 kind of like as a fraternity does， networking sharing stories， meeting up live， face to face。

 going out to the bars， and clubs， picking up girls， and then using services， like Snapchat。

 where instructors， will share their， adventures and videos， I know that Tower。

 releases some content， like I remember seeing a video， with him in New York， where he's like。

 hey I'm about to go to New York， here's me getting on a plane， oh here's me， about to go。

 into a seminar room， and talk about picking up girls， him on stage， talking about picking up girls。

 him saying， okay， a seminar is over， here's the lessons that I taught。

 here's me going into a nightclub， oh here's a video of me， about to walk with a pickup girl。

 oh here's me in the girl， talking about how I want to hook up， at this girl。

 oh here's a picture of me， making out the girl in the alley， like I said I was。

 here's me going into the department， oh here's me walking outside， and talking about what happened。

 in the night， and he might not with a friend， over some coffee， it was pretty awesome。

 just to be able to share those moments， in real time， with these old video snaps。

 I remember when I was on tour， this didn't exist， I was just doing Twitter。

 you're sharing your Twitter feed， with the， I think it was 180 character maximum。

 and then posting that on Twitter， Facebook and all sorts of other， social media at the same time。

 and now we use YouTube primarily， as your means， communications， or in videos。

 and the future will probably， be something else， we're even super， paired。

 we even have broadcast devices， just in case we were to hit， radio or television。

 but we're continually， on that cutting edge， of technology， social media。

 and all sorts of other things， and the biggest part of that， is because in terms of investing。

 into our marketing， in terms of investing， into our game point for growth。

 a lot of it comes from the investment， in our video production teams。

 we spend tons of money on AV gear， gained some of the best guys， from Hollywood， from music videos。

 from movies， from TV shows， and putting them into， the Real Social Dynamics Network， of RSC Nation。

 sharing stories about， how to pick up girls， the adventures， in the infield videos。

 going out to the bars and clubs， you're learning lessons， from going to try to add。

 at Cinemac effect， because in order to captivate， the minds of people， you have to captivate。

 also their hearts and eyes， and when they see， all these interesting things。

 and they're used to be entertained， from the movies， and you see it in the video。

 it really helps go a long way， in terms of how you， like prepare a message， in terms of game people。

 be raiding fans， being followers， and I think it's also， a lot more fun for our guys。

 a lot of our guys， used to be burned out， from the boringness， the routine of it all。

 pan instructors， literally just quit， even though they're making， great amounts of money。

 just to pick up girls， and we really get it， and transferring those skills， to others。

 just because they didn't， have that network of people， they didn't have that， network， innovation。

 that comes together， from being a part of a team， a team that travels with you。

 now in the other hand， we also have corporate， marketing and sales， and local marketing， so。

 these teams， would also be involved， in developing the local， marketing brand， of the instructor。

 while they're traveling， around the world， at the same time， at corporate， where we have our teams。

 spread among， not just one instructor， but all the instructors， and all the interests。

 of the global， artists you've brand， working together， they work together， and working on customer。

 service when you call， we'll answer your calls， we'll follow up， we'll make sure to。

 process fulfilled， and also give the， overall marketing， game plan for the company。

 so that the vision， is congruent， and a team works together， and shares insights。

 about what's working， in terms of marketing， and what's not， able to share， all the。

 confidential information， they want， and they're able to， also develop， their own content。

 and proprietary methods， it's a pretty cool system， it's a lot of people， working together。

 though we also have， a corporate travel， and finance team， this is the teams。

 that create the budgets， for the travel， from around the world， because it's extremely， expensive。

 it's a team， time can see， it's not like my old， tool where I was running， an issue-stringed。

 budget for $2，000， something dollars a month， these guys might， spend that in a day， just。

 and the venue is alone， they might spend that， it's， pretty much a， completely different。

 company that we're， running here now， because we have a massive， infrastructure。

 that's continuing growing， revenues growing， higher than never， our influence growing。

 higher than never， but the ability to， manage that， requires， three very careful things。

 the first thing， is having strong， clarity， clarity， is basically， conveying the， expectations。

 of what you expect， from just the team， from the individuals， the roles， responsibilities。

 the results you expect， the clarity of the vision， of what you plan to， accomplish。

 overall for everyone， as a team， so that their individual， goals are accomplished。

 and making sure that， everything is， crystal clear， whether it's in， writing， whether it's。

 verbally， where it's done in person， usually all three of， those are necessary， in order to make。

 your message， completely clear， the second part， is communication， making sure that。

 we're going to be， talking to each， and having， more points of， contact， physically， so。

 email is not as， preferable， voice， which is， not preferable， just not preferable。

 meeting in person， we will literally， be able to， just to meet in person， for those messages。

 that can be conveyed， in the period of， like 30 minutes， just because， the face-to-face。

 interaction， builds emotional， rapport， and also， that communication， you can look at someone。

 in the eye， and feel the trust， you know what it is， you know， that what is being said。

 is what is being conveyed， and should be conveyed， and the third part， is that follow-up process。

 making sure people， are doing their jobs， how the resources， they need， and that you're falling。

 up to make sure， that everything， is the way it's， supposed to be， because even after。

 you have a queer， expectations， you， communicate， and as you follow up， with it and。

 you see what results， happened， you're not， going to be able to know， whether or not。

 everything is the way， it's supposed to be。， In the future，， we're moving a lot。

 more of our operations， to our main basis， which is in Los Angeles， and Los Vegas now。。

 We have this huge house， here in Los Angeles， and also in Los Vegas。， We have offices。。

 We have an awesome， training facility， that you can check out， during the RSC World， Summit。。

 And these are the two， cities where we have， the most amount of staff， and we have the people。

 traveling here， from all the different， instructors' teams， of marketing， video， guys。

 and the instructors， themselves。， So they can get training， with Howard directly， as he is not just。

 a figurehead，， he also like the Steve， Jobs visionary。， He is the guy， who is creating that。

 mission， to constant innovation， in each of our， instructors， and business teams。。

 They also will innovate， and having， everyone here， in those places， where the innovation。

 takes place the most， is how we build a， strong network，， how we build our teams， and how we get。

 our clients around the， how we make an。
