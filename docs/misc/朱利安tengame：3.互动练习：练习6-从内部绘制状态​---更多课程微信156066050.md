# 朱利安ten game：3.互动练习：练习6-从内部绘制状态​---更多课程微信156066050

OK， this will kind of give you focus on drawing state from within，OK， and this one's a little tough。

 So， groups to two， one guy is going to be the girl， the other guy is going to be the guy。

 I'll have you do this one again if you want， So， I'm the girl。

 you're the guy you're going to hit on me for 30 seconds， Here are the rules。

 all you're allowed to do is ask me interview more questions， OK， that's any kind of question。

 like so what do you do？， What's your name？， Whatever the fuck's the question？。

 As long as it's a question you're good， You're only allowed to do questions。

 you can't say anything that's not a question， Every time you ask a question。

 before asking the next question， you always have to wait for my answer。

 Every time you ask a question， it has to be extremely positive with a huge smile， OK。

 and you can't base your next question off my answer， It's always a new topic， new question， smile。

 Wait for answer， new topic， new question， smile， And all my answers will be negative， So。

 if you ping off me， if you're trying to take from me， if you're dependent on me， to fuel your state。

 you're going to get shoved in your head， and it's very going to be tough to draw that positivity and that smile when you ask for the question。

 So， the only place you can come from is internally， you have to generate that shit， OK。

 I'm the girl， huge smile， like really amplify the positive， You're like， what's your name？

 Even trying for a port sonality， go， So， where are you from？， Even happier， happier， So。

 where are you from？， Does it matter？， Where did you get that shirt？， Even happier。

 Where did you get that shirt？， A store， I like your hair， I like your hair， I like your hair。

 I have a boyfriend， thank you， How long have you been in LA for？， Dude。

 I just said I have a boyfriend， you not hear me？， Did you not hear me？， You see it， What？。

 What did you play at the place you shot with？， Get the fuck out of here， I have a boyfriend， OK？。

 Get the fuck out， You're smile， dude， you're pinging off me， generate that shit， So。

 what's your favorite celebrity？， Dude， did you not hear me， I said I have a fucking boyfriend？。

 Are you retarded？， No， no， no， no， you're not get this， You're serious now？， Yeah。

 I'm not fucking around， you're serious， What's this？， Yeah， ask another question， Favorite food。

 please， That's not happy， I want full smile， What's your favorite food？， Dude。

 why the fuck is that your game， is that all you got？， Dude， just get the fuck out of my face， go。

 go， get the fuck out of here， go！， Seriously dude， who are your friends？， Dude。

 who are your friends？， Dude， do I have to get security or something？， Get the fuck out。

 this fucking guy， Who's your boyfriend？， That guy， dude， Alright， you're gonna get mad here， Now。

 good， but notice that times it's like， if it gets a little confrontational。

 you're taking it personally， If it's not pure love and positivity and smile，， you're pinging off me。

 Like no matter what I say， I'm gonna get the fuck out of here， You should be like。

 so what about this？， Like， peace， zen， and pure bliss， That's how you should feel， However。

 the only place you get that is internally， And your reflex is to fucking be on the offensive。

 Or to get kind of shoved in your head or to have a comeback， You can't， just like， no， no， no， So。

 be mean kind of in your answers， Now， a little heads up here just to make this clear。

 If this happens， like if a girl's giving you those answers， Well， out， leave the set。

 you did something wrong， This should not happen， This is an exercise where two dudes。

 You give the negative answers， just sort of forces him to get used to drawing that from within。

 Okay？ 30 seconds each， One guy's the girl， And again， when you're the girl。

 give all those responses you might have gotten wallowed。

 Imagine you're the bitchiest girl in the world， Go， go， go。

 go。
