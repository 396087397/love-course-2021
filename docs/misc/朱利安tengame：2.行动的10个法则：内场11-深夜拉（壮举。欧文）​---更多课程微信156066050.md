所以我也是你，完了，二人的手指，是你，嗨，嗨，嗨，嗨，嗨，嗨，Silly and Nice to meet you，嗨，嗨， Nice to meet you，No I just saw you。

 say hello，嗨，你 guys leaving？，Yeah，What are you doing？， Crazy time，No I'm waiting for my friends。

 they're coming out right now，What are you doing？，My friends，My friends，I was like through that。

I'm sorry I'm sorry， but don't call you up，Silly and nice to meet you，Where are you going on？。

Where are you going on？，Where are you going？，Come back，Come this way，Cluster，Cluster。

Now this is one just to kind of， like introduce this video。

 This is one where I'm actually feeling kind of out of it。

 Okay if you kind of recognize the location， this is where we shot this introduction for the hot seat 2。

 back in the day， the first video I kind of ever put out with infield。

 and I was extremely in my head， when I actually shot that， So we just shot it now。

 and then it's like， oh last set open， and I'm like， oh hello don't go， and some of this stuff。

 I'll point out that I should have been more on top of， is for example this girl is like。

 well what's going on then， when she's like， what's going on， you have a fucking plan。

 oh this is going on， let's go， I'm like， I don't know but just don't go， you know。

 So it's not extremely on points， however， it's good enough， and I like to show this too。

 just to show how you don't have to be perfect， just be good enough， you know。

 and that's a fine line， you just want to find， where you know， it's like。

 what's the good enough line， where you can be boring enough， fuck up enough， and still get the girl。

 once you see that the， bar is pretty fucking low， then all the pressure is off。

 and then you can do all this other stuff， because you want to， not because you need to。

 guys for example， see me do this crazy self-musement， they're like， fuck I need to do all this。

 but by thinking， you need to do all this， there's all that pressure put on it， it's like no。

 you need to do is this， and then you can do this， because you want to。

 so all about the place it's coming from， so this will be one of those interactions。

 kind of out of it， but still pull， no， no， they're pretty， thank you though， oh。

 this is my friend Owen， he's going， he's going， he's going， he's going， he's going， oh， he's going。

 yeah， I don't know， I can't， that's what I， alright you want to smell it， I'll light。

 here I got this for you， oh my god， I saw you， that's really smooth， that is so smooth， thank you。

 I tried to， no I know， I'm sorry I'm sorry， I know you guys， I tried to be slick。

 I tried to be smooth， do you wear contacts？， I do but they're not， colored， okay， interesting， wait。

 fuck you， yeah， that's all you got， I'm on my head right now， I'm on my head right now。

 I embrace it， I'm on my head right now， why I'm waiting outside by myself， I'm just like。

 I know why， what's going on， well I left the club earlier， and I still was like fuck。

 I should have stayed in longer， that was it basically， so， that's all you got。

 I think we're going home， after party， next to Rosewell， you should come， don't embarrass me though。

 where is it？， next to the Rosewell Hotel， you don't have to， I'm not like， come to the after。

 it's like just after party， they'll be there， she's in love， you got her Rosewell。

 you got her Rosewell， she gave you to my， you did it， they were doing nothing， good work， good work。

 after party， after party， you， tell her， weasel's， recessible， that's going to far。

 I'm fucking starving， I have an idea， 25 degrees that's up and down， another big fuck up。

 I'm kind of starving， I have an idea， do you have pizza？， if a girl says， do you have pizza？。

 what do you say？， yeah， I have every kind of pizza， you know， in my bed， every pizza， let's go。

 I'm like， no， we are， we need pizza， we can grab it on the way， we can grab it on the way， like。

 yes， it's stupid， it's pizza， it's better， deal， grab it on the way， we'll stop at， yeah。

 very spicy， we'll stop at Ralph's， pizza， we'll stop at Ralph's， like， what the fuck。

 let's go to a grocery store， get pizza， and then go， it's like no， she basically set it up。

 like you guys have pizza， understand too， with part three， a lot of these girls。

 want to keep partying， they want to keep that fun， going， they don't want to go home。

 they don't want to keep that fun， going， pizza， party， whatever it is， let's go， why do you pizza。

 by the way， perfection， and then I fucking call her out， I mean， pizza， why do you even eat pizza。

 you fat ass， like， just， so bad， I feel this delicious， although， LA pizza is not that good。

 I agree， you suck， where are you from？， oh I am from， now here's what happens to， me and this girl。

 starts off okay， and it kind of dies down， if you guys noticed， and here we're all talking。

 suddenly this girl， starts responding a little bit， more to me， she starts responding more to Owen。

 and you'll sometimes have to do this， you know， it's like hey， if you want to make it happen。

 just yeah， switch， so you'll see this， like quickly go for a switch。

 this is something you kind of feel in the vibe， okay， it's like。

 here it's not probably going to happen to me and her， I mean still could， but it's not。

 off to an ideal start， and just kind of reading， by the vibe here， they connect a little bit more。

 we connect a little bit more， you willing to switch， is there going to be a pizza there。

 I'm from Ottawa， Canada， we have fresh， better pizza there， oh no， so notice。

 she's like oh no to me， is there talking through that way， oh yeah， the pizza is not nice， yeah。

 except， which one， here is， and that is， down， this is actually pretty cool。

 it's about a two blocks， on third in the， steniga， it's like down two blocks， really。

 yeah it's like after， it's pizza， they have a lot of pizza， and， don't， don't， don't be like， I am。

 bang， switch， don't judge， you're right， I'm good， nothing happened tonight， that was cool。

 everything is sucked tonight， why are you visiting， or do you live here， bang we just switched。

 okay， and another important， dynamic if it's like， four of you， there are times。

 we're going to want to talk， all four of you， but maximize， like one-on-one， one-on-one。

 we don't need a lot of pizza， hold on， we're health-free， well， nice to know， you're welcome。

 welcome， actually， predicted you coming out， just give it to that girl， no。

 I know a romantic like that， I try to be， yeah and I'm not a bullsh**er， okay not anymore。

 my attraction， is from this， no， I'm joking， what was your name， yeah exactly。

 do you remember my name？， not unless， Julian， okay I did know， I do know， because。

 yes you did say that to me， I don't know how I'm talking， I appreciate the forgetting my name。

 I appreciate you， come after party， you don't have to， you guys don't have to come， we're reading。

 you guys are sisters， yes， you guys， hold her， younger， what did you say？， you're more mature。

 but she can just be more good， exactly， I'm more mature， yeah I love you， oh girl you。

 it's such a dick， sorry I'm not a dick， I'm very， I just tell the truth， I never lie， I never lie。

 I never lie， I never lie， of course I want， I never lie， I'm a liar， I'm a liar， I'm a liar。

 I'm a liar， I'm a liar， I don't get my butt， you're getting my butt， I love you， I just。

 I just want to dance with my rose， I just want to be， the only girl in the world， no， anyway。

 I'm the only girl in the world， okay good bye， you can stay， Ohio， alright you're a dick， move on。

 I'm not I'm not， okay I'm sorry， every time I say， I ever just move my mouth， they're like。

 I'm so sorry， I'm so sorry， I'm so sorry， I'm so sorry， okay no okay， one last chance。

 one last chance， bang， push the little too far， in terms of pressure on， slow it down， she's like。

 you know you're a little too far， you're a dick too much pressure， it's not bad， it's still playful。

 it's like， it's a little too much， can I say something now？， but I get it， here's the thing。

 if I can give you some， maybe， no no no， tips one last chance， inside the tips， trust me。

 there's always one last chance， like in the movies， one last chance， okay， so she's like， yeah okay。

 all I have to do here， is just slow it down， use what we call， statement of empathy， like hey start。

 let's fucking around， and keep show some realness， okay， because the self-emusement。

 if I just keep pushing it， like I was before， if you do too much， of one action， it can turn into。

 security， it's like those guys， that said before， who keep acting， if they didn't hook， okay。

 so here's like， okay too much， slow it down， hi again， I'm actually really， not a dick。

 and I wasn't， nice to meet you， I love your rose， thanks， I did that， smells good， come back。

 come back， hold my head now， you got me stuck in my head， oh my god， shit， fuck that part。

 I did not， I did not fuck out， yeah you did， you're fucking， I was like， yo asshole。

 you don't even know me， and you already fucked it up， no I'm sorry， yeah you did that hard。

 I was for the pizza， I'm all down for the pizza， well I didn't do the pizza， it's delicious。

 I agree， if you don't， here's the problem， girls， if you want to wait， you don't like 10。

 no tips no tips no tips no tips， okay， I'm a man， real man， it's true man， maybe you should。

 bite your pride in 2012， I'm not， I'm sorry， actually I'm sorry， I'm not， I just。

 I want to speak with my， in 2012， so actually， good for you， you go with your plan， you rip it hard。

 core， and I wish you best of luck， hey， stop being like that， I'm sorry， no I'm just saying。

 you said one last chance， I said I was sorry， hey， this is my， hey， this is my view， and here。

 I crack into my Academy， award winning speech， of you guys already， that just flips it around。

 it's like slow it down， bang， I'm sorry I bet before， I was intimidated， I was an asshole。

 I apologize， I'm really sorry， I did not mean it， it just came out， and I'm actually really。

 cool guy， and I do actually， like you very， I want to say quirky， even though it sounds mean。

 it's a compliment， trust me， so I really am sorry， and I don't mean it like that， I swear to God。

 I know， I got hit， I'm not， I got it， thanks， you're all， so， you guys are going to。

 so you're going to， like， yes， next to Rosewell， that's just not， like a meaning， why what are you。

 living， I'm like， they're walking， right on the street， we're west， out of one， bang。

 so that was the resistance， to the after party， before I'm saying， Rosevelled， and here she's like。

 well that's not really， convenient for us， I'm like why， where do you live， right up the street， oh。

 in that case， fuck the Rosevelled， let's go to yours， do you have pizza， do you have pizza， wait。

 do you have drinks， like any fucking reason to get there， do you have drinks， let's go for drinks。

 I occasionally drink， I didn't drink tonight though， but just， I don't have to， I didn't。

 I didn't want to stop， sad， do you have pizza， do you have pizza， do you have pizza， it's so good。

 yeah， yeah， you know it's crazy， TV is so good， it's so obvious， it'll be show， anyways。

 no no no no， not my dabba， it's good like your ship， well thank you， and come， after party。

 after party， yes of course， come， what are you， left， there's stone bars， I'm sorry， no I'm sorry。

 that's another line， I'm sorry， I can't myself before I said it， I fucked up before。

 so I'm actually， being completely honest， and nice right now， hey I stop now， there you go， proof。

 me and me and you， are gentlemen， I'm sorry， I'm sorry， I'm sorry， and the cool thing too。

 if you're going to a， girl's place is like， you can have the， logical excuses like， drinks， pizza。

 whatever， but you don't need that much， because those girls， are going home anyway。

 she's going home， going home， right， let's go， yeah， come on， come on， come on， come on， come on。

 come on， come on， come on， come on， come on， sorry， I did so， sorry， you call it， sorry， I love it。

 it's the opposite， sorry， sorry， sorry， sorry， what do you do， it sounds very cliche。

 but what do you do， thank you， okay， so again， pick up is messy， keep in mind。

 don't need to be all on top of that， but you do need to be smart， at those occasional。

 moments there， okay， and you have， bind temperature on your side， and with go with。

 when you're going with the girl， and it's like， the end of the night， you also have to trust。

 in the fact that， it doesn't have to be that， on， and trust that once， you're in a bedroom。

 there's a shift， that'll happen， in your mind。
