因為 mentorship is so valuable， they are willing to give you money， for a percentage of the profits。

 in exchange for mentorship and money， and their mentorship can guide you， open up doors。

 open up networks， Now if you're somebody who doesn't， have a large network。

 and you want to grow that network， and share the network of other successful people。

 maybe investing， could be the right way to do it， I know people have investor relations also。

 because it gives them a massive safety net， that why if you have companies that will say。

 public companies， they have massive amounts of cash flow。

 and they have investor relations departments， because they have it open to anyone。

 who wants to invest this， because they want the cash flow， so that if they have a situation。

 where cash goes down here and there， like by 20%， then basically they have an overall loss。

 from one year， the whole company just match， we doesn't disappear， so I think at that point。

 it's very very healthy， to have that cash and having that savings net。

 because managing the cash flow， especially when you're a growing company， or you're a large company。

 there's a lot of risk involving， you need to have those safety nets。

 you need to have those precautions， in effect to protect the interests of the company。

 because you're not relying on just yourself anymore， you're relying on a lot of people。

 and most people here who are watching this video， are probably not so interested。

 in how to grow a massive global company， or how you manage the complex sophisticated financial。

 infrastructure of some senior corporations， glow international accounts， and stuff like that。

 stuff that I have had to learn how to manage， but I guess the premise and useful knowledge。

 of knowing how investor relations， work and business， could help people。

 who are interested in becoming a business owner， or an entrepreneur， to understand what they。

 shouldn't do， I mean I personally have never got in like loans， corporate loans。

 business to create lines， and stuff like that from banks， because I was able to invest in myself。

 I was able to find credit cards， I would find alternative solutions， and more importantly。

 I was able to find a way， where customers were able to provide， cash to us in advance。

 like deposits for boot camps， and stuff like that， so we could run to the programs。

 and grow the company from the very ground up， so I mean it's possible。

 for a customer-based expansion， to get money to， from other people to grow。

 but be very very careful， because it does come with a cost， and usually that cost。

 is an unknown cost， until you really get to know somebody， usually people， who you work with。

 you'll not really get to know them， until several years of that relationship。

 that superficial first-view meetings， or that deeper relationship， or trying to build with somebody。

 it doesn't really grow deeper， until you really understand， who that person is。

 and it takes a while， seeing how that working relationship is， and even your personal friends。

 your personal friends， that you love and you trust， and have always been had your back。

 these are people that will act very differently， when money comes into line。

 when I was in Project Hollywood mansion， every single bedroom and a house。

 was part of the same company， we're working together as a team， however there was a time。

 a few months later， where every bedroom in that house， was competing company and entity。

 which led to all sorts of conflicts， and eventually led。

 led me kicking out every single person in that house， who wasn't a part of my main core team。

 so that house was just one complete， unified company， one complete， unified mission and vision。

 and eventually eventually， you just got rid of that house， and were able to run things remotely。

 but the learning lessons， of having lived in closed quarters， for such a long period of time。

 is learning lesson， that shows me how people， change when money is involved。

 it changes definitely when you're， in any kind of relationship， where money is involved。

 whether it's a business relationship， but it's a social casual loan。

 that's why I also prefer not to ever loan money to friends。

 it's something that you got to be very very cognizant， money changes people because it's a symbol。

 it's a symbol of resources， it's a symbol of worth， and it's a symbol to a lot of people。

 for access and a change of life and pace， and when people view those things。

 you have to be careful that they're not the kind of people， that forget about your friendship。

 and forget about how they should have a unified goal and mission。

 with you。
