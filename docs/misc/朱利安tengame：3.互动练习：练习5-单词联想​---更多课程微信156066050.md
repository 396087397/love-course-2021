 there's no words to pick from， okay so make it a good length， and you can't pick the last word。

 okay， it's kind of like a mind-fuck-type of exercise， you're like。

 and then try to keep it going as smooth as f**king possible， if you get a good hang of it。

 try to go faster， okay， and this is not one sentence each， it's one guy for 30 seconds to a minute。
