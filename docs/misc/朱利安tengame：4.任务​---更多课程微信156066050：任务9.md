我一向都在你，我一向都在你，我一向都在你，我一向都在你，我一向都在你，我一向都在你，這是主流音樂， Welcome to Mission Number 9，OK。

 now with this mission here， you can slow it down，OK， you don't have to go out。

 for the next 70s straight， you can recuperate， relax a bit， recenter yourself。

 and you only have to go out once，OK， that's it for this week， you only have to go out once， however。

 that one time， that you do go out， I want you to surrender to the night， OK， so what does this mean？

， You're going to go out， Thursday， Friday， or Saturday， OK， one of those busier nights。

 and instead of just， going for an hour， or maybe just going out， and the bar closes。

 or the club closes， or a little tired， you're like， oh， you know， I did well tonight。

 I'm going to go home， and there may be those opportunities， but you just don't feel like it。

 and I see this all the time， someone will go out， it's the end of the night， there's a girl。

 and they're like， well， do I really want to， spend another hour out。

 I don't even know if something's going to happen， plus she was like an hour away。

 it doesn't really seem like a sure thing， and I'm tired， oh， and I have to wake up tomorrow。

 all those excuses pop in， and you just， again，， leave all these opportunities on the table。

 it happens all the time， so for this one night， you're going to go out。

 pretty much for the entire night， OK， I don't care if those excuses pop in， you're out。

 and you're surrendering to the night， and you're putting yourself in。

 the situations where something could happen， OK， so if you live in an area， where， you know。

 the bars clubs close at 2 a。m。， the rule is you're out till 4 a。m。， no matter what， OK。

 unless obviously， you pull and make something happen before， but if not， you are out until 4 a。m。。

 minimum， I don't give a fuck if you're tired， I don't give a fuck what your excuses， 4 a。m。 OK。

 so you really don't have a choice to route， and say the clubs closing at 2。

 and there's all those girls， instead of you， I'm just going to go home， you have two more hours。

 unless you pull you have two more hours out， OK， if she lives an hour away， go with her。

 because you have two more hours out， if you live in an area， where the clubs close at say 4 or 5 a。

m。， you're out till 6 a。m。， OK， so you're either out till 4 a。m。， or you're out till 6 a。m。。

 no matter what， for that one night， OK， and it's really， surrendering to the night， and again。

 being open to， whatever could happen， OK， it's not this little one hour session。

 it's not you going home， at the end of the night， it's you staying out all night， OK， you will see。

 doing this exercise， polling will be a very realistic possibility， you're going to want to pull。

 because you don't want to stay out， in the street from， you know， two hours。

 and all those little excuses， you usually have will just， disappear， OK， so I want that one night。

 surrendering to the night， I want you to post a report， in the Facebook group。

 and the goal is make it up， OK， it's either an epic poll， or it's an epic， you know， a few hours。

 of you just hustling， and trying to make it happen， but I want an epic， fucking story。

 posted in the Facebook group， that's the big one， for this week here， OK， I also want you to read。

 a book， the book is Letting Go， by David Hawkins， that's your reading material， for this week。

 this goes hand in hand， with the diving， into your subconscious， bonus webinar。

 as well as the Letting Go video， that was posted below， so if you haven't seen。

 that one click in the menu， Facebook， or down to diving into your subconscious， read the book。

 Letting Go by David Hawkins， this in my opinion， goes far beyond just， successive women。

 probably the most， life-changing book， that I've ever read， highly recommended。

 so that's your reading， material for this week， since you're only going out once。

 and I also want you to write， a report， OK， zoom out， take some perspective， and write a report。

 on your progress， so far， OK， from， let's just say even the start， of you， getting into 10 games。

 the past eight weeks， what were the major take， ways， or some of the highlights。

 what were some of the challenges， zoom out， write a report， give yourself props。

 and the last thing here， to make it a little bit fun， I want you to go out， in a crowded area。

 say during the day， outside in the street， maybe a crosswalk， or something。

 where a lot of people are walking， I want you to stand， as if you know， in a star position。

 with your legs out straight， your arms out straight， like full on star， and with that position。

 I want you to yell out， for one minutes， your report， your big take， ways。

 from the past eight weeks， of applying， 10 games， embracing， that social pressure， there。

 so to recap， this week you only have to go out once， over that one time， you're surrendering。

 to the night， if you live in an area， where the venue is closed， at two-year-old， till four。

 if you live in an area， where they close later， you're out till six， and I want you to write。

 an epic report， in the Facebook group， number two， I want you to read， the book， and go。

 by David Hawkins， number three， I want you to zoom out， and reflect， on the past eight weeks。

 of applying 10 games， over the big take， ways， what did you learn， and number four。

 I want you to go out， in the public area， stand， you know， this is a star fish， pretty much。

 and yell out， for one minute straight， those take， ways， those lessons， in-pracist。

 or for pressure。
