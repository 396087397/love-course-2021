什麼是很重要的？，我認為什麼是很重要的？，Tower是他很想做一個人的活動，我認為他很想做一個人的活動，在一個人的經驗上，Tower很想做一個人的活動，在這個人的生活中，我也是想做這個活動。

Tower很想做一個人的活動，但是他的活動的活動是很重要的，我的活動是很重要的活動，我覺得我認為 most people wanna make that impact in life。

 They wanna be remembered for something， They want to have a legacy， Even if it's just a memory。

 for a certain period of the time after you are gone， A lot of people wanna admit that。

 I think a lot of people or motivation， is just make an impact in their own lives。

 and that's what they will say to themselves， but they wanna help other people。

 I have really successful friends， that said they never even think about that legacy。

 and I think that's， that might be true，但我本身反映别错，这就是在自私身之中的，因此全数题， natural desire 地狡 Vi 让自己财光，令他平均。

I think also it comes from a sense of adventure and exploring，so I can know what life has to offer。

I would hate to have a situation where I'm on my deathbed。

 I'm thinking back and I am not knowing what happened more than anything else。

I wanna test the boundaries of the possible， in business i've tested it continually by seeing how far I can float this company and grow how fast。

 and sometimes it's too fast， we have to slow down，我來 automatically slow down，我準備�וק義 將大概怎修學。

 So i want these natural gold to stop injustice， What for what i believe is injustice。

 Especially if it's happening to my local friends and family， I am not， So far blown。

 That i've helped my family， And my friends， So much that i want to invest in random people。

 Like it say， I go to， The Ivy coast， And， Volunteer my time to help those people。

 I think it's kind of cool if they are really into that。

我現在只是 trying to help focus on those people that have affected my life。

 or those people that have short low teeth to the causes that I've believed in。

 and making sure that they're not ingest we treated。

 because that happens quite frequently being the CEO of a highway controversial company。

 and I have more than enough ingestuses to try to stop and work on and grow this company。

 to take us to the next level。， The goals of my friends though are usually the same goals that I have。

 because I want to help my friends to seat。， So I will do whatever I can to find out what my friends' short-term and long-term goals are。

 and make sure that they actualize。， I will put full force the power of RSD to make sure that that happens。

， Most of my friends though are RSD students and RSD instructors and staff。， On the other hand。

 rest of them are just random business owners。， They are on a very similar path to me。。

 It's just that they're not involved with the business selling pickup。

 they're not involved in the selling of widget A， B and C。， And also the goals of my family。。

 My family motivates me to seat because I want to help them。。

 These are people that I've been caring about me since I was a little kid。

 and I will do whatever it takes to make sure it's accessible。， So far。

 I've blown that I will literally fly across the country， just to go to my family members' birthdays。

， Even if I'm in like an international country，， if I had a situation where there was a birthday dinner I need to go to。

， just a dinner， just to support。， I flew all the way from London to Iceland to California to fly to that。

， Just to fly to dinner before I need to fly back to Europe and continue my work。。

 Because I view that work as usually second to the friends and family that you have。， But then again。

 work for me now involves me working with people， who I also view as friends and family。。

 I view Tyre， I was more of my brother than I view him as like a friend or a business associate。

 because I know that he views me in a very similar way。， And I think that when you have that mindset。

 I think it's really valuable。， You look at a lot of movies。。

 And movies have had a huge profound impact on me。， Learning about things。。

 I've learned a lot about managing difficult situations with business，， with the community。

 with high level individuals， with a lot of power，。

 from watching how people deal with similar kinds of people in movies。。

 Not because I believe that movies are real，， but because I believe that a lot of people who make movies do a lot of research。

 before they create the movies， and they try to portrays accurately as possible。

 what would be like if you were in those situations。， So I'll watch a movie like Fast and Furious。。

 And one of the main characters is a guy who continually says，， I don't have friends。

 I only have a family。， And that's a huge motivating value that I have in my life。。

 It's kind of another value that is shared with like Mafia movies。。

 And although I don't believe in criminal activity and dissemination of things。

 that can hurt society overall， I believe in helping society overall，。

 but I believe in those family values。， And extending that and being motivated by the ability to help those people。

 that I considered being part of that family，， that not necessarily a natural family。

 but the RSD family。， I think that these are mindsets that have motivated me。。

 Now I know that on the other hand， I think a lot of people can take some of these values。

 and utilize them in your life as well。。
