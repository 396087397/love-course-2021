# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：8. 9分 & 10分 游戏：2. How to game 9’s and 10’s – Part 2

一個比時間使慮的至�nen，到臉後會26天，他操身後要慢慢恢復，這些人都會寄出，現在很大碼，喔 為什麼事故，但我都要安心，因此我想要剖在下面，我自己很幫忙，Derek平常在旁簿，原來你願意在後，時光敬。

怎麼會搞的，因為他很大膽，所以我會想起床動，我每天都不用蓄怒，剛剛很大膽，是就會像有很多香港的校底，看見白天想起宰，講起你們朋友，然後她就會說， 我確定，你就給我busier friends。

你是放的朋友，想說，大概 decorations，你朋友，唉 朋友，你朋友，我朋友，然後她就說，你是超ön的，好吧，你知道嗎？，Brunches closing soon，所以，我沒有必要在這裡。

我真的喜歡，我真的喜歡，但我，我 kind of want some eggs， and a moosa，他們有Pomac granama moosa， and light-cheam moosa。

Let's go，Let's go fuck some shit up， and the whole time， your boss will make it， right？。

 and she's like，OK OK， but because you did that justification， she's OK with it。

 but the whole point is this， so if I just fuck the nine， guess what？。

 The easiest way to fuck more nines is， to fuck her friends。

I'm never ever gonna fuck one nine or ten， and then have to re-game the next night。

 to then fuck more， because the hardest thing is to find them， however you fuck one nine or ten。

 how many nine or ten friends do you think she has？， loads。

 so how we more loads than you guys shot all year， so what， so what am I gonna do？， I'm gonna do。

 I'm gonna drive through her network， OK， I used to begin to MLM， that were marketing right？。

 I was at the top of this company， called Vysalis， for a while， it's like a protein shake thing。

 and it taught me some of the best game， things I could ever know， I mean the business was weird。

 but the game shit was amazing， you just literally you meet one or two people。

 and then you have a huge business， because you drove through the network right？。

 same thing is true with game， so once I pull out， I'm like oh hey let's go to brunch。

 the brunch makes me now not insensitive， but cute and charming。

 if I was just like oh hey let's go hang on to your friends， and go eat some food。

 she'd be like why are you doing this？， we got a cuddle， but if you're like oh brunch。

 wave us a Ontario's bitch， then what's gonna end up happening right？， and do light she？。

 light she my most is？， every girl loves light she， I don't know what light she is， but it's great。

 light she my most let's go， and she's like OK let's go， I'm like oh but。

 again I don't mean to be I don't mean to be a dick， but we do got a hurry。

 if you want the wave us a Ontario's， and the girl is gonna you know， cuz I'm not。

 and I'll even I'm kind of crass， so I'll be like you know I got that my most a dick。

 you know I got that my most a dick， and she's like oh my god you're so funny， I go no for real。

 you suck this dick I guess you're my most a， let's do it。

 like I would go like super aggressive with it， and it's just it just makes the whole thing。

 the whole point of me joking like that， being that crass。

 it's what she doesn't think that I'm literally， so she's not calling me out。

 and I'm not literally just trying to， get her and go to this brunch place， just to meet her friends。

 but then once I go hey do you have any friends， you want to bring them she's like。

 god you're so sweet， and I go I know don't hold it against me。

 right I know don't hold it against me， that's it's a really money line there。

 when you're when you're in this situation， but how do you get nine's and tens。

 you fuck one and then fuck all their friends， I've only ever opened or like。

 fucked maximum five tens or nine， maximum five tens of my life。

 right off of just the initial meetup， but my total lake out of proper tens。

 is between 20 and 30 probably， right which， I mean there's no way in my lifetime。

 could I cold approach 30 tens， because I don't know where to go， I don't know where I'll find them。

 other than brunch， from waking up with the original five， nine or tens。

 so then when ends up happening as this， she goes you have a few friends， I go yeah invite them。

 she's like you sure I go yeah of course， invite them it's all good。

 it's comped anyway don't worry about it， like the food's comped， like we don't have to pay for it。

 because I have social proof at the brunch place， because I've been there every Sunday morning。

 for a while， so then I go I'll give you your questions， right so then what happens to。

 how happens is she goes all right， yeah I'll start inviting them I go yeah。

 and even really pretty and even cute， now you you must be the pretty girl。

 of the group so it's a qualifier right， you must be the pretty girl of the group。

 so you don't have any hot friends do you， then what do you think she says， all of it。

 oh my god my bitches are hot， you don't even know， ehh， these girls are super sexy。

 oh my god I'm gonna go slow down， okay I get it， Jesus Christ， I guess you have one hot friend。

 so I'm called off on again by saying one， what does that then get her to say。

 and allow me to have success with， they're all hot but what， she's going to invite more than one。

 if I'm like oh you only have， I get it you have one hot friend， I have more than one hot friend。

 really so I'm gonna go back and forth， and tease her all of my breaks。

 and rapport are going to be about， breaks and rapport is an umbrella。

 catarge for attraction building， all of my breaks and rapport， are gonna be about the fact that。

 oh right fine you got one hot friend， we get it we get it， she said no I got so many hot friends。

 all right fine and fun and brunch， let's see what happens， okay so now all of a sudden。

 I met you know two to eight， it's never usually more than eight， but it's usually at least two。

 two to eight other you know， it's not always nine or 10， but two to eight to 10s。

 and at least half of them are， nine's and 10s， how would you have ever met。

 a nine or 10 that you know， that many that quickly， I don't know if you know another answer。

 then let me know after the program， okay， how do you get to so for example。

 let's say I have sex with this girl， now I'm going to brunch with her other friends。

 how are you able to， kind of focus on other girls， how do she feel when you are。

 gaming with her friends， because I'm a dirty whore， fantastic yeah so no I mean girls look at me。

 like like like girls that are my， girlfriends look at me and they'll， like they'll literally as a。

 fan's a back there， yeah yeah so like he'll see like he， sees the way that I I act around。

 my I mean you'd say my primary， girls a pretty awesome shit right， how how like understanding。

 when you say she is， it's it's it's about as， what， no no say that， stand up and say that louder。

 because what you just said， literally is the next thing I was， going to say yeah so basically。

 just go like， have you met her have you， have you see have you， interact with。

 wow that's very poignant， because that's what it is right， of on the， to the point where sometimes。

 all be hit down girls in， front of her and everybody else， and then she'll just be like。

 eating and then people look at her， guys you know retarded， P。U。A。s will come up to her。

 and like super retarded P。U。A。's， will come up to her and be like， and start questioning the whole。

 situation that's why they're， retarded right and they'll be， like what are you okay with。

 it like that's the stupidest， thing you could say are you， okay with this is this blah。

 blah blah and like she'll look， she'll literally look up and be， like she'll be like let me eat。

 my food like yeah that's just， Luke that's that's just him， that's it that's it that frame。

 you initially came out with， that's what she's attracted to， because I'll only make a。

 girl my primary if she， fucked my last girl， right it's， I if you're going to be my。

 bottom bitch you're literally， going to have to fuck my last， girl bottom bitch is a。

 pit term for your main girl， basically right the is the， only girl that you sleep with。

 that you know you're not， rewarding with sex well I'll， talk about in a different。

 talk that's like way more， aggressive which is you don't， you deny sex to grow I mean。

 this is super manipulative， so don't do it is horrible， I probably shouldn't say this。

 but there's a whole point， there's a whole like， ancillary part of game which。

 is you deny sex to girls， that you're dating sex is a， reward for positive behavior。

 and then you you reward them， and bestow your cock upon， them otherwise it's so it's。

 like really really aggressive， frame control stuff I'm going， to get back to the 910 thing。

 that that's just like a really， good thing what was the if you， get some hours but you said。

 one sentence will buzz it， because I want to hit that， really hard， in my head is like you。

 meet a girl that is nine， and you were end up， having sex and you say， let's go have brunch。

 for me it is crazy that， oh that's good， on the perfect check this， okay cool cool let me。

 remember that right the best， time to ever have sex with a， girl the more the absolute。

 most effective time is a， short window after you just， fucked a girl， the problem is it's super。

 insensitive any guys like， just like fucking flying on， the moon and have crazy。

 testosterone after you just， fucked a girl right， anybody do the stanky， leg， hey。

 who's been on urban， dictionary the most， let's go find out Mr。， Cleveland's the more。

 all right you fucking， dirty stances， yeah sweet， the thing is this if that's。

 just me then they're mad， when I'm not acting like， that which actually causes。

 some problems because when， I'm an associate or go， full of nine's and tens。

 my nine and ten closing， game is so strong that， when I'm an associate， circle full of nine's and。

 tens with a couple that， I'm dating or seen， that the point where I can't， quite like aggressively。

 close in that situation， I end up actually， becoming very introverted， and shy and quiet。

 and people didn't come up， and they asked me they're， like oh what's wrong， and then they get mad。

 like why are you bringing， the energy down and I'm， like， have fun I'm， I'm neutral I'm good。

 and they're like oh yeah， well you're acting， different right now， why are you not doing。

 the Luke thing， and I'm like， what's the Luke thing， you know when you talk， to everybody and。

 and bond with everybody， you know that stuff， that you do the stuff， and I'm like。

 oh dude I just like， I haven't slept in two， days and I was on two， flights and I'm working。

 and I'm kind of just， I'm good I'm just chilling， I'm existing， oh yeah really。

 really it's like it's， exactly I get this argument， at least once every， like seven to ten days。

 where it's like why aren't， you making friends with my， friends with like the。

 really attractive girls I have， because I'm just like， yo I'm just chilling， I don't you want me to。

 you want to put a quarter， in me and dance， I'll dance I'll be a， monkey like that。

 like when I like， emphasize the， that much then it then， they kind of stop。

 but once you pull out of， a girl you are such， in a primal rage， it's great。

 and be else feel this way， and be else game， right after they have sex， it's it's amazing。

 that window is so beautiful， but it's a little， insensitive to like， pull out of a girl。

 and just be like， I got hit the club， I got 20 minutes， before a club closes， are you you good。

 you good， like you need an Uber， or something because， you're not Uber， Lux I'll get Uber X。

 like you good， because I got to get， to the club， because I got like a， 24 minute window。

 till these， pheromones， wore it， wear off， that you just gave me， right， so the thing is this。

 to avoid all of that， when it's a real， solid 9 or 10， I do the brunch thing， every 9 or 10。

 loves brunch to death， and they despise nightclubs， they go to nightclubs， and they like it。

 that nightclubs， but they love Sunday， fun day， they love the brunch， right， it's the biggest club。

 country thing that you can do， is go to Sunday brunch， good， you got it。

 okay it's a whole experience， for an orange， and shitty champagne， right， oh but bellinis。

 and mimosa， they love that shit， okay， I'd rather game on Sunday， only during the day。

 than any other time of the week， or any other time of the night， to get not proper 9s and 10s。

 so to in order to drive， through the network， when I say that's Luke， and when he was just。

 describing that， okay because it was very， poignant what you just said， it's because I flirt。

 ruthlessly with everybody， that's why I try to get girls， into the friend zone， ruthlessly， right。

 ruthlessly， I flirt with them ruthlessly， I'll say things like， holy shit， when you say holy shit。

 to a girl， what do you think she says， what， no， I never mind， I just notice something。

 but don't worry about it， then what did she say， tell me， tell me， it's nothing。

 your areos are amazing， then the girls， like， what， how do you and she like， she looks， like。

 come on， you know， everyone focuses on the nips， but your areolas， they look soft as fuck。

 and then the girl will be like， wait what do you mean， and like a large， percentage of girls。

 will go， what do you mean， and I'm like， this is not my snap， with the Korean， she's a play。

 play made， a cyber girl a couple of years， ago in the red dress， on my snap the other day。

 and then she's like， oh literally on my snap， I go， yeah your areolas are great， and she goes。

 what do you mean， and I go， I just start rubbing my， my finger against her， nipple， she goes。

 oh my god Luke stop， I can't believe you're doing that， and I go I know。

 I'm just testing the areolas， I'm just testing your， resiliency， and I'm not going to sleep。

 with this girl， probably， she's in the pipeline， I'm not going to sleep， with her。

 she's a very solid 10， she's not my 10， but she's a， classic 10， so because I have， experience with。

 tens in general， what do you think， that allows me to do， when I'm with the 10， that's my type。

 close， calibrate， game， effectively， rather than me， hooking up with all， hooking up in flirting。

 with all these random， girls and dive bars， I have a massive， social circle of， 9s and 10s。

 that at least somebody， in this room， would think， holy shit， that's my 9 or 10， I fucking would。

 marry that girl， and if they're my friends， as well， I'm only meeting girls， who are nice， and cool。

 and you know， generous back and forth， so this girl is amazing， she's like， it's a race for me。

 to throw the credit card， down， if like me and her， are both eating， and they're good。

 I paid for everything， we're fine， and it's like， oh， how can I， actually return any。

 of these favors， it's wild， right？， so when I'm doing， these different sexualized jokes。

 when I'm talking about， the area I'm talking about， I'll randomly look， at my female friends。

 and I'll be like， holy shit， and she'll go， what？， like you're， pussy's hanging out。

 and then she'll go， wait， what？， and I go， fucking kidding， you're in pants， you're pussy's not。

 hanging out， don't worry about it， like I'm saying， that girls are my friends， I'll be like。

 oh shit， you're， labias， it's off-center， it's off-till， I don't know what that means， but they're。

 every time， it's like， wait， what？， oh， come on， Luke， go fuck yourself， that's what makes me。

 what he just said， oh， that's Luke， that's just， is what it is， my 74， and I don't discriminate。

 my 74 75， rolled out， valet tendon， at the front， or the lobby， at the front， every time I see her。

 you see me， bringing these girls up， stairs but you， know you're the， special one。

 but I'll say that as， me and the girl， I just had sex， with her， are going to brunch。

 and then she's like， oh， Luke， you're， so funny，， Aslam， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat。

 my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat。

 my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat。

 my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat。

 my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat， my hat，但)，若丁憤懧 то，是所以哪有一道，不知道所要itat，根據這回事晶瑟，要做什麼的？，立即開會，說，幫我動手玩。

手段 起點，那別人會嚇另一聽，然後再一見，今次很多男生看大部分 B。O。， watch，因為我有一個問題，因為我沒有想到，你沒有想到，所以我會想要把我放在房間，因為我希望要讓人知道，我希望讓人知道。

我希望讓人知道，你也知道，我看過我的網路，有時候會有1月1日，7-14天，我希望讓人知道，我希望讓人知道，我希望讓人知道，我可能會有15個月，有時候會有15個月，有時候會有10個月，有時候會有10個月。

有時候會有10個月，然後它們在兩 squat，幾個月，沒有一個，中共國際的礁拜，太多的礁拜，一近段愈小，例如another，就一個幾年，我使用了優勢，我很少有我们，就錯面的朋友，我是小小的，勢。

從前用教導師，已經發生了，以前物章需求，這一個，而是一部， writer，女兒，從前用教導師，在家的時候，吉毅打电歌，本ケング，元应客，没有，钱，那流管，什么，宝贝，我想，特别感意，他得多，逗利，特意。

 she use，我，应该，哪个，信呸，拿，交房，交房，你就是在接受我，就说，:「No， I don't don't…， I can't even do it…， He's like， «No。

 I just need to fuck more girls！」， And then the whole time， I'm just like，， please don't realize。

 Babe，， that your lay count is higher than his。， Because she's freaking out。

 that his lay count is so high。， And I'm just like， Babe，。

 you've fucked twice as many girls this year。， Maybe three times as many as he is。， The whole time。

 I'm just thinking，， please don't realize that，， please don't realize that。， Because she's like，。

 confused how his lay count is so much higher， right？， But they don't care。

 because I am the guy that doesn't count。， If， again，，你會 Write something down for 9-10 game。

Be the guy that doesn't count， Have anybody heard this concept before？， Yeah， I know you have， Cool。

 Dude， I am a Teddy bear with a dildo， Right？， The reason actually I got in like really really good shape。

 About two， three years ago， I feel my Facebook， I had like one and a half pack， One and a half pack。

 compared to like the kega I have now， And like， It was crazy the shape I was in。

 But I wasn't the Teddy bear with a dildo anymore， Which is then when I was just like， Oh， fuck it。

 who cares， Like I'd rather， You know， Carbs， fuck it， But then it was it was a whole thing。

 Where I realized， Be the Teddy bear with a dildo， Teddy bear with a dildo means， Girls want to。

 Talk to you and connect with you， Fuck you and then have no repercussions， Or judgments or shame。

 whatsoever， If a girl fucks you， And she know， The whole tree in the forest example， Right？。

 If a tree you fall down in the forest， And nobody hears it， Did it really fall？， No， All right。

 That's the debate， right？， And that's the thing， And I think I said that expression correctly。

 If a girl fucks you， Nobody ever knows about it， Are there any repercussions from that？。

 None whatsoever， You guys are also focused on attraction building， I am focused on。

 A rousal and nobody ever knowing about it ever， To the point where sometimes。

 I force myself to forget about it， Because when there's no judgment， No shame at all。

 The 10 will fuck a dude who's a fat five， A fat broke five。

 Because he made her very comfortable with the fact that， No one will even know， No one's gonna know。

 I'm not gonna post shit， Like I don't post photos of girls that I have sex with。

 I mean I listen on Snapchat because it's 24 hour away， You know， That's all separate thing， Okay。

 No judgment， Be the guy that doesn't count， When you're the guy that doesn't count。

 Guess how many people want to jump into your U-Army， There's no risk。

 There's no risk in them throwing girls at you， Right？， I have girls randomly at night。

 It's so it blows， It blows people's mind， How many girls knock on my door randomly。

 Throughout the night， And say， oh is Luke here？， I'm uh yeah， What's up， And then they go。

 Yeah I was told by Mike to come， Come see you， He said we would hang out and get along。

 And I was like， oh that's cool， Yeah have a seat， Yeah， I still I got I still have some corn。

 Some corn macarons to pound down in a mangalasi， But Indian foods like my first half of food， Um。

 There you go， Yeah， Bye， Bye， You got a dance like an Indian？。

 You pat the dog and turn the light bulb， Ta-da， Ta-da， Ta-da， There you go。

 I used to I used to love desi girls， Desi， Desi？， Yeah yeah， Desi's an Indian chick。

 And every time I see a desi girl I'm like， Oh desi and she's like。

 Oh my god how do you know what that means？， Oh my god that's a Google search， And she would be like。

 How do you know what that means？， And I go， Oh because I'm an Indian ballie with dancer。

 And she's like， Wait what？， You really？， I'm like， Of course not， Look at me， And then she goes。

 Oh haha I go but really I'm a better Indian dancer， You and she's like， How I go。

 You just pat the dog and turn the light bulb， Ta-da， They just laugh， It's really funny， Um。

 It's a whole bit， I have， But the， You know the fucked up thing is I have a stick like that。

 For every race that I like， With the darker girls that I like。

 I have my path to weave and check your nails dance， I'm like， Yo yo you're super hot。

 But you got to do the path to weave and check your nails dance， And then goes like， Wait what？。

 I go， Come on look at you， You're beautiful， Your weave's great but， Come on girl。

 And then goes like， Wait what？， I go come on do it with me ready， And I'm going like this。

 And I'm patting my weave and checking my nails， My bitch you got to get that shit in place。

 And then they like it this whole thing right， You got to customize all the shit to exactly what you were after。

 And think about it right， When you're doing sticks like that， Things are that funny。

 The you army's easiest fuck， They're begging to hang out with you， Right， Guess what why。

 I've never once focused on my inner game， But how good do you think my inner game is。

 When I'm getting reactions like this from girls， And I'm building such solidification in my life。

 It's amazing it's great， Right？， It's fantastic， I'm facing this wall of time。

 You never talk about that， I got 20 more minutes to talk about 9 and 10 games。

 You guys still cool with this topic？， Yeah， Yeah， I'm out you know you guys bought the exercises。

 So I have to make sure I give you guys really good exercises。

 But I think you guys are liking this topic right？， Yeah， Yeah okay cool cool cool。

 We're still good to do all the exercises， I just want to make sure we hit this hard。

 So I have questions out， How does the topics come about today， Are they included in your products？。

 What are you doing？， Like are you always in the hard ones？， 100% yeah， I wasn't going to like。

 I want to make it super clear like， The clue about RSD is like， Like 100% of the products。

 Do really well， Because you know just because the you know we give all the free content。

 And whatever， I'm limiting it to 1000 sales， I think most RSD products get more than 1000 sales。

 I didn't have a huge build up for my product， Because I was too focused on actually coaching。

 I teach pickup seven days a week， Three and a half weeks of the month right？。

 So I'm more focused on my clients， But all of the topics I'm describing right now。

 Are just deep dives into each one of these topics， So 9 and 10 game。

 I have at least four hours just on how to pick up 9s and 10s。

 So it's everything I've talked about now， You know， 10% of it would sound repetitive。

 But then every topic I've hit， I just go way way way deeper in。

 I also have a thing where every month， Minimum at once a month I have girls that are true 9s or 10s。

 I'm interviewing them， Which you can kind of take it or leave it right？。

 You can't really listen necessarily a girls advice about how to pick up girls。

 But I mean you just kind of can't right？， You can barely listen to a guys advice about how to pick up。

 You know it's a weird thing right？， But I feel like it's still。

 My whole thing is this I want a 360 degree view， I think this isn't a pitch for my product。

 I'm just trying to help you answer that question， 360 degree view of game。

 Meaning I like same nightlays， If I don't get the same nightlay。

 I very rarely I'm still interested in the girl later。

 If I don't hook up with the girl on the second date， I 100% don't care if I hook up with her ever。

 Like it's just， Like when we're like date this girl 3， 4， 5， 6， 7 times。

 We might become friends and we see each other again。

 But if I don't hook up with her on the second date， I mean I failed， I mean next， Right？。

 So yeah I mean the product just dives super deep into each one of these topics。

 I picked 9 and 10 game because I feel like that's something that a lot of guys are after。

 That's their goal， But I feel like guys are going about it the completely the wrong way。

 That's why I kind of ask you guys you know who's going to certain venues。

 Who's doing certain things， Who's creating their own new army， things like that right？。

 You know I've kind of described a few ways to get your first 9 or 10。

 But I feel like a lot of guys will get it， But there's a word here that， At least all of my wings。

 all my natural friends， and all of my clients love which is consistency。

 Even if you might get results once in a while， it's difficult to turn those fleeting results。

 And it's something that's consistent that you have control over， You guys follow？， Yeah。

 So the way to make it so you don't just get like 1-9 falling over there and make your girlfriend immediately。

 Which is the worst thing that you could do right？， Is I guess there's worse。

 But it's not as positive， Okay， that's why I do the whole thing of bringing them to the brunch thing。

 So let me finish that example， And I'm going to have about 5 minutes of Q&A on this。

 And then I go into the hot seat exercises， sounds good？， Cool， So when I bring them to the brunch。

 I'm like， well， right before I do that， I say， oh yeah you bring your friends， Bring your friends。

 right？， And I even make the little jokes， right？， Hey you bring your friends， I'll bring my friends。

 we can all be friends， We can do it together all night， right？， Yeah， the song， And then she's like。

 okay， okay， and I'll just look at her， She's like， okay， yeah， I'll invite my friends and I'll go。

 Right， so one of those， I was like escalated and at some point in there she's going to go， oh， now？。

 And I'm going， if I want to， Yeah， And then she goes， okay， okay， and then she starts texting。

 Or she'll call， or she starts texting， I'll go， I'll wait for the text and I go， oh cool。

 I didn't hear her voice， it's funny， Well， I didn't hear anything， And then she immediately。

 what did she say？， Oh， I texted， I go， that's cool， you know， you know， text messages。

 they barely go through Android， iPhone， PalmTrio， And then she goes， oh， you want me to call them？

 I go， it's your call， And then she goes， oh， okay， and then she starts calling the friend。

 But I also got the text， so she texted and she called her 9 or 10， Man， I got you on the hook。

 I'm railing this shit out of this， It's like a guy who's like， yeah。

 I'm kind of interested in your new product， And then the guy's like， oh， yeah， yeah， hey。

 well let me send you an info packet and get back to me for interested。

 What the fuck is wrong with you？， You want to， I mean。

 take the vacuum cleaner who goes to the guy's door and he's like， hey， let me。

 or the woman's door like， hey， let me leave you a pamphlet about our vacuums。

 And if you're interested， shoot me a message， fuck that shit。

 they open the door and you're vacuuming for two hours while you're trying to sell them， Right？

 It's how it works， So it ends up happy， because the girl's like。

 once I've identified the girl has 9 or 10 friends， Not only am I going to hook up with them。

 but I'm going to hook up with them， then immediately make them my best friend and make it not awkward。

 So then they， I just drive through the network， Again， I've only ever met originally Maximum 510s。

 Maximum， And I rarely will meet a guy who has met more than 5 actual 10s。

 Who isn't a famous photographer or working some industry that causes that， right？。

 But I've hooked up with at least， you know what I say， 20 to 30 something。

 I have to look at my spreadsheet to be clear， but 20 or 30 something like that。

 That's like the creepiest statement I could say， right？ I gotta look at my spreadsheet to be sure。

 So then she's like， okay， so she calls， she texts， because once I have one on the hook。

 I'm going to ensure， no， you're bringing some friends here， We're going to do this， And then。

 you have to， the burden of the pickup is on you， as the male， you have to do all the work， Right？

 It's， I mean， obviously no means no， because it's not so sex， we get all that， right？， But， it。

 the burden of the pickup is on you， it's part of her selection process to say no about the times。

 Now， when she says no， respect it and don't obviously just， fucking pile through it， right？。

 Don't do that， when the girl says no， it's two steps forward， one step backwards。

 it's the Daniel Tosh approach， Do you guys understand the Daniel Tosh approach？， The Daniel。

 anybody， we know the Daniel Tosh approach？ Come on， there we go， we got a few of you， No， okay。

 so we're talking about his kid when he， you know， when he's， you're hitting on a girl， you know。

 you're， you're making out with the girl， then I'll send you start， you know， make out， you know。

 kissing her nipples， you reach your hand in between her legs， and all she tries to， you know。

 say stop， No， doesn't mean no， no means go down， circle on the nipples a few times and come on back up。

 because boy， I didn't raise no quitter， you keep going， You know， and， and， you know why。

 it's because she didn't wear that dress if she didn't want to get fingered。

 You fuck the ugliest girl at the maximum Halloween party， she's an eight， the most hideous， easy。

 sluddiest girl there is an eight， Because solid eight。

 I have infield video of me pretending I know what I'm doing with the camera。

 that's how I got into these fucking things， they use all my camera gear， right？。

 So I got into this event， and I have this like staff pass。

 and I just see some of the hottest girls up there with a Jonas， Nick， I think is in his， Nick。

 I'm so bad with pop culture， Nick Jonas is one of the guys， I get up there。

 I'm like go give me a camera， so I get up there to film him as if I'm a video guy。

 So that I get to go on stage with him， I'm like getting right up in there。

 and so all of a sudden the girls are being sluddi， I get right up in their chili。

 I'm like filming all this shit， and then my film guy， Alex， is filming me， filming them。

 and I'm like， you get this shit， And he's like， why， you're filming， I'm like。

 I don't know the fuck I'm doing， ISO and settings， I don't， I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing。

 I'm just filming it， so that afterwards I can say， oh my god， that looks so great。

 and then she's gonna go， oh， can I see you， And then she's gonna go， oh， can I see it， and I go。

 oh no， the display is broken， I don't have displays break。

 I don't have no idea what I'm talking about， I don't even know if I recorded anything。

 I'm just like this， focus， not， I don't know how to work these fucking things， I'm terrible with it。

 So what do I do though， is I go， oh shit， and then she's gonna go， what。

 you guys see how that's such a big part of this， is getting the buy-in back and forth？。

 Instead of just being like， oh， let me insert this close or see this close， no， it's this buy-in。

 this give-and-take back and forth， so then I'm gonna go， oh there's the SD card， oh shit。

 then what do you think she says？， Oh， what is it？， Yeah， or what， I mean， most of them are like。

 what's that？， Right， so she's gonna go， oh， what's that， I go， oh the photos and videos are on that。

 oh shit， I almost forgot， and then she's gonna go， oh that's cool， Because they， like。

 only 20% of them actually understand what that means， and I go， no， we can act。

 we have to spell it out， right？， We could go watch the videos right now。

 but you just can't see it in the display， what do you think she says？， Instagram， Instagram。

 oh really， we can？ I'm like， oh shit， I don't know if we have time though， because you know。

 I don't know， I don't think we're stamped to get back into this place。， We're all stamped。

 we got fucking wristband， of course we are， I don't think we can get back in。

 immediately she looks at me and goes， of course we can， we have wristbands！， And I go。

 God you're so smart of course， shit！， God you're amazing， you got to be my next wing woman。

 you're my next sister， I love it， you're my buddy， you're my pal， buddy， pal sister。

 they're all disqualifiers， which then lowers the threat of sex。， Do you understand？， Right。

 but I'm just like filming， like， her twerking， and I'm like， go like this， go like this。

 and then she kind of turns， I go， no， no， with your panties， and then she looks at me and she goes。

 I can't do that， you're an asshole， I go， I know it's for the camera though， I'm not even looking。

 look， And then I'll like， half of them will be like， okay， because I'm like， I'm not looking。

 it's not for me， right？， So I'm just being super sexual， but I'm like， sister， my friend， right？

 I'm friends only in all of them， so I can bust out of it later， okay？。

 Then we go back and look at the SD card， and then we fuck， do you understand？， Right， literally。

 I don't know how to work the fucking camera， it's just the prop。

 it's the bit in order to escalate it forward。， And then what do I do， after we have sex？ Hey。

 you want to go to brunch？， You got any friends？， Okay， and then guess what。

 the last thing to say about this is this， because I thought that Michael thing was kind of cool and kind of important。

， I wish I would have told him to call that， actually do that every time， like， you know。

 Michael call this time， that'd be pretty cool。， Do you guys like the events that he just mentioned by the way？

， Yeah， I don't know about any events， I work too much， I either work， eat， have sex， steam room。

 I have like one， I don't sleep。， I got too much fucking caffeine， too much caffeine to sleep。

 let's go to that。， And I don't sleep， I wish I should sleep more， probably a lot healthier if I did。

， Yeah， like， I get straight razor shaves， I eat， I sleep， I go on airplanes， I do pick up stuff。。

 Like， that's like my entire life， right？ I try to get like an hour of basketball in a day。

 that's like all I do in my life。， So how the fuck would I know about all these events and cool shit？

， Does it seem a little bit daunting or exhausting to have to try to find all these events and do it all？

， Yeah， it sucks， I'm not gonna do all that shit， so I make friends with Michael。

 it makes it just core mission in life to get access to these events。

 and then he's gonna do it all for me。， I don't do shit， I didn't get myself the access to that。

 he did。， I make the URME full of connectors， that's the next stage of the URME。。

 If you get the product， you'll see like， it gets really， really advanced， so pragmatic。

 it's almost like too complicated。， It can be too complicated if you want it to be。

 but I'm gonna kinda give you guys a couple little tangible things here， right？， Build that URME。

 tell them all what type of girl you like， get them invested in getting that type of girl for you。

 and then ideally make the URME full of connectors， guys like Michael， right？， Like。

 he literally just called me to yell at me， the original reason why he just called me was to make sure that I'm going to some one of these fucking events in the next couple of weeks。

 and to tell me how shitty it was that I didn't come to the Jamaica thing。， He's like， dude。

 it was just like， like， big fat photographer dudes in bathtubs just having like， eight。

 nine suck of their dick。， It was just， dude， the hotel they say it was called hedonistic。。

 It's a orgy-swinger hotel that they just rented out for this nude model party。， Pretty awesome。

 it's like， yeah， I've been there， right？， It's epic， 1500 bucks， or 1550。， Like。

 I don't know if I've taken a vacation that was 1550 without all the girls。 You know what I mean？

 Like， that's just， for 10 days， all you can eat food and drink。， Like， that's crazy， and hotel。

 that's unbelievable。， So， he literally just called me to make fun of me for me not going。。

 But what ends up happening is， I make friends with connectors like that in my URME， and guess what？。

 He sends me， he dude， he'll send me IG links every day of like two to five girls。

 almost every single day of girls that are like my exact type， like a new cocktail atress。， Like。

 I don't want to go to Marquis every day to find out which new cocktail atress is working。

 that's my type。， He'll be like， no， no， no， no， this girl。

 or this girl just broke up with this nightclub host。， Now's the fucking time。

 And then he'll send me a group chat， like a group text of me and her。， He's like， hey。

 I just wanted to meet， you to meet my friend Luke。 I know you're going out tonight， randomly。

 Maybe he can show you around。， All right， maybe， I guess， all right， let's do it。。

 And then the whole time he's telling her， like， how fucking rich I am， how big of a dick。

 like he's like building me way to fuck up。， And then when I see her， I'm like， yeah。

 I live at a hammock， I'm this and that。， Why， how do you not get laid off that？

 That's why I'm telling you guys， you can get late 89% of the time。。

 They don't leave this shit up to fate， right？ All the exercises that we're going to do。

 and then all the videos that I'm going to show you later，。

 all of that is amazing to make you a more awesome guy。， Do we all want to be more awesome guys？

 Of course。 Fuck yeah， I want to be a more awesome guy， but I also want to do all this shit。， Right。

 you got it？ I want to be fucking sick as shit。 I want to have pneumonia。

 I want to be super sick and be like，， oh， the back is still bound on that girl。， Like。

 I don't want to have to always feel good。 Who cares？

 I want to be like Arthur last night doing the stuff I showed him，， and get laid。

 even though he had this fucking face， like he wanted to be a next like movie theater shooter or something。

， You know， he had this face， like he's just， is that too far？ Okay， we'll pull it back。 Sorry。。

 Fine， the next gay night club shooter， sorry， if that's better。， Seriously。

 I see his face out of the club sometimes， and I want to hide my children。

 I don't have any kids I know about。， And I'm just like， right？ Seriously， you look mad as fuck。

 but what happens？ You still pounded it out。， So good job。

 And he's like one of the world's best chiropractor。。

 And I think all chiropractor is a fucking crooks and crazy people until I met him。

 and then I realized， oh shit， this shit works。， So he's actually really awesome at that as well。

 That's not a paid endorsement。， Cool， cool。 Any last questions about the social stuff？

 Nine in ten game？， Last thing about nine ten game。 You want to fuck nines and tens？

 You purely put yourself in the situation， the high-barred entry of where these nines and tens are。。

 Then after you fuck them， you tell yourself that that wasn't just a cool experience。

 you fuck their friends。， To the point where when I date a girl。

 I make it extremely clear to her that we're gonna hook up with all your friends。。

 That's just the lifestyle that we're gonna have。， You ever heard of MLCR。

 multiple long-term relationships？ MLCR is multiple long-term relationships？， No， okay。

 it means I hear I'm a roster。， Who here wants to date more than one girl at a time and kind of live that lifestyle for at least a little while？

， Then maybe pick your， okay， all of us， right？ Come on。。

 And even if you're looking for that perfect girl， the best way to do that is to date multiple girls at once。

 right？， The way I do that， it's because it's a little bit annoying to have to message these girls and you know。

 you're WMS， right？， You guys know a WMS is？ It's a horror management system。 Sorry。

 a woman management system？， It's a woman management system。 I left Freudian slip my bad。。

 It's a woman management system， right？ So you keep up on with all the girls that you're dating and talking to。

， So what you do is you fuck the nine， this is what I do。 You don't have to do this。

 it might be misogynistic， but what I do is this。， I just find that it's realistic。

 I fuck the nine or ten or eight， whatever。 I fuck the very attractive girl。。

 I then make her in the product， I go into a little more graphic detail about this。

 I'm gonna just say this。， I fuck the girl， I fuck the nine or ten。

 and then I drive through her network。， I create such a fun sexual vibe with all of her friends that I fuck all of her friends。

， Half of them stay friends， half of them can't hurt their relationship with。

 and then they realize that they weren't really good friends anyway。。

 Most of our friends would be honest。 If you really look at it。

 probably aren't the type of friends that we really want long term。， It's just kind of the stats。

 Some of you guys might not be that way， but especially with women。

 you have a data girl and you look at her friends， and you're not insecure about it。。

 You're just like， your friends are fucking retarded。 Why are you friends with them？。

 I see all the time， you're better than all of them， right？ So I fuck all of them， and then I say。

 literally， I make it very clear。， After we fuck them all， some drop off， some come on board。

 but then we fuck more girls together。， Then what I do is， which is the beauty of this。

 is I make all of my multiple long term relationships， my main girls' best friends，。

 so that I don't have to text any of them or keep in touch with them ever。。

 I just make them my girls' new best friends。， When she's sending them memes， hey， what's up， girl？

 How are you？， You want to go get pedicures today？ That's all the crap I would have had to do if I have a real roster。

， I don't want to have to do all that shit。 So what I do is， I have the main girl， the main primary。。

 Fuck her friends。 I bring new girls into our life。 Every new one night stand I have。

 I introduce that one night stand to my primary， and then I make sure I'm。。。。

 You guys have so much in common。 It's crazy。 How did you guys not know each other's whole time？。

 You know what， never mind。 You guys are better friends than you。 Don't steal her from me。

 That's the money line。， You're going to steal her from me， aren't you？

 You guys are going to run off in the sunset together as like a goddamn Taylor Swift music video。。

 I'm not even a part of this。 Am I？ And then all of a sudden they both go， no， girl power。， Yeah。

 yeah， yeah， and they do the whole thing， and I go， alright， fuck， don't get me drunk， though。。

 Don't take advantage of me。 Those pellegrinos are in my fridge are strong。

 I'm addicted to pellegrino。 Those fucking things are strong。， Okay， you know， I'm also that goose。

 that gray goose is strong， too。 So I'm pointing them out。， And they're， oh no， no。

 and then they end up creating that cognitive distance， that banter back and forth。 You understand？。

 And then they become best friends and I never have to text my casual girls ever again。。

 I'll even nickname them days of the week。， Right？ So the girl that， like。

 and the primary loves it because she's in on the bit， right？， So I'll be like， hey。

 are you going to invite Wednesday over or what？， And then she's like， what do you mean Wednesday？

 And I'll be like， look， she's like， look at what？ I go， look， Wednesday is asking what's up。。

 And she goes， who's Wednesday？ I go， Sarah。 Come on， you know， Wednesday， that's when we see her。。

 Come on， we have to demean her a little bit for her to respect us。， And then it sounds fucked up。

 but it works so well。 And then when Wednesday comes， you're like， oh， it's Wednesday。， I go。

 oh shit。 And then she'll come over， right？ That， oh shit， that play back and forth。， You see， oh。

 that's a constant part of the game， right？ Then Wednesday comes to， what do you mean Wednesday？。

 And I go， you don't want to know。 And then she'll go， what？ And I go， now I can't tell you。

 And she'll go， come on， tell me， right？， That back and forth is the participation and the buy-in。

 The hot of the girl， the closer to a 910 that she is， the more buy-in that you actually need。。

 Not value， you need buy-in。 I'll go， oh， we have this thing because we see you on Wednesday。

 We nicknamed you Wednesday。， But what does that imply？

 That you and your girl are fucking six other girls。， Because there's seven days in the week。

 usually。 Right？ So literally， you do the whole nickname， day of the week thing。。

 Now you're doing the Herum roster building， which is what I think most of you guys， you know。

 at some point want to learn。， Which by the way is the perfect way to get a girlfriend， wife， fiance。

 all that shit is because， you know， a relationship that's， you know， recognized by the government。。

 The best way to do that is to have this Herum and then pick from that Herum and then that's the girl。

， It sets everything off in the right path。 There's a bunch of classical conditioning stuff that you can do also to make sure they don't cheat on you and actually have a good way to do it。

， And actually have proper love game in place。 Let's be on the scope of this conversation。

 But if you're curious about it， ask me。 We'll talk about it later。。

 But the whole Friday thing is great because most girls want to do， you know， Thursday， Friday。

 Saturday because that's date night， right？， So when you talk to the， you know。

 you talk to other 9s and 10s that are your main girls friends now。。

 Not only do you not have to message them and keep up with it and try to， you know。

 how many of you guys like are stuck having like text girls you hooked up with once and then you're trying to maintain this whole thing over and over again。

， And it just falls off for you。 The hot of the girl， the more options they have， right？ Well。

 how do you create a stick rate？ You make her new best friend。

 Another girl that you guys are fucking。， Zero Flake rate because they're girls。 They're besties。

 BFF。， Corasion。， Right？ So they're doing all this stupid shit with each other。 All the girls stuff。

 right？ They can do all that girl stuff。 That way I don't have to。。

 They'll go do makeup and lashes and fucking labia shit， right？ They'll do all that crap together。

 So you don't have to。， But think this way because there's such good friends。

 you never have to worry about flaking because they're just hanging on a friendly basis。。

 And then every time you see them， you rail them， you go away and now they get to do the friend stuff。

 It's crazy。， This is like the biggest thing I think that's very like Luke game that I've never seen a BL's do where you just。

 you pound out the friends and then you make that the roster building， right？。

 That's how you get real minds tens into your life consistently， not just sporadically。， Yeah？

 Do you guys like that？， Yeah， cool， cool。， Shit。， I just called one of them actually accidentally out of it。

 Horrible。 You heard all that。， That's funny。 Do you guys know about my phone trick too？， Oh。

 and loves my talent， which one？ Someone said yes。 No， my phone trick。 You guys know what is it now？。

 Yeah。 What's the phone trick？， I love when I ask a bunch of people say yes and I ask what it is and I suddenly it's crickets。

， Okay， let me tell you a phone trick， right？ I have a bunch of phone tricks。

 but this one's really going to tell you very quickly。， After you fucking 9 or 10。

 ideally a couple times。 You can fuck any quality of your world at this point， right？。

 But specifically with 9 or 10 game， this definitely has to get omitted from the video。， So omit。

 This is horrible。 Afonso， you know about， I totally do about my phone thing， right？， No。

 I was talking。， With the， when they're sleeping， I think Owen makes me tell you guys all the time。

 I think he loves that fucking thing。， What's your topic now？， No， no， no， that's fine。 I just。

 I really just want you to use it。 This one's super dvs。 It sounds horrible， but you fuck，。

 did you know this？ Have I told you this？ Yeah， it's amazing。 Dude， this one is money。 So money。

 It's so good。， I mean， this one's so good。 So I fuck a girl who was 9 or 10。

 ideally you fuck her a few times，， we're like， you have a little bit of trust。

 I've also done it where you have no trust， but I don't even know the girl's name。。

 That's a little bit harder because when she finds out what you did， she gets really mad。。

 If you're dating a girl for a little while， she finds out what you did。 It looks super needy。

 but also kind of cute。， So it works really well。 If you have enough attraction。

 any bit of neediness by the way is just cute and endearing。。

 The only problem with neediness is when you're needy before you have attraction。， Seriously。

 if you have a track， if you're， if you have the exact physical type that a girl likes and you're super needy。

， the girl's just like， he's so sweet。 Amazing。， But if the girl doesn't like you。

 you haven't broken her poor you， you haven't built attraction。 She's like， you。

 get the fuck away from me。， The only difference between what？

 A stalker and a girl that a guy that a girl likes is how attractive it is。， If you're that quote。

 it's crazy。 So my phone trick， sleep with a girl。 I pull all nighters twice a week。。

 Probably not healthy， but it works really well for this trick。， So I'll stay up。 Girl falls asleep。

 I grab her phone and I basically have already found out which girls are attractive。。

 I'll look at the image or whatever。 And I'll start texting girls in her phone。

 You can hate me for this， but it works very well。。

 It's gotten me at least 40-50 girls just off this one bit。

 Probably close to 55 lays off this in the past year and a half， two years。。

 Just off this one technique alone。 I have to check my sheet for this。 But you take the girl's phone。

， Real quick。 Real fucking quick。 You take the girl's phone。 You take the girls that are attractive。

 Ideally， you meet a couple girls in the club that night with your girl。， You do the Snapchat thing。

 You playfully banter back and forth。 And then you get them to exchange snaps， which is super easy。。

 Basically， they'll just exchange anyway。 And you kind of just make note of the names of these girls。

 When the girl's sleeping， go into her phone。 This is horrible。 Make me sound like a dick。。

 I wish I could just have that on an audio bite on the video。 I like it。 I really like it。

 I just put that at the end of anything I say。 It would just make me sound more credible。。

 I go into the girl's phone。 And I text the girls， hey， I was too shy to tell you this earlier。

 but I actually think you're super cute， wink。 Send it。 And I just wait。。

 And the first time I did this， I was shitting a brick。 I was like， I was like， soup。 God。

 this is what I think I first did this in New York City。， There was a hotel room that I demolished。

 I got banned from hotels tonight from this room。 I got so mad at the girl with this huge fight。。

 And I just like went crazy on this hotel room。 And I'm so weird with hotel rooms。。

 And I remember being mad。 I was like， what do I do here？ Well， the nightclubs are closed。

 even in New York is not 24 city。 What if I fuck her friends？ That'd be cool。。

 So then I go into her phone and start texting all of her friends。 Like a really close friends。

 And I was like， hey， I would do things like the first text。 I maybe like 15， 20， these texts。。

 Oh my God， I've been thinking about this for a really long time。 I don't know if I can tell you。

 I just let it hang。 Super friendly generic to get that back and forth。 Then immediate。 The girls。

 I'll tell you what， girls don't flake on each other with texting。。

 And you know as much as they'll flake on you fuckers。 So and these are all， I mean， again。

 these are all， I'm trying to do this all with nine tens， right？ You know。

 I was pretty horny at the time。 So I think I definitely dropped below nine on this one。

 But I did this maybe， you know， like I said， 15， 20 girls。， And I'm just like， what the fuck？

 I had no idea。 I never had gotten messages that were this good before。 The girls start going。

 oh my God， me too。 I've always had a crush on you。， And I start being like， what？ These bitches are。

 don't communicate at all。， And they don't communicate。 So then I'm like， wait。

 this is going so 100% of these went well。 So I， do you think I just like ended it there？ I was like。

 oh， that's kind of funny。 I then I rolled over into bed or I rolled with it。。

 I drew a bath for myself。 I put a little bath bomb in there。 And then I， you know。

 I made a little bit of tea for myself。 I got very comfortable。 Yeah， I mean， tea。 Let's be real。

 It's like eight red bulls and， you know， I got a bunch of my bare hands and shit， right？。

 So then I sit in the bathtub and I go， let's have fun with this。

 So I just start texting them all as if the girl who's sleeping was just madly in love with all of these girls and just couldn't express herself。

 She just， she just couldn't do it。 But today's the day for it to finally let them all know it。。

 And I'm just flirting。 I'm getting like nude scent， like crazy nude photos。

 Girls will send each other crazy nude photos way better than they'll ever send you。， Well， I mean。

 I take this really far。 It sounds bad。 Oh， I happen to have a bunch of nude photos of these girls that I'm sleeping with。

 And so I even send， I remember like the last time it this it worked so well。

 I took a picture of like my girls like like stomach area where it's like sexual but like safe。

 And I sent it to where I go。， I go like I just said， do you like my progress？

 I'm working out for you。 Oh my god， I can't believe I just said that to you。

 And then the girl was like so much more fun by the way to flirt as a girl because like the response is so much better。

 It's amazing。， So they're like， oh my god。 And then like she'll send a picture of her butt and be like。

 I've been doing squats。 I just can't believe you said that I've been thinking about this for so long。

 I just， and obviously you start realizing how many girls are in love with the bad。

 They don't need us at all。， They're just madly in love with each other。

 And I'm getting these messages back。 And I， my， my bath is getting cold。

 I've been in this bath for two and a half， three hours。 I'm like， I draw another bath。 And I'm like。

 man， how much longer time I grow wakes up。 This is crazy。 Beautiful mind。

 Just laying in the bed there。， And you know， in one hotel tonight and then my other， you know。

 the other hotel's nice across the street。 So I have to get back to her in a little bit as well。

 And I'm， and I'm like， what am I going to do？ How do I， like she's going to see all these messages。。

 So I quickly send all the nudes to my phone。 Because I'm a guy， you know， that's what。

 that's what we do。 And then I send a message saying， oh my god， I can't believe we。

 we really got all this out there。， You're just really cute though。

 Let's talk about this later and put this on pause。 And I delete all the messages。 Quickly。， Quickly。

 because then they get one message back and I leave that unread， which is， oh my god， you're right。

 I do think you're cute。 You're actually really beautiful， but you're right。。

 They send something kind of like that， which is a little bit vague， but it's a beautiful compliment。

 Just， oh， you are kind of cute。 That's the beauty of it to get that message back。。

 But I've deleted everything else except for the one message and I make sure it's unread。 Right。

 So then I close the phone， put it back， you know， wherever it was before。

 And then I go to bed and I wake up。 And then the next day she goes， wait， what happened last night？。

 I go， what do you mean？ Making some coffee。 I mean， mom。

 I'm super fucking tired or I haven't even slept yet。 I'm like， I'll prune from my bath。 Right。

 That's how I was。 That sounds。 And then I'm like， I don't know。 And we know I'm just like。

 look at all my dudes。 I'm just like， oh， fuck， yes。， And then I was like， yo。

 Stacy just said I'm really cute。 And she misses me。 I go， hey， maybe she'll roll with it。

 See what happens。 And she's like， no， I can't。 That's Stacy。 I go， hey， it's just for fun。 You know。

 we already have， you know， this other girl， this girl just rose to happen。。

 I doubt she had me saying that maybe even a wrong text just fuck with her。 Like just tease with it。

 The best line is just fuck with it。 And then she goes， okay， fine。 I think you're cute too。

 And she just starts all back up again。 But she thinks the other girl。

 the beauty of this whole thing is she thinks the other girl prompted this in the first place。

 So I'd lead all the messages。， Go for it。 I mean， Recombro， my best friend did counterintelligence。

 I got all that shit。 I mean， I can hack any of your phones。 The first， I mean， like， I mean。

 I did pen testing security testing for quite a long time。

 Anybody like do pen testing or CCNA service？ Wow， that's crazy。 No geek。。

 What's Microsoft CCNA is Cisco。 Fake geek。 I'm a。 You do you literally like here's the thing， bro。

 I mean， here， if you're if you're a very normal guy and you want a very trustworthy relationship just you and your girl have kids。

 white picket fence。， Then never looking your girls phone。 She'll never looking， you know， I mean。

 she'll looking yours， but you know， pretend that she'll never look in yours。

 And it's it's a very trustworthy kind of situation。 You want to you want to I mean， he's the thing。

 I always tell the girl that I'm doing this eventually。， Because then they're just like you fucker。

 And then eventually what does that add to that's just look。 Right。

 You got to break a few eggs to make an omelet。 The point is not to lie to her。

 That's not I'm not trying to deceive her。 Right。 The real immorality with infidelity is dishonesty。。

 I have a main girlfriend。 But I pound out what's up。 Yeah， I have a main girlfriend。

 but I like that doesn't slow my game down at all。 You should all have a man and a secondary and they should all know about each other。

 Just don't throw it in their face。， And you can see a guy without a man that's that's you know。

 and without a main and without you know， proper same like kind of strategy or whatever you know。

 whatever it is I'm like。， And because he's like， I'm just looking for the one。

 I'm not into that game stuff。 I'm sure get married。 I'm like， well。

 how are you going to do it without the structure？。

 There's no way I could actually ever get the type of quality girl I want if I didn't have this structure in place of doing all this。

， So after doing this， you know， a few times， a few weeks， you know， maybe we'll go up to that girl。

 maybe we won't or whatever。 But the girl's already primed and ready。 You know。

 the girl will almost always find out。 So kind of catch me。 You know。

 she'll catch my hand to the cookie jar。， And then she'll be super mad about what the fuck so disrespectful。

 I'm like， I know I can't help myself， but she is kind of cute though， right？， Come on。

 look at that ass， though。 And then she's like， oh my god， yeah， she is having a nice ass。 I'm like。

 come on。 You know you wanted to eat that booty like groceries。 Oh my god， don't say that。 Like。

 for real， it's the song。 I'm just using。 And the girl's like， yeah， okay， haha， she is cute。。

 And then then you're all with it， right？ Does it make sense？ Cool。 Go for it。

 I'll do two or three questions on this。 And then we go aggressively in these exercises。。

 When you started out， you said you had a big argument with her。 Everyone listen to him。 Come on。

 listen， go for it。， Okay， when you started， you said， hey， we had a big argument。

 destroy this hotel。 So then that night， did you lay her or you just had a fight and she just knock out。

 then you went into her。， But that fucker， then I fucked her with either in the morning or that night。

 for sure。， But my sexual girls that I'm with are very 50 shades of gray agreement oriented。 So。

 yeah， I don't like to talk about too much in like a， like a discussion。， But you know。

 if we know each other longer， I'll explain all of that。 So， yeah。

 definitely pounded out several times for sure。， Okay， so， sorry， I may love fornicated。。

 But the fight was after she found out that you text or you know， that was a different。

 that was a different fight， but that wasn't a fight。 The fight was earlier。， Yeah。

 I mean with my main， I'm super controlling and possessive。 Extremely controlling and possessive。。

 Because I know， you have heard the expression， I know what I bring to the table。

 so I don't mind eating alone。， Yeah， it's one of my favorite expressions。 I mean。

 I know what I bring to the table。 I know， I know what， what dating me is like is， I mean， it's。

 it brings in some pretty awesome privileges。， So， I have a lot of demands in exchange。

 I'm just very honest with the demands back and forth。

 The problem is if you're controlling and possessive and you have a lot of hidden demands or insecurities。

 then it's bad。， But if you're controlling and possessive just because you know what's right for you and her and you just know best because you're the man。

 then there's no problem。， You know， it allows， you have to， you have to read David。

 the fuck's that guy's name？ Dieda， Dida， whatever， Dieda， yeah。 Wave's a bigger man。

 As simple as that book is， that shit's a， that shit's gold。。

 You gotta be the rocks so she can be the storm around it。 You have to be the point of stability。

 Even if you're an emotional mess， guess what？ Guys， we're more， we're way more emo than girls are。。

 Especially 9s and 10s。 We are so much more emo， dude。 We're so sensitive。 We want to be like， yo。

 fuck off， bro。 Pro team spelled right。， Where's the， where's the age you do with the muscles？

 Is it you？ Yeah， right？ Like all of a sudden he's like， yo， pro ma， give me some protein， pal， hey。。

 Right？ We want to be all tough and shit， but in reality we're just like， oh， we just want a friend。。

 You know what I mean？ Like seriously， most dudes are way more sensitive than girls are。

 Girls are so strong and that's what I love about when they're really strong。。

 Do they go through a lot of shit？ What about， what did Betty White say？， The piece of a giant。

 right？ Like， what is it？ Yeah， you're not a dick。 You're not a dick because dick's sensitive and soft and weak。

， What you should say is be a vagina or something， right？ It don't say you have balls。。

 You have balls。 Balls are weak and sensitive。 But pussy's can take a fucking pounding。

 I thought that quote， that's a hilarious meme， right？， Yeah， the fight was about some other shit。

 So meaning like， this is earlier in the relationship with this one and I。

 this was my current primer in my last， my current one。， And it was a whole。

 I just demand a lot of respect。 I mean， it's， as I read the iceberg slim。

 I just remember every iceberg slim。， Yeah。 This is my hood dude up here。

 He understands all the shit I'm talking about， right？ Yeah， yeah。 He's like， deta， up。， He's like。

 oh， Cliff， let's do it。 No， I mean， I read iceberg slim is like my relationship game type stuff。

 which is， you know， it's questionable if you actually want to do it。， I mean。

 iceberg slim is a pimp kind of thing， right？ But women， I mean， here's the thing， like what women。

 attraction is not a choice。， Right？ This is the best guy， David Angelo quote， right？ It's the only。

 like， the best thing that that dude has ever put out。 Under David Angelo。

 I've been paying against a genius， right？， It's his real name。 Fucking genius。 Like what， make 30。

 40 million a year if he makes something like that。 Brilliant， brilliant guy。 Yeah。

 and then look at his wife， right？， Look at his wife and then tell yourself that money matters。

 She's like a decrepit， like， like skeleton of a woman is with short hair。 It's crazy。， But no。

 I mean， David， David， the actual attraction is not a choice。 It's so true。 Ask a， fuck。

 the next girl you have sex with， a girl you're currently dating。， You made it。 Nice。 Yeah。

 This guy like attended 30 minutes of yesterday， and at the very end， he's like， you know。

 so I was really late。 But would you mind like just kind of give me a good， like， decent。

 like detailed summary of everything you just talked about？， I wish you would have told that to Owen。

 He would be like， what？ What？ He would have gone into it。 Super， super funny。
