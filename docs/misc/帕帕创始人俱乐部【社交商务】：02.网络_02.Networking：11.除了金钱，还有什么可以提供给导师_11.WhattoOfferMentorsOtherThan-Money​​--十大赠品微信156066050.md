因為 even mentors， people that have a lot of value to offer， they can use mentoring themselves。

 everyone can。， Everyone needs guidance。 Everyone has an。

 and his success knows that they need to have an open mind。

 because there's always new opportunities in front of them that they should take advantage of。。

 And usually you want to make these events fun。， So I always try to organize fun events and now combine the business events to more fun activities。

我是凸了冰 Waitress，我oltI used to have events where I'd have private chefs， From a very famous restaurant。

 He would come down and cook for everyone， and have a magician come， and have a hypnotist come。

 and have people just providing entertainment for my crowd， And corporate sponsors do wine tastings。

 just organizing one event， could be a part time job， for several months in a row， as a result。

 it requires unique skill set， requires the time and dedication， doing so。

 a lot of planning needs to go involved， and so you need to start， you can start small。

 or you can start big， I've done both， I've taken time off， where I haven't organized events。

 in a long time， and now I know where I just organized something， just because。

 you know I was like what the hell， it's try it out， I think that， giving access to mentors。

 to have them meet people， more and more than anything else， is probably the most powerful thing。

 that you can offer mentors， the challenge that you face， is that in order to meet the mentors。

 there might be a lot of time， and if there's not time or time or time， there's a lot of resources。

 like money， so the question is， you know how can you offer mentors， more than just money。

 well sometimes， you could do these ancillary things， but when it comes down to it。

 it might cost money， just to gain access， to these mentors in the first place， sometimes it is。

 especially some of the most powerful people， but at the same time， if you are willing to invest。

 in this kind of a mentorship， you're going to value it more， people who just get advice for free。

 usually don't value it， as much as if they pay for it， they take that advice seriously。

 and as a result， it's an investment in their future， having a company， like an educational company。

 a business company or service， one of the things that they always say， is you know。

 if you're paying for the service， it's more of an investment than an intuition。

 I think that's why people were selling business mentorship， have the easiest time selling it。

 because it's an investment， if you could actually turn it into dividends。

 and then you can't even go profit on the back side， and that's why so many people enter。

 the business mentoring thing， for us we wanted to create a real product。

 service that provided self-improvement， and dating advice and pick up。

 and we just didn't want to be a company， it was known just for teaching business。

 for just a business， but at the same time， our customer base wants to improve。

 and we should talk about that social circle development。

 and combine it all together and create a program， that's what we wanted to do。

 because I definitely can be a mentor， for all these things， in any process of mastery。

 as most mentors， who have one side of their life， that's successful， usually have many。

 if not all of the other lives， parts of their lives， more successful than most other people。

 so yeah， if I'm me myself having a ton of mentors， I'm always seeking ways。

 to go deeper with my present mentors， I used to， continue to seek new mentors。

 now I'm just trying to go deeper with my present mentors。

 but it's not like I'm always gaining mentorship anymore， I kind of am well established。

 with what I'm doing， but for those of you who don't already have， that regular accountability。

 and it's someone who could be your mentor， these are some of the things you can do。

 to get the proper mentorship， and you can take you to the next level。
