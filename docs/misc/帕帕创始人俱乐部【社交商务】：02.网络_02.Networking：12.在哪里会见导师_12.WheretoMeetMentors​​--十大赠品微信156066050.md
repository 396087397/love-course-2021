那將為你رة後，全世界要多低，以及大家倆在ей哥，每次在那集，市場所基礎，生活在這代行，與他們和我的旅館，导演一台，行不行，我awork，而且是一般同學，做特性 heat，限制，自小，8元，改。。

dab，amel，激科， Aber， Bombay，是默契的默契，人家 who studied really hard，人家 who are dedicated at hard work ethic。

我認為 that universities are really just more of a filter。

人家 who have a hard work ethic for particular thing， to accomplish a particular goal and get together。

 and of course they get accomplished good and amazing things， In fact。

 I know that some investment banks that offer tons of money， to people who work for them。

 don't even care what you studied， if you just graduated from one of these top three universities。

 because you proved that you had a hard work ethic， and it makes a lot of sense。

 because more important than anything else in business， that's what is useful。

 Now in terms of like my social circle， I even had friends that I even would pay to go to dinner with me。

 and I'd invite them out for dinner and lunch on a regular basis， just to like ask for advice。

 and we were just going out to hang out， I wouldn't be the one treating， but I would treat dinner。

 treat lunch， just if I could just pick their brain， and do on a regular basis。

 and just inviting friends out for that kind of experience， is one of the easiest ways to get mentor。

 since it's not that expensive just to do that， it's probably the cheapest way to do that。

 in terms of like using money， but it's a social gathering situation。

 I did that for somebody who was a mentor， who was so proud of my success。

 he now lectures about the success that I was able to inspire。

 especially because one of the extra correctivities I did。

 was involved with a group called the NASA Reduce Gravity， student organization。

 it's an organization for students around the world。

 it doesn't exist anymore but if you applied for a grant， NASA would give you a grant to fly a plane。

 to zero gravity， do parabolas and science experiments， and zero gravity， and I did this。

 and I was able to get great mentors， from aerospace companies by just contacting aerospace CEOs。

 and inventors and say hey look I got this Rural Co grant。

 I love to have your advice about how to do this experiment。

 and that was a way to get great free mentors， because it was just an exciting thing。

 and a lot of people never get asked to be mentored， so I think a lot of people just appreciate that。

 I have friends of family， who have children who are just really interested in getting good mentors。

 and I feel honored sometimes by these kids， they're just like 16-17 years old that are interested。

 in having me mentor them， and I'm more than glad to do so because it's fun。

 now RSD is almost the most obvious place to get mentorship。

 RSD is the place where you get mentorship， exactly what you're looking for and that's why you're here now。

 in terms of daying advice， subactualization， identity level change。

 this is exactly what we're all about， we do that for your social life， your daying life。

 your business life now， the higher purpose cause that is most inspiring to you。

 and we're continually growing that process， yet at the same time。

 if you wanted to get involved with RSD， in terms of finding mentors outside of the instructor。

 RSD nation has a lot of peers， that you form your own mastermind group， and you mentor each other。

 that's what's the power of a tribe， because when you're in a tribe。

 everyone who's a peer could help mentor each other， in fact both the best mentorships。

 come from people who are in the exact same situation， not from people who know more than that。

 at a person that way they relate to each other， and are focused on the exact same things。

 at the exact same time， there's a lot of gurus out there， selling masterminds。

 whether it's in business or social， you'll see them all the time。

 I've paid for a lot of them myself， just to kind of learn the ropes， or how they run their program。

 or just because I'm actually generally interested， in the topic of what they're teaching。

 are companies full of these guys， but they're in all aspects of self-improvement。

 and are all aspects of business， now they're a possible source for mentors， it's not just the gurus。

 you can see on the internet advertising or services， or ones you see on TV like Tony Robbins。

 but just from actual businesses， just from getting involved with working within a company。

 just having a legitimate job， you're going to meet people who are managers， on top of their game。

 you'll meet people who are just coworkers， on top of their game。

 and these people will be your mentors， so you do your job better， and you also learn a lot about。

 pretty much any topic， just from developing more relationships。

 so that's always a great way to get into things， having friends， and all sorts of life。

 is the easiest way to get mentors， in my family， I have really successful people。

 and they actually act as mentors， and that's where advice， I don't really acquire that。

 or really ask for that a lot anymore， but throughout my life， I've gotten that advice。

 for particular situations I know they specialize in， but among your friends， and your social circle。

 you might be honestly surprised， about how much your friends， really know about the world。

 and how much they can take away from you， especially when your situations， lean to relationships。

 and you have a lot of people， surprisingly have been in those situations。

 that you think are very very unusual， and if they haven't been， they have had similar experiences。

 or they could just use their， personal experiences to kind of give you advice。

 about what they think you should do， take it where the greatest salts。

 if they haven't actually been in that exact situation， but strategically they may have。

 the insights， if they're in intelligence， if they're on the ball， they might have the insights。

 and they might have all the time for that， even if they haven't had a situation。

 I'm asking advice about， just because I know that you're just， genuinely smart people。

 and I invest in trusting the ideas of people， and back most people who are investors。

 or invest in bakers， they don't invest in an idea， they don't even care if the idea is。

 they invest in the people， because they know that they're accomplished， whatever they want。

 they have the work ethic， they're going to be successful， you also will meet random people。

 throughout your life， you can just ask random people， for advice if you need help and assistance。

 not like long-term internships， but you could just be in social categories， of cocktail parties。

 of house parties， even nightclubs， bars and clubs， you never know。

 when we first were picking up girls， one of the most common picket lines。

 is getting in a female opinion， actually could be a good way to get advice。

 you don't know who you're getting advice from， but it may inspire ideas， even if the advice is bad。

 it happens， and it works， I think that any kind of social setting， can inspire。

 period of mentorship， so you could pretty much get mentorship， from anyone。

 sharing ideas in and of itself， could be mentoring， they might be formally organized。

 and they might be getting trained for mentors， and I have mentored entrepreneurs。

 through organized structures， and business structures， and also have done it for soulful things。

 for business， personal and family， I think that's a lot of value， I think that it's also。

 because I've invested a lot of money into that process， and I'm firmly believe in that process。

 of mentorship， so if you're interested in finding mentors， these are some of the places to go。

 and if you're really into one of these particular things， and it works for you， that's great。

 and if not try another， because they're everywhere， there's an overabundance of people。

 who want to be mentors as well， don't worry about finding mentors。

 just worry about finding the right mentors， because you should seek knowledge， from those mentors。

 that really know what they're doing， and also are continually learning， because no matter what。

 no matter what you're trying to get advice on， the situation and the playing field。

 the situation and the playing field。
