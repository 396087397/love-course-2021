我們，我們會回答一些詳細的詳細， As you heard me say，A lot of my game is in subcommunications， Facial expressions。

 And in this exercise，OK， we're gonna do， Let's do groups of 4 again， We're gonna go 1x1， OK。

 just like switch， And I'm gonna give you a situation， Something to communicate。

 And you're gonna have to communicate that， To the 3 other guys without talking， OK。

 So say right now as an example， I can have you do it， Communicate to the group without talking。

 You went to the grocery store， And they were out of carrots， And you're now upset about that， Go。

 OK， They're out of carrots， You're set， OK， Out of carrots you're upset， OK。

 Now what I like about this exercise， Is it really shows you， Like your range of expressiveness， OK。

 because there are 2， Let's say channels of communication， There's the words。

 And then there's this shit， A lot of my game is focused on this， OK， And you can kind of see。

 Like right now if you all do it， Most of you are probably gonna be， You were OK。

 You were pretty good， You guys were kind of OK， It's like most of you are just like， Cards。

 Instead of being like， Like shit like that， There's a lot more range。

 I want you guys to kind of expand that range， You know what I said just being like， It's like。

 Like that， I want the fucking range， You combine that with the words， Golden， OK。

 So I'm gonna give you some of these situations， And I really want you to go all out， You can't talk。

 But I want range， I want passion， emotion， In that underlying layer of communication， OK。

 So groups of 4， When you do it， You'll express it to the group， You'll do this like 10 seconds。

 Then I'll yell the next situation， And you switch guys， You switch guys every time， OK。

 So first one， You're walking down the street， And an old lady just spat on you， Go， 10 seconds。

 communicate it， OK， Now just pause if you notice， Are you doing this， Instead it's like， Amphi。

 Just like， Like shit like that， It's like come on， Make it fun， Make it expressive。

 Make the guys like sucked into it， Go， OK， try it again， So you're just spat on you， Make it good。

 I love you， OK， Full out like mime shit， Exaggerate it all， OK， Good， Next one， Switch guys。

 You're at the airport， You missed your plane， And you're crying， You're upset。

 You'll never see your girlfriend again， For some reason， OK， Good， Next one， You just realized。

 You lost all your money， Communicate it， All your money gone， Put your body into it more。

 It's like you should be moving like， Fucking crazy， All out， Next one。

 You just add sex to the Jessica Alba， Go， Next one， You're playing a really cool video game， Go。

 And you're really into it， Like full nerd into it， Next one， You're working out。

 You're really into your workout， Go， Like really into it， Like the most intense workout。

 You've done in your life， Next one， You're falling in love， Whatever it is。

 You're falling in love right now， The feelings of love is taken over， All right， Last one。

 You pick it， And you make the other three guys， Find out what the fuck it is， Go。

 And you guys guessed it， The three guys have to fucking guess， What it is， Hey， Good。

 So this one year， I just like bringing attention to that， Okay when I'm talking to girls。

 I'm operating on both。
