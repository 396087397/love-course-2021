# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：1. 克服恐惧：应对错过机会的恐惧3

我也不知道，可是欸，冰淇淋，生成滿些，合遇，和刷會，卸今晚的時候，比中國遊行，對了，是為了自虧是誰，說得被淘汰，淘汰未得，然而無法，事件很由這政策，水烈太厲害了，我是最不守帳，淘汰其我們，當鎖很有實力。

因比較一點，在扶利班同行，也是的時候，而是沒有水路，讓人生世界還有這樣的，另外有這紀佛集給說，有多少 dess Beautie，這個Hunt已經，網絡。

 был最佩服天2的 everybody's life，äg 住早前 costly，唯一差算出那集，還沒開，我跟同中國Kool8員，春晚兩次，派對ukeP， beefy pro，千萬二，叫斯這個從小說。

德國比上，Carl的，我已經過天 啦，我看見大夫和他們一個人，我覺得，那個星期den， anyone in Vegas， immersion are going to。

 that I will accidentally get laid with my exact type of girl， Two of the three nights。

 and most likely the third night， My exact type of girl， I will have sex with。

 and I don't even know who they are。 I've never met these girls before， But I created this pipeline。

 such strong fear of missing out， that these girls who could have gone to the previous events that we did。

 are for sure going to these two events，th these three events but two of them are much more solid。

 and， Its a guaranteed close two of these three nights。

 it's just a matter of how high above my weight， do i want to shoot for。

 do i want to shoot for the hottest or am I okay with getting a guaranteed。

 lay of a girl she's exactly my type， and me she's a 7 instead of the 10。

 there will be about 15 9s or 10s that are my type of these events。

 purely because I've created such a aggressive fear of missing out in their minds。

 will tnitts have willing to all i worry thought of， i think it was even difficult for sometimes c。

 to check free address， in the program， there was a tight connection， and on。

I'll Die Every Day for the next several days， until the next one， having people ask me。

 well when is this next party gonna happen， and meanwhile I've done about 30 minutes of efforts。

 to make this night of their life occur and happen， you can just tell people in your life。

 what type of girl you like， and they'll go off and bring you that type of girl。

 and they'll be happy and feel awesome， for helping you get your dick wet。

 this isn't making any sense at all， because from my place of depression， anxiety。

 and scarcity of rhythm and mentality，我 Didn't think that other guys would want to throw their bones over to me right thing is this。

 There's a lot of power in making such strong， Introductions and creating such a container。

 So the best way that everybody will make this happen is I create this container。

 But I get other people motivated it's called listening motivations when you're listening other people's motivations。

 You get them cut up with your win， It's kind of like the way a college sports team。

 I don't really know about college sports very much but from what I've seen it's the way a college sports team。

已經有了一個很漂亮處，我覺得是這樣，就是譬如在這裡，我被淑音用個了，我 incomplete，經過很多世界經驗，我被視台講過，去往說，人們哈哈，誰說，全都是你們，具體的，捷起來，想像，和回憶，用英語。

教密，我在沒有�에，進我當節目，我會去一個，我去到歐克羅哈馬，BOOMersunner，What is that？，Oh you， is that what it is？。

I'm going to a boomer sooner，I'm doing a boomer sooner pickup thing，It's just a Oh you game。

The thing is I don't give a shit about，The football game，I don't even give a crap about。

What's happening at all within the stadium，I'd pay more to be in the tailgating party section。

 than I would be to actually be in the thing，You have the sports team analogy。

You have all these thousands of students，They don't give a shit about，Basquale。

Don't give a shit about the football， or whatever sport they're doing，But they get so amped up。

 because of the alumni representation，They're so excited to be a part of something。

Well when you can do that in your own social life， where you can get people amped up to be a part of your own social life。

 a part of your own success，That creates a reward for people who are bringing girls into your life。

 and creating massive events for you， without you having to do the events in the first place。

 Does that make sense？，Ok，What I like to do is I like to create specific containers。

 which are events and parties，But again， events and parties， even using those words。

 makes it too strong and too verbose，This Thursday，I made a text yesterday， about a nightclub event。

 in a large city， This coming up this Thursday，You can do social blueprint every city。

 but this one specifically is in Las Vegas，But this event is a。

Surprise birthday party for my best friend，How many years in a row do I need to do a surprise birthday party for eventually。

 He just knows， before eventually， I mean this year is what happened。

 He just started planning his own surprise birthday party， and said can you set it up。

 What about this， A birthday party，Do you mean， I love that I was a birthday party。

 but I can't get 400 girls to come to a surprise birthday party， but I don't tell them。

 Right but the craziest thing is this， Like， The best part is this， He had， ok so my best friend。

 He had 400 girls， waiting to come to this party， I'll grant you about 400 invites。

 We might have 50 Super Hot Girls show up， but we have the trifecta。

 which the cure to an amazing night is the trifecta， meaning three different sources of girls。

 no matter what， So number one we have， these models that are showing up， Number two， we have， our。

 Pageant Girls showing up， which are girls who， because of the FOMO。

 the models and the Pageant Girls， Such fear of missing out。

 of certain events that they couldn't be going to， They're going to show up， Number three。

 because it's a surprise birthday party， All of our friends are going to show up。

 that even don't even care about going to night clubs， because they feel guilty。

 not showing up to it， But check this out， All of those girls were on hold。

 they were on a holding pattern， until I was able to secure the actual venue， and event space。

 that is that area of the night club， but I did what's called value arbitrage。

 Value arbitrage is the easiest way， to create FOMO and fear of missing out。

 if you're not willing to just blow up much cash， If you have a bunch of money。

 and you're willing to blow up a money， on an epic event， more than a barrier。

 and a guy in LA that has a million dollar parties， four times a year。

 and they're some of the sickest parties you ever seen。

 I mean they blow out the play with mansion parties， they're amazing。

 it's a million dollars in one night， I don't have that kind of money， they throw on a party， right？。

 I don't know a lot of people who do， so what do we do？， I create these situations， where I。

 I'm the one who uses value arbitrage， so we have these girls in this holding pattern。

 where my buddy wants to invite all these girls， but we need confirmation， that we can actually have。

 this area of the venue to do our own party yet， otherwise we'd look pretty crazy。

 have these girls just show up to nothing， right？， but。

 I use the fact that we had all of these girls， that want to show up to this event， has leverage。

 in order to， twist the guy's arms， in order to create。

 this actual area of the venue for them to sit at and party yet， well， Gaiei who has access to。

 the projector screen at the nightclub， the music of the nightclub， the lights， the bottles。

 the champagne， all that all the stuff， that makes girls want to have fun。

 the guy who has access to that， he's too busy getting access to that negotiating。

 that kind of access， so he doesn't have the quantity of girls， Gaiei B， he's got。

 over a hundred girls that want to show up to this thing， but he's too busy meeting all these girls。

 to properly set up these kinds of things in place， to set up the， all the， chick crack。

 when you have a lot of girls， you have a lot of chick crack， chick crack is， the sparklers。

 the champagne， the， welcome to the nightclub， whatever their names are as it comes through over the DJ booth。

 the shoutouts on the DJ booth， right the shoutouts the girls like the shoutouts。

 the more shoutouts that the girls can have the more excited they are， right， these events。

 they don't take a lot of effort from you， it's the biggest。

 quell that I have guys send me is oh but I don't have the time。

 no you do these events because you don't have time。

 I don't have time to go off and do a thousand cold approaches per week that， fail， 99。

9% of the time， I do one of these events， and just like I got oh into。

 I'm going to get you guys to pull， fifty percent of the time to a hundred percent of the time。

 literally one out of three one out of you guys all saw the girl that oh， was talking to you right。

 um， for a Wednesday night in that venue I mean， not only is she。

 attractive enough for that situation but how it， yeah I mean， you be like stunning stunning body。

 and the best part is， literally a girl like， within seconds。

 she starts talking about the power of now and， and personal development， to o'n。

 ding ding ding ding， it's not just random hot horse that you're meeting i mean the horse are， great。

 sorry the women are amazing， but it's the fact that these aren't just random girls are girls that you'll。

 actually wants to hang out with， that are being brought to you on a silver platter。

 how many how easy it is for me to get laid on this Thursday again this。

 Thursday that's the one third is less likely， from your success。

 the two thirds of the next day Friday and Saturday。

 yeah on Friday and Saturday I'm going to try to not have at least one， three some each day。

 realistically I'm going to fuck two girls per Friday and per Saturday。

 that I've never had sex with before， and one girl on one of the days I have had sex with before。

 so if you know me at all you know that's pretty funny on one of those days。

 so with this party I'm bringing all these people to this party， with me doing very very little work。

 you take you back to the mean girls example， you call it a thing it's your best friend's surprise birthday party。

 he's inviting the women to his own surprise birthday party。

 but I'm providing the container for him to do it via， value arbitrage。

 value arbitrage is you creating tangible value for yourself。

 out of thin air because you provide value for two separate counterpoints。

 they benefit from it in an exponential way， and then you are able to read the rewards from it。

 meaning any one of you guys can do this type of thing and create a high status。

 lifestyle for yourself， the higher status that you are。

 the more fear missing out you're going to create other people， higher status you are。

 the more stories， they're going to be created other people's minds， take a club like intrigue。

 intrigue has pizza that goes to the club， it's you want to create much more guffin for other people as you can。

 but when you can create someone else's mcguffin， then it gives them an excuse to go out it gives them an excuse to be a part of something。

 once you do that the story's automatically created， for us it's just a。

 another Thursday night it doesn't matter that much。

 but i can when i'm creating this mcguffin i'm creating this mcguffin is a， stick it's a thing。

 that makes it more tangible what actually is， when it's a happening is you have these several hundred girls going to this。

 event， to the girls is the most epic thing ever why because， all of the girls make it that event。

 when they're being invited to this thing again several hundred girls you don't。

 have to know them that well， i know almost none of them。

 but my friend is inviting them to it i'm just providing the container。

 so because i'm being the person who's providing all this container i'm going。

 to arbitrage in all the value， i can sit back barely do any opens at all and girls come up to me and say。

 oh your look i've heard about you， your michael i've heard about you。

 girls that are way more attractive than you could possibly open yourself girls。

 who are so hot they barely even go to nightclubs， they're coming out for this mcguffin for this event。

 and you're the one who organized it， but the organization is i put these two parties together。

 by kept enough separation between them where they still need me。

 and now i'm the one who's the leader of that entire night。

 when you're creating this kind of fear missing out you create this kind of， uh。。。

 epic event situation， the girls will never close you the girls were just wanting out with you you。

 won't have to， do any sort of， fancy pulling or seeding of the clothes。

 they're just so stoked and excited to be a part of， what you're throwing down。

 there's just so excited to be part of this ship that you've built， of fun this ship of positivity。

 that they're not only are they excited to just keep。

 they want to hang out with you not only in the future but it works for that。

 night because they're so excited， to keep it going。

 people are so nervous about losing the status quo。

 they're so nervous about having a really really fun time to be able to， alcohol so people。

 drink and then they try to chase that buzz all night， because as fun as that initial buzz is。

 it's a very short window， that for the rest of the night they're kind of chasing that buzz。

 what is the happening is there， they can't be sober up or。

 sober up and kind of tired or they get way too drunk and sloppy it's very。

 difficult to kind of stay in that， alcohol buzz window。

 same thing is true for fun when you're creating fun for somebody。

 it's very difficult oftentimes for them to maintain their own fun， without it。

 getting like kind of too obnoxious or too， tiresome。

 so you have to do is you create this for someone and once you create this， fun， ship this。

 this this fuck about， is one of our friends likes to call it the fuck about。

 once create this this this fun fuck about， then， once it's over once the time runs out to leave。

 they'll everyone you're going to notice everyone looks to you as what's the。

 next thing to do what's the next step， and that's the crazy thing。

 you don't actually have to live up to the expectations of what you just set， down。

 you create this kind of event you create this value arbitrage effect。

 they're going to look at you as oh what's the next thing that we should be， doing。

 you literally say oh well， well we're all going to the， surprise birthday party after party。

 we're all going to the strip club this is the official last point of this， when you create this。

 this fun fuck about， of enjoyment for them， once it's time to leave they'll just look at you they'll ask you oh so。

 what's the next thing， and you'll just tell them， because you've built up all this credibility of fun of positive emotions。

 rather than you imagine you just called approach one of these girls you go， up to them and。

 you have to dazzle them with your teases your breaks report your keynote and， your， your presence。

 how much energy that takes out of you it's literally almost like your， massage you somebody right。

 you know you've heard of a massage therapist they get carpal tunnel or， they， they actually。

 take on a lot of the toxins of the person that are massaging。

 sounds kind of hokey but i think it's really really true。

 i mean i can imagine being a massage therapist all day long。

 because you literally are like massaging out the pains of the person， it's kind of like verbally。

 gaming somebody without a lot of positive energy who maybe， that person has a lot of energy。

 is your game in such a way where it takes a lot out of you。

 but you're creating this fun vibe you're creating this container this。

 this fun thing you're going to notice that you're going to have 90 to 100% pull， ratio。

 75 50 75% closed ratio， off of the back of these events。

 it doesn't take a lot of opens and a lot of， i even laugh at say it's fucking ridiculous it doesn't take a lot of efforts。

 to fuck girls， 100% of the nights you go out， when you do events like this。

 and i'm going to show you i'm going to put a stopwatch when i add up all， of the。

 things that i did to make this event happen for myself。

 you're going to notice just knowing me just off the back of me， you're going to close girls。

 it's just a slightly less percentage because you're not the owner of the event， but because you're。

 an ancillary an orbiter of me of the event a two degrees of separation。

 depends how much you milk it how gregarious you can be with it， you will also close。

 50% or higher from every single of these events， no game， with shitty game， we're talking 25 to 50%。

 closed ratio of every one of these events， you need gregariousness， that's not game。

 the reason why game isn't that important， once you are able to create this kind of value arbitrage。

 is it's the the gaps are filled in for you， you understand this when you tell a girl about yourself。

 and you give her the highlights you tell a girl about yourself and。

 you're using investment based game or she's， putting participation into the interaction。

 she has a lot of buy-in， in what's happening she has skin in the game。

 right means she's working to get your attention as well， you can say one。

 fifty of the amount of jokes that you want to say。

 when you're talking to girls in order to have sex with them， i'm i'm going to the funny guy too。

 so all the clever jokes and and poignant， lines that i have i can't tell the girls that because too much。

 it's kind of like my buddy is a professional， professional dancer。

 my buddy who is a professional dancer in new york， he can do maximum four moves a night。

 four moves per set per night， before the girls like all day i get it you're。

 one of these dancer guys， you do the game stuff like me i do the game stuff very quickly a girl looks。

 to me she's like oh wait what's happening here are you， are you in a show are you。

 but you're you're too good at this， right you're going to certain point in your game where。

 your game alone girls are going to look at you and they're go。

 well you're you're too good at this or you've done this too many times for。

 anybody have that in your sets of art， yeah it's like you're too smooth for your own good。

 it's like why i stood around purple you want to talk about the sociopath。

 actually i stood around purpose when i'm talking to girls， to build empathy。

 because at a certain point i've set all these lines like what more am i going to。

 at certain point it's just， oh wow is it true is it true they say about girl。

 fuck is it true they say about girls from right if i just go。

 wow is it true they say about girls from texas， it's just too smooth instead of me going。

 oh shit is it true is it true they say about girls from texas。

 does it make sense if you don't stutter it doesn't build an empathy or any。

 comfort in the in the situation， the game is overrated。

 logistics trump's game value arbitrage trump's game， status trump's game。

 some of the stuff is not game some of its logistics， meaning i have。

 i have this these outfits right that i have girls where they come back to my， place。

 it's like rsd lukeware， i just ordered a shit ton more stuff the other day because i really want to。

 i'm going to make all the Brazilian girls wear it， on friday and saturday。

 so when they come back to my place for the party i make them all get naked in， where， uh。。。

 i have this like sexy one piece thing， that has uh。。。 you know luke rogue on it。

 it's pretty funny because the photos will be cool right creates massive， fear missing out， when i。

 said these photos out， crazy guys are like all you know did you know how do you get these girls to。

 wear like shit with your name on it， while it's like ten bucks per hat fifteen bucks per， shirt。

 and when they come over my place i say all right well。

 we're all gonna change now and when they go wait what do you mean i go。

 we're all gonna change now we're gonna wear， we're all gonna wear road clothing loop road。

 got clothing and they go oh okay i guess， or someone go what do you mean i go all right well here it is i want to。

 hand them out， to all of them right， i used to just like costumes jeffy does this in his van is pretty good。

 well i'm making the girls were costumes i took a step further realize。

 what if i just get the girls naked， and then have them put some other clothes on and they can put their clothing。

 to the side， so that's an example of using logistics to fuck these girls that you。

 having to gain them in the last minute， match how much easier does that sex with them。

 when one or more girls are back at your place and you have them wear。

 a shirt or or something that or or panties that say your name on it。

 talk about gregarious and that's crazy， that's just a rule i mean this is a。

 so no panties on or this is a， only road clothing zone。

 meaning no you know my last name right plus on the on the booty shorts whatever。

 and then they go if there's any resistance all your creepy what do you mean i。

 don't want to do that i'm not gonna get naked here whoa whoa shut your， whore mouth。

 what did you say i said i'm a hold on i'm a godfiring man。

 you're gonna change in there i don't want to see you naked i don't want to。

 go to hell i'm not gonna like， let my eyes burn， i don't want to see you change this is just the rules of my domain。

 you go in there you change you come back out， and you better not fucking crack that door because i don't want to see anything i。

 don't need to see， makes sense the point is not to be this pervy guys trying to escalate。

 the point is you want them once they've changed clothing one time。

 into something that has your name on it how easy you think it is to fucking， close them。

 super super easy by being the value arbitrage your。

 you have way more success he knows this because he's a better connector。

 even than i am you have way more success that's pulled from you connecting。

 people together way more stories are created， than you actually being the guy who's putting the grunt work of each individual。

 thing， like do i'm this guy who's like the most out of shape i've been in my whole life。

 this year all net profit some of the worst income in my entire life。

 because i'm building my business right the separate business so， my net profit is super low my。

 health in general is low because i'm working seven days a week。

 which working seven days a week meaning i'm traveling。

 one to two days a week and working five days you know。

 i'm traveling to one of these a week and working between five and seven days a week， in loud venues。

 i'm not exactly like living up to my own personal potential because i'm。

 rebuilding somethings right and and try to help as many guys as possible and。

 kind of rebuild my my programs right， so i think i understand is i'm a pretty relatable get to do the kind of。

 thing that i'm doing as well meaning i'm not throwing the million dollar， party， but i'm。

 consistently being begged， to go to the million dollar party， that's about as good， right。

 i'm not inviting four hundred girls because i don't have the time to meet four， hundred girls。

 i don't have that kind of time， i don't have the time to meet twenty girls a week right now i right now i。

 barely have the time to meet five girls a week i'd write。

 right now i want to meet three girls a week fuck two of the three， and that's like oh my god fuck。

 i'm like pulling an all nighter that night， and even now i'm like。

 i barely have the time because i'd rather get you guys late。

 i'd rather you know duplicate what i'm doing for you guys， so understand。

 you like instantly number one is it's like what his problem was right so like， what problem was。

 he uh。。。 last week， he was like all right well that's fine for you but how do i do this for me。

 no realizing no right now you guys can have the same success that i'm having。

 you can go after your nine and ten right now you can create the kind of， experiences in your life。

 now you don't need to wait until you know this person or that person， we start with the type of uh。。

。 and i built it up， i built it up by just having， a bunch of people in one area at a club at a bar。

 like a bar of a club， and， people i just hand me their business cards because they saw that。

 i was i kind of was corralling the group that i was just kind of was running。

 the group a little bit， what is running the group me i had my backup against the bar and i。

 said some stuff， not even that great of game right any one of you guys can do that。

 you do that with a， positive vibe you get with enough volume you get with enough crazy shit。

 kind of happening in that area， you cause a scene。

 then what's going to happen is people are going to just randomly come give。

 their business cards to you that are hosts promoters bar managers， uh。。。 one of the best uh。。。

 bars in new york city， the owner came up to me and uh。。。

 this girl i was with at the time and he said， you know what hey you guys are kind of people i want my venue。

 and it's not super creepy like some weird sex club thing。

 back then i i looked like i how i look at my facebook photos i looked。

 pretty good so i thought it was uh。。。 some creepy thing he was doing。

 it's like this little round man， and i'm like it was just very very creepy how he handed his card off and i go。

 okay that's kind of cool thanks he goes no really， you guys got to come to my my bar。

 turns out it's like the most popular like p。o。a bar all of new york city。

 he just literally saw that we were jumping up and down when that uh。。。， just in timbre lake and um。。

。 jazzy song came on， was that what was that just really congezzy was it， isn't talking about。

 and you guys get get on the music， anyway that song came on me and me and her at four a。m。

 in new and i went out， in york， every sunday this song just goes crazy and they。

 confetti everywhere and it's four o'clock is the time they can keep party。

 there but you can't walk in the nightclub anymore。

 so it's like a the nightclub hits reset and so new party， so for like five thirty。

 every was crazy because no one else can walk in， so that the doors lock but everyone goes nuts。

 so we just go crazy looks at us like oh my god you guys are got you guys are。

 the group that i want my venue in my club， we're like all right cool thanks we start talking just a little bit right。

 well he's then the key to everything we go into his place he's like has。

 gives us a security guard just for the rest of the night。

 he gives us this whole comp area that we don't even end up sitting at we're。

 just kind of going through because his venue is like three or four floors。

 we're going through it understand that was off one night any one of you guys。

 can do exactly i did i jumped up and down when it just in timbre lake song came on。

 got into doing that intense it wasn't anything that you guys have to work up。

 to do right when you guys are vision board and you're exact type of girl。

 well the cool guys you want your life for the type of events that you want to do。

 there's three different type of vision boards realize you can achieve it this。

 weekend you don't have to wait months so nothing is too。

 more too advanced for you you follow the type of event that i'm doing this。

 Thursday i met a guy who i can throw a birthday party for。

 who's got a couple hundred girls that he knows he's going to invite them to。

 some party i happen to another guy i don't know anybody who works at this。

 nightclub i probably couldn't even get into this nightclub because i've。

 been there in over a year it's at tau i don't even know how to get into it i。

 could make some text and kind of like you know bluff my way in but i couldn't。

 just walk up and walk in the club i have no social proof that this venue。

 yet they're going to give us you heard them at the end two tables unlimited。

 bottles okay and i don't know anybody who's there。

 if i can do it why can't you guys do it i don't know anybody who works there。

 you'll never see it happening for yourself until it happens for yourself。

 belief faith that's a very weird thing right， you don't need to believe that it's going to happen you just have to do the。

 steps and put those things in place and then watch the results happen and。

 then you'll have the belief because i'm amp you up but here's the thing i'm。

 i go to get my teeth done i'm making it so people laugh and have so much fun。

 when they're getting their teeth done that the dentist literally i've never。

 ever seen him before he literally gives me the wholesale cost for whatever。

 veneers or procedures that i'm trying to do off of never knowing him。

 off of the first time he looks at me like a marketing asset。

 he makes jokes like he should hire me to just sit in the dental lobby。

 and just do that all day long i'm literally i'm literally selling dental。

 packages and services that i don't even know about in the dental office i mean。

 as a joke kind of but also for real i mean just because i'm trying to。

 pass the time in such a fun obnoxious way， in order to enforce myself to always be on always be there。

 you understand， if i if you can have fun at the dental office you can have fun at the chipotle。

 if you can have fun at the chipotle then you're going to be able to have fun。

 and have high energy in the nightclub and i'm always on with other people even。

 if i'm depressed or in bad state i'm not ever trying to create my own state。

 i'm trying to boost everyone's state around me， i'm trying to force state transference from other people to me。

 not meet other people the point is this like you could get so much more out of。

 this than girls or than anything you could possibly imagine you don't have。

 to wait you can do it right now。
