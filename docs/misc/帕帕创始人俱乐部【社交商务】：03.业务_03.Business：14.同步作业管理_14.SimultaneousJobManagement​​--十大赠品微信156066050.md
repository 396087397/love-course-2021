 and that's because， a liberal art education， which is like that multi-job skills。

 where you may not become a geologist， you may not become a rocket scientist or a chemist。

 you might even become an economist or a businessman， but by having the knowledge of having studied。

 you know chemistry， biology， business， economics， geology， all that stuff。

 you relate to people in a so much more interesting way。

 and you'll be surprised when the knowledge that you've learned。

 from these various things may help you in conversation。

 may help you in making a decision about life， or about business or your careers。

 in your life you usually have career path changes， RSD for example。

 even though it's one long-term career， it's a career path that is jumped around。

 with these people from one end of D to the next， you know we weren't always called real social dynamics。

 you know we start off as being called， a world command or something else and it's。

 well in all the same people， me， Tyler and a bunch of other people， at the same time。

 our way we run the company has been different， the structures has been different。

 what we teach has expanded， the same thing happens in your career。

 you might be like an engineer and you go to another path。

 but working all these different jobs has been something that has really inspired me。

 but you got to plan your time very carefully if you're going to do this。

 because if you don't you're going to end up losing everything， I personally am used to doing that。

 because I've always personally have to， overbook my time， I've been doing my life like an airline。

 where I overbook a number of seats on a plane very often， I used to overbook。

 going out socially and inviting， hang out with like six girls and。

 doing that possibly a lot at the same time， or I invite like five guys all hang out at the same time。

 if multiple people said yes then I guess I would be hanging out with multiple people。

 or I would just， change plans with one or the other， because you never know。

 who is going to be able to say yes and who's going to flake， that's why airlines do it because。

 statistically speaking a certain number of people will flake。

 especially as your development soul circle and it's not like， a large。

 meaningful deep relationship with these people that you're trying to network with。

 and the same thing goes， with jobs and business skill sets。

 sometimes if you're first starting your career especially。

 you're not like that established businessman， you're kind of。

 dipping your feet in the water and trying to figure out what you like and what you don't like。

 and the skills you take from one job will be very interchangeable skills。

 you can use in almost any other job， even if it's going to completely different industry you know surprise yourself。

 there's a prize yourself how different， an industry can be where you still take your skillsets in the business world。

 and apply it to that particular business， but being top of your business and don't， overstretch。

 know your boundaries， know what you can and cannot do。

 on the other hand you can't know what your boundaries are unless you really， test the limits。

 of your time and what you can， cannot do， and that's a stressful process。

 so you have to go through that process of overbooking if you really want to know。

 what that process is you can take the conservative route and not do that。

 but for those of you who want to take the risk of simultaneously job。

 job management you know that you're going to be crossing that point。

 you can be crossing that line where you have to take those risks。
