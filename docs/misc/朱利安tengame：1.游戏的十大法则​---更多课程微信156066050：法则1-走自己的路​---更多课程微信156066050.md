# 朱利安ten game：1.游戏的十大法则​---更多课程微信156066050：法则 1- 走自己的路​---更多课程微信156066050

 Guys just get stifled by so much theory， they get stifled when they go out， they get stifled。

 they analyze all the little details， even showing some infield footage。

 there's like some segments where say， I might be standing up and the girl sitting down。

 and they're like wait a minute， shouldn't you be sitting down。

 or shouldn't you be facing her this way， what about these little details here。

 and in reality a lot of that shit just doesn't matter， if you can actually get out of your own way。

 focus on what I call the macro concepts， not the micro concepts。

 they'll just take care of all the details， because what happens is we kind of went backwards。

 we're back in the day， this happened with routines， guys we get stifled with routines。

 and it would kill the soul of pickup， it would kill the humanity let's just say。

 but what happens now， you get stifled by all these concepts， you'll see guys are out。

 like oh am I in state？， oh am I vibration energy？， should like that？， it stifles you。

 am I standing the exact right way？， is my hand like should right exact position？。

 a lot of that shit just doesn't matter， so for me these 10 laws。

 and you can call them whatever you want to call them， really sum up everything that I do in game。

 from a basic level to even the most advanced shit， so we're going to kind of structure this way。

 and break these down， I wrote them down here， and we'll start with the first one。

 getting out of your own way， who here believes that， the way you learn game is you go out。

 you get a lot of reference experiences， and you build this， or perfect this attractive personality。

 or use your hand， that's how you get good at game， wrong， wrong， okay。

 you already have that right now， this is not something like game。

 it's not something that you build up to， okay it's something that you already have。

 there's just shit that's blocking it from coming out， you all have scenarios in your life right now。

 it could be not necessarily with women， but it could be with like close friends， family。

 maybe a girl you don't find attractive， you have that fun outgoing attractive personality。

 when you talk to a girl who's a two， do you run out of things to say。

 so you already know how to keep talking and talking。

 what happens is now you're placed in front of the 10， and you fucking freeze。

 so it's not like okay let's build up， to learn how to keep talking and talking。

 it's how to unleash that shit that you have， when you talk to the two。

 how to unleash that personality， you have when you talk to your close friends。

 and if you're scared to do it to your close friends， I was joke you know most guys do。

 and they play video games， if you ever listen in on like one of those like online games。

 you'll see like little shy kids， like the nerdiest people in the world。

 if you see them out in the real world， nerdy shy probably walking around like this。

 they put on that headphone alone in their house， they fucking chat， they have that personality。

 they have a sense of humor， they're probably like the loudest。

 mouth motherfuckers on the fucking game， so how can they bring that out in the real world， okay。

 getting out of your own way is probably 80% of game， it's huge okay， like that first law for me。

 it's pretty much the， I'd say yeah 80% the shit I focus on when I'm out。

 you get out of your own way， the girls will fucking love you。

 and then it's just like a few little tweaks here and there。

 and then maybe some logistics and you pull it， that's it， okay。

 so what are some of the things that may get in your own way。

 what are some of the things you may think， will block you when you're out， what does it say。

 that's not what's blocking you， it's like well what's blocking you from knowing what to say。

 self trust， but what's blocking you from trusting yourself， okay， you could say entitlement。

 I want more like these， the blockage， entitlement could be one， what else。

 what's the thing on having fun， there's this， in the willing need for approval， need for approval。

 big one， yep， you have an agenda， attach to an outcome， yeah。

 feeling what you have is not good enough for building it， yeah entitlement， internal fears。

 internal fears， yep， that you now， get in the results， sometimes yes。

 some more attached the approval， like the key here is always be consistent， I'm never inconsistent。

 being modest， like I never have a bad night out， I sort of got it。

 I cannot remember the last bad night out I've had， I don't always pull obviously。

 I still get rejected， but I never have a bad night out， I'm never out of state， ever， why is that。

 okay， what do I keep with the reasons， the reason， the same creepy things and uncalibrated things。

 yep that's not one of the blockages， you can lock the， mm-hmm， let me take some things personal。

 yeah， yeah， do you think this is a personal， not being grounded， like your own shit。

 but why are you not grounded， that's the key， it's crazy， what is the key， self-doubt。

 so entitlement self-doubt， you're being like always waiting for the right moment， good。

 ready for the right moment， not being present， uh-huh， self-doubt， self-what， self-prire， yep， ego。

 rejection， fear of rejection， nervousness， nervousness， I'm going to go up there and build， yep。

 oh yeah， big one， look at the last one here， kind of protecting your image。

 that you might have already passed up， that you built up， huge， that's big， okay。

 so we're going to go through these here， let's kind of build on， limiting beliefs。

 we'll start with those， okay， so， I want you to kind of be aware， you know。

 you probably hear looks and money， do they matter， yes or no， no， you all say no。

 and you want to say yes？， yes， you don't say no， no， they don't， but， like， at all。

 they don't matter at all， my favorite come back by the way for people are like， they do matter。

 I'd be really happy if they did matter， because I'd be making way more money off you guys。

 swear to god， if looks， for example， mattered， I would have the fat guy product。

 the skinny guy product，， the fat guy hot seat， the skinny guy hot seat，， the old guy hot seat。

 the young guy hot seat，， you know， the ugly guy hot seat， the good looking guy hot seat，。

 the rich guy hot seat， the poor guy hot seat，， it'd be fucking amazing， I swear to god。

 if that all mattered，， oh my god， like business would skyrocket， but sadly， it doesn't matter， okay。

 at all， how you feel about it matters， but those factors do not matter， okay。

 I've picked up girls off celebs， I picked up girls off rich guys off poor guys， I was skinny。

 I was fat， I was stressed like shit， I was， you know， well dressed， it doesn't matter。

 it doesn't matter， it was poor， I wasn't poor， I was good reputation， worst reputation in the world。

 it doesn't matter， at all， it does not matter， but I want to bring your attention to kind of。

 just make you aware of your true beliefs， okay， and this is really step one。

 to getting out of your own way， it's being real with yourself。

 and being honest with yourself and not just regurgitating bullshit。

 so let's just say right now we take one of those scary scenarios， okay。

 you go out to a club tonight and let's just say， you manage to get into the most exclusive club ever。

 you're dressed like this， right now you're transported in that club， in that club。

 who's a model or celebrity in actress， or someone you just find really attractive， or anyone？。

 January Jones， Bang， you go out tonight， January Jones is there。

 dressed the hottest you've ever seen her， she's naked， she's saying they're naked。

 she's at the most VIP table in the club， surrounded by the coolest。

 most high-value people in the world， all the celebrities are there， she's next to Leo， Johnny Depp。

 everyone， male models， rich guys， she's next to me， you know。

 there's like massive security bodyguards all around， everyone's there just for her， lights on her。

 everyone on the dance floor is looking， oh my god， January Jones， there's like， again。

 ropes upon ropes， of bodyguards， you're here like that。

 and your buddy next to you turns to you and it's like open， who here would freeze a little bit。

 raise your hand， a lot， okay， you'd be like oh my god， now there's something blocking you there。

 okay what we did is really created that scenario， where you know， somewhere to you going up to a 10。

 it's like something's gonna block that attractive personality。

 that you can maybe bring out in a more chill environment。

 now to kind of be aware of say what limiting beliefs you kind of buy into， corny scenario。

 I'll just say some genie fucking appeared in front of you， you're there in the club。

 January Jones there， she fucking genie appears， he's like hey man， what's your name？， Hector。

 I can give you whatever you want right now， I can't give you beliefs though。

 but what can I give you for you to feel 100% confident rocking up to January Jones， Bode S4。

 no one will ever know， and think about this， fucking genie， whatever you want。

 who here would ask for looks， raise your hand， look differently， really？， I would， bullshit。

 all of you mother fuckers would ask to look differently。

 deep down inside of a fucking genie showed up， anything you want， are you kidding me？。

 you would ask to look differently， give me fucking and shave big time。

 like I would ask for fuck so many things differently， you wouldn't， you'd rock up like that。

 you know， I would be against my， I would ask for the interest of I said that， you know。

 I wanted to send you for who I am， so yeah， well then why are you freezing？， I got to see that。

 and that starts with being honest with yourself， 99% or like literally all of you guys are bullshitting yourself。

 if you're not saying you'd ask to look differently， 99。9% of you are bullshitting yourself。

 if you're saying you're not going to ask for maybe 10 models rolling up with you。

 you would feel a little bit more at ease， maybe some more money， maybe a cooler lifestyle。

 maybe access to cooler shit， I would ask for money， money， who you're asking for money？。

 what about status？， what about being famous？， maybe she heard of you before and she's intimidated。

 anyone？， self confidence， can't give you beliefs， okay， give you beliefs。

 what can you give you to make you feel self confidence？， flawless game， rappers is great。

 rappers are like you're talking to your close friends， so they're like your qualifiers， Lincoln。

 what do you think else？， one， yeah， they're going， that starts with being honest though。

 until you can accept those beliefs you actually hang on to， where you feel like you're not enough。

 hangs out with celebs like that，Good luck winning that game there， do that for you。

 but there's also a lot of pressure， for the fact that you understand that you don't need to win that game either。

 okay， the best way to snap out of it， and we'll keep dissecting this。

 I'm just kind of laying down the groundwork， is to zone in on the one thing you can offer。

 that no one else can top you at， and what is that， the one thing you can offer。

 the no one else in the world can beat you at， your own uniqueness， it's actually true。

 it's your own uniqueness， that's it， that's the only thing of value。

 you can offer the no one else can top you at， and that's what's going to draw her in。

 it sounds super cheesy， but that's how you win the game， and there's a lot of pressure in the game。

 that's what the real thing is， that's the only thing you can offer the no one else can top you at。

那部電話聽得到，而間諒已被大 feelings，他一大把心力，溫然他們使得，似乎 Steven，台國大，有幾個歌，解不能夠就件事，第138 part，第30首，排隊，對，排隊，準備，好，我，j，讓我。

Kevin有一個，個人有開玩家的，連我ught，變成了我知道， economically he is not like a super cool dude。

 he heard modeling career could definitely go up by being with him， get you choose the dirty 2120秋古兀。

 broke his f** political state， because my experience stuffed Panda segregation， his horoscope， he Ī。

horc breaking thgs，OK， and we'll talk about this so you can harness it as well， OK。

 but some things to keep in mind。， Now， that's just the limiting beliefs， OK？

 The other one is what we talked about before，， obsessing over the details， OK？

 And if there's one thing you need， like， right this down，， it's the soul primes above all else。

 the soul primes above all else。， That's what really matters in the game， OK？ What's the soul？

 That could be your own uniqueness。， That's it。 That's what primes above technique， above content。

 above theory，， above guidelines， above rules。 The girl would be a lot more attracted to you if you broke the rules a bit。

 and made it more human than if you were perfect。 That's what she's looking for。。

 The guy who tries to be perfect， who tries to follow every little step， every rule of the game，。

 he's boring。 There is no soul， there is no uniqueness， there's nothing attractive about it。。

 Just kind of counterintuitive because you find out about game， you want to follow the rules。。

 I'm saying break the rules， OK？ And I'm not saying necessarily proactively break them，。

 instead focus on the big concepts and then forget about all the little details。， OK。

 this is what will stifle you when you open。 Someone said waiting for the perfect opportunity。。

 Who said that？ Who's that？ Is it you？ Yeah， that's the little details， OK？。

 And understand too that no girl has ever judged you because of the little details。。

 She's always looking at the macro at the bigger picture。 The same with your opener。。

 You guys want to open smoothly。 You want everything to be perfect。。

 There's a stereotype of guys who want the game to be beautiful。 The game should be beautiful。。

 That's what a pick up should be。 As soon as it's a little messy。

 as soon as it dies down a little bit，， I'm out， it's fucked。 Wrong。 OK。

 there are going to be times where it's messy。， Extremely messy， there are going to be ups and downs。

 Times where the girl is attracted， she's really into it。， Time should get a little fucking bored。

 Time where she withdraws her I。O。I's。， Let's just say。 And most guys just bounce out。 It's like。

 that little moment was fucked up。， Oh， I ran out of things to say for a second。 Oh。

 her friends came in and I look stupid for a second。 It's over。， My opener was shit。 It's over。 No。

 OK， no girl has ever fucked someone because of his opener。。

 No girl has ever not fucked someone because of his opener。。

 No girl has ever fucked someone because he looked cool when her friends came in。。

 And no girl has ever not fucked someone because he didn't look cool for a little second when her friends came in。

， She's not looking at all the little details。 She's like， overall， is this guy the shit？ Yes or no？。

 It'll never happen。 You're in bed with a girl。 She's like， you're awesome。 Except for your opener。

 it's over。， Ever。 No girl is going to be you。 No， what？ I really like you。

 but the only reason I'm fucking you is because of that opener。， Ever。

 Those little details don't matter。 Let go of them and bring some humanity to your interactions。， OK。

 get out of your own way。 Yes。， Yeah， but sometimes like the little details like later on in the interaction can fuck it up for you。

， Not for me。 Why？ Because I bring so much humanity， so much soul。 She loves me。， Yeah。。

 But the girl still wants to be seduced， right？ She wants to be a cool guy。。

 She wants to meet the cook。 Yeah， but if you show the you for on shoulder like this girl。

 but this girl。 Why would you do that？， No， just， just him。 I don't have that thing just。， Yeah。

 don't chat。 There's also， we'll talk about it with number six， think win-win and play it。

 It's still smart。， Like it's like， oh， it's all about the soul。 Let me whip my dick out。。

 You said the details didn't matter， but if I whip my dick out， you still have to use your brain。。

 But trust me， details don't matter。 I go up to girl。 I can break the rules。

 I can go up a shit body language。， That's another little detail。 But what about the body language？

 Doesn't matter。 I can go up like this。 The girl will fucking love me。， She'll love me。 OK。

 like literally I can go like， hey。 How's it going？， She'll be like， ah， he's cool。 I can lean in。

 Hey， how's it going？ I can literally do anything。 I could do like， hey。， She'll love me。

 Literally I could be like this talking to a girl like so。 Where are you from？， Yeah。

 And she'll be like， what's wrong with your leg？ Nothing。， So， just that。 I could say like this。

 the girl will love me。 I'm breaking every single rule when it comes to body language。。

 She'll still love me。 Those little details do not matter at all。， And notice。

 you're still listening。 It's like， what is this？ You're like， OK， let's keep it going。

 It doesn't matter。， OK， the little details don't matter。 The opener doesn't matter。

 You can stumble into it doesn't matter。 The same way that the fucking seminar here。。

 I could rock up here and fumble for the first five minutes of me talking。 There is no flow。

 It's like， so， hello， everyone。， Does it matter？ No。 Big picture， humanity。

 let go of trying to be perfect， let go of having that smooth interaction where everything goes to plan。

， You are going to fuck it up。 Be OK with fucking it up。 OK。

 and trust that she's looking at the bigger picture。 And trust， the one matters is that soul。

 that humanity， that flow， not you being perfect。， She doesn't fuck you because you're following every little detail and you did your pick up right。

 She's fucking you because you're a cool guy who offers real value and we'll talk about this。， OK。

 who offers that uniqueness， who offers that soul？ Yes。， Things are going wrong。

 And what point do you just leave the sense you did？， We'll get to it。 We just started。 OK。

 but keep that in mind。 OK， and don't beat yourself up because that's a big reason guys beat themselves up too。

， You break the fucking rules。 You're like stupid。 What do you just do now？

 You're killing the soul because now you feel like shit。。

 How do you want to make that an awesome experience for the girl if you're not having an awesome experience？

， So key。 OK， and those are really the interactions that stand out。

 And I can't help but also link this to public speaking。 You know， there's。。

 When I first started speaking in front of audiences， there was。 I wanted everything to be perfect。

 So I actually structured out this like years ago， like when I opened for Tyler and the free tours。。

 Anyone ever see me back then or no？ You guys in？ OK， yeah。

 It wasn't even actually before you guys like way， way back。， Like yeah。

 that was when I was wearing those little cumstain shirts and shit。 And I remember one was in LA。

 So I rolled up in LA and I was like， OK， this is my first time speaking。， So he's like。

 just prepare 10 minutes。 Whatever you want to talk about。 Go up on stage。 You'll rock it。

 So I said now it's freaking out。 Like， oh， shit。 OK， how am I going to， you know， real everyone in？

 How can I？， How am I going to make sure they like me？ My content is going to be on point。

 So I actually sat down the day before and I was like writing down in detail。， It was about pulling。

 So I'm like， right now I'm going to talk about this。 Then I'll link it to this concept。

 Then I'll talk about this。 Then I'll say this little joke and I'll do this。 And I'll do this。

 I'll real him in。， Rock up on stage。 First of all， I'm shoved in my head。

 He also shoves me in my head on purpose。 It's a little extra challenge。 He's like， listen to Julian。

 Everything he says is gold。 He's been preparing this for a long time。， I hope you're ready。

 And I'm like， oh， my God。 It's going to be the best 10 minute segment you will ever hear in your life。

 Go rock it。 And I'm like， hello， everyone。 And I started off and it starts off like， OK。

 there's not that much solar passions， kind of like mechanically going through it。。

 And then I realize I miss a point。 It's a minor detail。 It doesn't really matter。

 The content's still really good。 But in the back of my mind， what happens？ It's all fucked。。

 Fuck this。 I don't even want to be here anymore。 I missed that one point。 The videos。

 fuck the seminars， fuck this whole thing， fuck。， I still have to talk。

 I'm still there in other fucking 10， 20 minutes。 It was actually 30s。 I go up for 30 psych。

 So I'm like， still there for 20。 But I just hated every second of it。 I still did well。

 The content was still there。 But the entire time in the vibe， the smile was a little fake。

 The fun was a little fake because I'm like， I fucking missed that point。， And then from there。

 what did I do？ I gave myself some general topics to touch on。

 I didn't go too much into detail because that fucks up my seminars。， So if I go do a free tour。

 I'm like， oh， I may touch on this， this， this。 Let's see how it goes。

 Let's go with the flow and value that humanity that soul above all else versus making it all perfect。

， Talking about every little detail of it。 That kills it。 That doesn't make for a fun seminar。

 And that kills the value you get out of it too because there's no flow。 It's not fun for you。

 Why would you listen？ Why would you take it all in？， So same with game。

 Don't try to make it all perfect。 Have some general ideas where you're going to take it。

 And we'll go over this here。 But then be okay。 Make a little mistake。 Be okay。， You fumble。 Be okay。

 The girl comes in。 You're like， oh， do say something stupid。 Be okay。

 You forget to do something like shit。 I forgot to ask that。 It's okay。

 Keep it going and enjoy it all and realize that's also it makes a human。， Okay。

 That's what makes it you。 So that's a big one。 The other one。

 someone touched on this is fear of rejection。 And this is big。 Or addiction to people's approval。

 That's stifles you big time。， Okay。 So a few things to understand here。 First of all。

 realize that if you're going out， your harness in that uniqueness， you're putting it out there。

 Is it for everyone？ No。 At all。， Okay。 No matter who you are。

 if you're authentically expressing yourself， some girls are just not in a one any of it。

 And that is normal。 That is natural。， Be okay with that。 And be okay with rejection。

 Rejection is not good。 It's not bad。 It's natural。 You should be getting rejected。

 I still get rejected every single time I go out。， Am I doing anything wrong？ No。

 It's normal to be rejected。 Okay。 If you meet someone new， there's some people you like。

 some people you don't like。 Maybe I work。 Some people you just connect with fast。

 Some people you don't。 Even in this room here， if you guys all talk to each other，。

 there's some guys who are going to like more than others。

 Did the others you don't like so much do anything wrong， not necessarily。 You just don't connect。

 That's natural。， Okay。 They didn't do anything wrong。 You didn't do anything wrong。

 You're just not meant to connect。 That's the way things are。 The same with girls。

 No matter what you do， they're not going to like you。 And no matter what some girls do。

 you're not going to like them。， Now that's tough to kind of believe if you're new because you're like。

 no， any girls is like， good looking。 I like her。 No。 A lot of those girls you won't。， Okay。

 For example， my humor is pretty out there。 That's congruent to me。 If I go up to a girl。

 some are going to love it。 Some are not。 Half the world isn't。 Okay。

 They're not going to fucking like it。 And that's fine。， Okay。

 The only way to get everyone to like you is to keep changing who you are。

 like being a social chameleon and try to manipulate their reactions。， But by doing that， you also。

 this is like the ultimate people， please are by the way。

 You compromise who you are and you compromise the uniqueness and you compromise yourself worth。。

 And would you really want to be with that person there？

 Like let's say you go up to a girl and let's have a girl。。

 I say my joke that's a little out there and she's like， it's offended。 It's like， okay。

 I better tone it down big time and never bring out my sense of humor to get her。， I could do that。

 I feel like shit the entire time。 And let's say I did get her and like we started dating。

 It would be hell。， Because you would always be hiding that part of who you are。

 You'd be walking on eggshells all the time。 You'd always be aware of， oh am I am I am I okay。

 Am I giving off the right impression？ It'd be like hell。， You'd be paranoid。 It would be hell。

 Now fun enough， this is most guys relationships do。

 There with a girl and they're just paranoid every second of the day of breaking that impression or that image they're trying to maintain。

， Why not learn to harness who you are？ Where you find those girls who like you。

 It's cheesy as it sounds just for who you are。 Where you don't have to worry about all that。。

 That's the ideal。 That's when you're in your power， when you're out。

 That's when you're power in a fucking relationship。 It shouldn't be like your sanctuary。

 When I'm out and I'm gaming， I'm not worried about the impression。。

 I am worried about relatability to an extent and we will talk about this。

 But not to the extent where I'm compromising who I am and what's congruent and authentic to me。。

 Okay， and we'll get to this。 But understand rejections normal。

 You should be getting rejected and get out of that people pleasing paradigm where you try to make every girl like you。

， That's most guys goals。 They go out。 They don't even want to succeed。

 Their vision or version of success is not even getting a girl。 It's just not getting rejected。。

 You can kind of test yourself on this。 You probably have an awesome night。

 You don't get any numbers。 You don't get laid。 But let's just say every girl just really liked you and laughed at you and you just looked really cool。

， That would be most guys version of success。 You could go home。 Nothing happened。 But you're like。

 yeah， it looked really cool。 Fuelling your ego。 Let's just say。， And for that。

 it's like really sit down at home and be like， okay， what do you want out of this？

 Do you want to be the ultimate people， please？， Or do you want to start getting along with a lot of cool girls who you just enjoy and just have a blast expressing who you are and not holding back。

 not manipulating？， You could go other people， please， or out。

 But then don't be surprised if your nights are stressful and it feels like hell。

 And it's not as fun。， Okay。 Building on that too。 Understand the rejection。 A lot of the time。

 There's nothing really to do with you。， Okay。 There are many other factors that come into play。

 Maybe you open a girl and she's just having the worst night of her life。

 Maybe she found out her grandmother passed away a second before you opened。， Guess what？

 You're going to get rejected。 She's just not there yet。 Okay。 Maybe she's just having a bad night。

 Maybe she wants a night where she doesn't really socialize。 She just out for a drink。。

 You guys might have had that too。 You just go out one night and you're like， you know what？

 I just want to talk to me right now。 I just want to take a chill。

 Maybe you're catching up with an old friend。 No， I'm good。。

 I think to do necessarily with the person talking to you， just where you're at。

 That'll happen to girls。， This also happened to girls throughout the nights where during different parts of the night。

 they'll be open to different things。， Okay。 And this is big。

 You probably heard me talk about this in Pimp。 I talk about the tempo of the night。

 We're usually in the first part of the night and we'll get to this too。。

 The girl's goal isn't to just leave and fuck someone。 It's just too early。

 She wants that as a climax of this emotional buildup that's a night out。， And number two。

 she doesn't want to spend the next four hours talking to one dude。

 That's on her goal when she goes out to a bar or a club。。

 So because of that in that first part of the night。

 even if your game is 10 out of 10 and you're on point， you're authentic。

 you bring in the fucking like uniqueness， the soul， your interactions probably in the last five， 10。

 15 minutes， maybe 20 max。， It's going to die down。， You probably noticed this。

 Sometimes you're just really on point。 The girl loves you。 And after 10 minutes。

 you just starts dying down。 And you're like， what the fuck？， I didn't do anything wrong。 No。

 you didn't。 It's supposed to die down。 It's not time yet。

 That's when you get a number in day two for later that night。， But it's tough for us to accept this。

 Like， fuck a guy rejected。 Got to amp up my game with our realizing， no， it's just not time yet。。

 Everything's rejection in that first part of the night。 No matter how good you do。

 you're not going to fuck that girl and she's not going to spend the entire night talking to you。。

 Okay。 Yeah， we beat ourselves up。， Another one of this fear of rejection is we don't realize that it's gradual。

 We tend to think that if we talk to a girl， she'll love us or she'll absolutely hate us。。

 And we better not say the wrong thing or she'll switch immediately to just absolutely hating us。 No。

 Usually it just kind of dies down as I mentioned。， Okay。

 unless you do something extremely uncalibrated， you're good。 Okay。

 there's nothing to be that scared of。 And something to just also think about too， you know。

 in your home is， why do you care so much？， Why are you so attached to someone's approval？

 Why do you need the girl or believe you need the girl to feel complete？。

 What's so bad if you don't get the girl？， I think it's like totally awesome or something you say or something totally fucked。

 But that fatalistic thing， that can help me thought that it happens in other areas of life too。

 I think in the gym， if I don't get completely perfect workout， I'm not going to go to the gym。。

 If you're not there now and have out， you have 45 minutes to fuck it。

 Like I'm not even going at all。 But if you went 40 minutes。

 it couldn't be like way better than just fucking it。， So key。 Yeah， dude。

 And that's also keeps you motivated。 Like this whole getting out of your own way。

 And we'll get to this where it's like your night should be like so much fun and shit。。

 It's like if you're not able to go out and have like a blast。

 If you're like so caught up in the rules and you take it so seriously， you're not going to survive。。

 You're going to give up。 You know， and some of you may have experienced this like I'm currently getting back in shape right now。

， And I can guarantee if I didn't enjoy getting back in shape， if I didn't enjoy going to the gym。

 I'd have willpower at first and I could fucking do it to an extent。。

 But I'd give up at some point you will fucking give up。 And I'm sure you all have。

 I have in the past two。 It's like I'm going to like。， Oh， the gym。

 I hate the gym and I'm fucking going to like barrel through barrel through。

 And I just absolutely hate it the entire time。， Guess what？

 You try to make that part of your life like， you know， four times if not more a week。

 You're talking to survive。 Your willpower will be depleted very fast。 Same with game。。

 You're going out。 Oh， I got to hate so fucking tough。 You go and you hate yourself。 It's stressful。

 It's annoying。 You'll barrel through a bit with your willpower。 But at some point， fuck this。。

 It's way better to like， you know， with this humanity， it's like actually have fun a bit。 Enjoy it。

 Make it sustainable。 Make it part of your life， part of who you are。 And then you'll stick at it。。

 You know， this is why also the turnover rate in the pickup community is so big。 Every six months。

 80% of you are gone。 It's a new 80% that comes in。 Very few stick at this long term。 Why？。

 They just don't find a way to make it sustainable。

 They don't find a way to have fun when they're out。

 They don't find a way to get out of their own way。， Yes。

 Sometimes you present yourself and she likes you and you connect。

 Sometimes you see that there's no connection and you just walk away。

 There's a real one middle where you think you can make her like。， Law number six。 We'll get to it。

 Yeah。 Yeah。 Think when， when， and then being relatable。 You know， it's like。

 my humor is pretty out there。 But there's also that area， as you said。

 in between where you have to be socially aware。， I may， you know。

 say something that's really extreme。 Something is not that extreme。

 But they're both still congruent to me。， So sometimes I'll go up。 I'll say something extreme。

 She's like， I'll slow it down。 I'll slow it down some more until I reach that point where if I slow it down anymore。

 it's no longer congruent。， We'll get to it。 Yeah。 In that case， it's like sitting home and like。

 you know， K with rejection。 It's like it's， it's really accepting this reality where that little world of you never getting rejected doesn't exist and it'll never exist。

 And that's fine。， You know， as you keep hanging onto it。

 you're always going to be feeling like shit because it will never happen。 You know。

 a world of no rejection will never happen。 A world of no discomfort will never happen。。

 And that's what creates all this resistance。 You're attached to this world。 Maybe， you know。

 you've been conditioned to believing in it。 That's a lot of pickup marketing。

 You'll never get rejected again。 Really？ This world of no rejection ever again。， But， you know。

 you really need to get the premium package for that。 You're still getting rejected。

 Here's the next premium package。 You know， this will reduce it by 70%。， You're like， okay， no。

 you're always going to get rejected。 But the key is like， let go of those like mystical realities。

 Your rejection， zero discomfort。， You're always going to have it。 You can choose how it affects you。

 Because the rejection isn't that bad。 In and of itself is an event。

 Usually it's just like nice to me。， It's you beating yourself up or the beliefs that follow from that that bring you down。

 If someone told you from the start， rejections the shit。 It's awesome。。

 Would you feel bad if you got rejected？ No， you'd probably be high-fiving your friends。 Fuck yeah。。

 Okay。 So， you know， something to think about。 It's like what， you know， weird。

 unrealistic realities are you hanging onto。 And then also just being okay with it。 And be like。

 okay， why do you need it？， I mentioned before that approval。

 What's so bad if you don't get that approval？， Because what's the assumption there？

 You're incomplete。 You know， it's like that old。 There's no reason why you're not enough。。

 It sounds very simple， but if you actually think about it， you're like， oh， it's true。

 Most of us we're going up like we're not enough。 And then we feel happy when we get that approval。。

 But guess what？ If you get that approval， you can also lose that approval。。

 So you're always going to be tense。 And even if you get the girl， you'll be tense。

 And this is why most guys lose their girlfriends。， They manage to hold it in for a bit。

 They get the girl。 They're like， yes， I got the approval。 And then they freak out。

 I can't lose the approval。 You might have that even in an interaction。， Usually， guys go in， bang。

 The girl reacts well。 And they freak out because they don't know how to deal with the girl reacting well。

， They're like， now what？ Can't lose it。 Done。， Guys will get this two after a make out。

 Usually they take a make out as a huge sign of approval。 They kiss the girl。 Now what？， Lose it。

 Anyway， experience that。 Like you kiss the girl and then just dies down。 Lose it。 Yeah。 Cute。 Yeah。。

 Okay。 So let it go of this like need of approval and being okay with not getting it and realize the。

 hey， why do you need a approval to feel like you're enough？。

 Why do you even need a girl to feel like you're enough？ Why are you not enough right now？。

 Something to think about。， Okay。 And that fear too。

 if you always trail it down to like the core is like that fear of being alone。。

 Or fear of being isolated。 You think if you get rejected， you'll just end up all alone。。

 And you just keep clinging and clinging。 If you're okay with being alone。

 now there's no longer that fear。 Now it's fine。， Another one's your ego。 Okay。

 Where it kind of links to the approval。 You want to validate whatever image you have of yourself。。

 And as long as you have an image to validate， you're going to be getting in your own way。， You know。

 and that could be a good image， could be a bad image。

 As long as you're trying to get a certain reaction， you're in your own way。。

 Something to think about。 What reactions are you hoping to get？ Why do you need them？

 Let go of them。， The big ones labels。 For example， bean out of states or approach anxiety。

 That'll stifle you。 Bean out of state。 What I always say is what's so bad about bean out of state？。

 Who says it's bad？ If someone told you from the beginning of time， bean out of states to shit。

 you don't want to be in state。， You do not want to be in state。 Bean in state is horrible。

 How would you feel if you're out of state？， You'd be happy and funny enough you'd be in state。 Okay。

 As soon as you feel good， bean out of state， you're in state。， Something that really keep in mind。

 As soon as I'm out of state， I just feel fucking awesome。 And then I'm in state again。

 So I'm never out of state。， You're going to keep having state crashes。

 Emotions always come in waves。 You're going to have them throughout the night and throughout the interaction。

， You're going to keep having approach anxiety till the day you die。 I still have approach anxiety。

 However， it doesn't affect me the same way。， That's the key。 It's how does this affect you？

 What labels do you have placed on them？， Most people view it as bad。

 And that's where they feel horrible。 You have approach anxiety。 Shit， I have approach anxiety。。

 And it just， you know， starts this whole chain of just negative emotions。 A state crash。 Same thing。

 You have the state crash。 Is it really that bad？ No。， But what makes it bad is you've been like。

 fuck out of state crash。 Stupid idiot。 Fuck shit。 Don't。 Don't。， Learn to let go of that。 Okay。

 Labels， expectations are huge。， Expectations kind of go hand in hand with like wanting that approval to reinforce a certain image or to have certain references。

， If you're going out， you might have experienced this。 You're really excited to go out one night。

 Tonight's going to be the shit。 It's usually not that good。。

 Because you're too attached to that outcome having an awesome night out。。

 Guys will experience this sometimes say New Year's Eve。 It's like New Year's。 Better be awesome。

 And this like， yeah。， You know， and it's sometimes those nights where you're like， uh。

 who knows what will happen， whatever。 And then you get surprised。 Because there is no expectation。。

 You're not clinging on to certain events or reactions to validates that amazing night。

 You're hanging on to so much。， What is your， your main， your。

 your both point that you're not having a state crash？。

 Learn how to feel good no matter what you feel。 Feel good about feeling bad。

 Feel good about being low energy。 Feel good about being high energy。。

 Feel good about being in your head。 Except at all。 Because that's the key。， You know。

 in letting go of that label to a viewing state is being super high energy， super outgoing。

 That's not safe。， So counterintuitive to embrace the negative。 Yeah。， But that's the key。 It's like。

 so you have the negative say crash。 You resist it。 So now there's the extra resistance。。

 Then there's you beating yourself up。 Then there's the anxiety。

 Then there's the outcome of trying to be in state again。， Then there's you not getting it。

 It's like that's the downward spiral。 It's something you're like out of state。 Hell yeah。。

 Out of state game。 Now you're in state。 You know。， Ways you're said than done， but it's big。

 Learning how to embrace all that。， The same with like even running out of things to say。

 As soon as like on a small scale， you can just tell the girl， hey， I ran out of things to say。。

 Suddenly that's gone。 But we resist。 Huge。 Okay。 So be aware of those labels。

 Nothing wrong with approach anxiety。 Nothing wrong with out of state。， Embrace that feeling。

 Approach anxiety open。 Approach anxiety game。 Out of state game。 Make that work。 Feel good about it。

， Another one scarcity。 And this is like a huge， huge one。

 And probably one if you work on it in terms of the practical side。

 that'll get you out of your own way big time。， Okay。 So scarcity of time is one。

 And the most important one is scarcity of women。 So what does that mean？， Say you're out tonight。

 And there's usually not。 You know， the clubs or bars。

 especially here are not necessarily packed with tens。。

 So you go out and you may see like two or three。 Or none。 Not getting two or three。

 So you see two or three。 And because of that， there's scarcity of women。， You're like。

 here's the 10。 Here's my one shot， one chance。 I cannot fuck this up。 There's a lot at stake。

 You fuck it up。 Now you're left with nothing。， That will stifle the fuck out of you。

 If you knew you had infinite tries， like say you went out， there was infinite tens。， Oh god。

 All that stress， all that blockage would be gone。 But that scarcity stifles you big time。

 No matter who you are。 Here's your one shot man。 That girl。 There she is。 Don't fuck it up。

 You're gonna just done it。， You can even fuck with your wing。 You go out tonight。

 Just keep whispering。 Don't fuck it up， man。 Don't fuck it up。 Don't fuck it up。

 That'll stifle you like that。， So how do you get rid of that？

 How do you get rid of that scarcity of women？ Learn how to have equal amount of fun with all women。

 That's the way out。， It sounds counterintuitive， but that's the key。

 I've been talking about this for years。 If you want to get the tens， you've got to game the twos。

 And you've got to have just as much gaming the twos as the tens。 Until you do。

 you're not going to get the tens。， The guy you only games， girls he finds attractive。 If he's good。

 can be consistent with sevens and eights。 And occasionally get a nine。

 But he'll never consistently get the nines and tens。 To get the nines and tens。

 you can't be so attached to it。， You can't buy into all those judgments of even viewing them as a ten。

 You have to be so loose， so carefree that they get drawn into you。

 They will not go for anything less than that because they just have way more fucking options and we do cooler dudes just don't give a fuck。

， Okay。 As soon as you have just as much fun talking to a two or a ten， they all become tens。， Now。

 guess what？ You do have those infinite chances， those infinite tries。 You fuck it up with one。

 You can talk to the two just as much fun。 It doesn't matter。 Way more carefree。

 way out of your own way。 Now you get the tens。， Ideally。

 the level above that is you have just as much fun by yourself。 No girls at all。。

 Then you get them all。 Okay。 Yes。， But easier said than done。

 Like you go up to her and you kind of fun， but you back your head， you know。

 like that goes way better。 Why？ Well， the question is too。 Why？， Because even if you have that。

 well， that's the thing because guys will understand。 They're just like， okay。

 I'm going to game all of them。， But then you game the again。

 I'm just using two to make the example you game a two and you're like。

 it's a two and you have faster game or it's a two。 I'm gaming her to get to the 10。。

 It has to be genuine fun equal amount of fun as the 10 where the night could end and you don't even talk to a 10。

 You just you don't sleep with her， but you're like。

 I could spend the whole night talking to this girl。

 I'd have just much fun as talking to a 10 the entire night。， What work on this， but basically。

 it's like you got to reach that point。 The story I use all the time as a guy who did a bootcamp with me in Miami a few years ago。

， He did like a bunch of boot camps。 And he went from like super newbie to intermediate。

 And that was the bootcamp he did in Miami。， And he was the guy who did become consistent with sevens and eights。

 He did。 He also hard did a bunch of boot camps work on himself back。

 but he couldn't get the 9s and 10s。， He comes out to Miami。 It's the five day alumni boot camp。

 The first three days， always allowed to talk to or the obvious girls there。， I'm like。

 no hot girls for you。 Not a single one。 Now picture from this guy's perspective。 He lives in LA。

 He had to take time off work for a week。， Buys fly out to Miami by the boot camp。 Get the hotel。

 It's model season in Miami where models from around the world fly in。

 Like it's the best time of the year to be there。， Like you'll see the hottest girls you will ever see。

 The two other guys on the program， fucking gaming up the models having a blast。， This guy。 No。

 you can watch him。 Here's a 40-year-old lady。 Go talk to her。。

 You can imagine the frustration and resistance this guy experienced until he trusted me though because he did a bootcamp maybe before。

， Until on night three， he finally fucking let go and came up to me as I dude。

 I finally had fun with these two old ladies。 Good。 Open the model。 Pulled。， Killed it since。。

 So it's more like an intermediate to advanced sticking point to work on。， If you're new， it's like。

 okay， well， do whatever。 But once you reach that point where you can get 7s and 8， not 9s and 10s。

 the solutions gain the ugly ones。， And once you have just much fun。

 that's when you'll encompass and get them all。 Because what happens to you is you get rid of that judgment。

， You go up to 10 to 10。 It's scary。 There's pressure。 You got to desensitize yourself to that。。

 Now there are two ways of doing this。 One is surround yourself with tens all the time。

 So you just become numb。， You could do that if you have access to them。 But if not here。 But if not。

 what's the other way？， Just talk to girls you don't find attractive until you have genuine fun with them。

 And as soon as you have genuine fun with them， you'd like go over that judgment on the unattractive girl。

， Like go over the judgment on one side。 It comes off on the other side too。。

 That's an easy way of going about it。， Okay。 And we'll keep talking about this。

 But two of the beliefs that hold guys back is one。 What will people think of me？。

 If you're out and someone sees you talking to girls not that attractive， having to blast。

 what are they going to think of you？， Are they going to think， oh， this guy's a low value。

 Why is he gaming this girl is not hot？ What's wrong with him？ What a loser。， But in reality。

 he makes you even higher value。 Why？ Because you're so cool， you can do this。。

 The guy who tries to be cool， he would not be able to have genuine fun with a girl is not that hot。

 He'd be too worried about what people think of him。， And they'd sense that。

 Even if he talks to them， he'd be like， ah， looking around。 Ideally， it's like。

 you're so ideas with yourself。， You're so comfortable with yourself， you can get away with it。

 It's the same with what we talked about before， like the low rules of say body language。。

 Or guys who try to be cool。 What you have to understand is trying to be cool doesn't mean try to act like a cool person。

 or what you think a cool person is。， How does a cool person act？ He just doesn't give a fuck。

 So to act cool means don't give a fuck。 The guy who's cool can get away with shit。。

 The guy who's cool can be like horrible body language。 He's not trying to be cool。

 That's a mix and cool。， If you're trying to be cool only talking to hot girls， you're not cool。

 Girls can sense that。， My favorite example is wedding crashes。 If you saw the movie。

 Vince Vaughn at the wedding dances with the old grandmother。。

 Did anyone think he's lowering his value having fun with the old lady who's not attractive？， No。

 it's like this guy's so comfortable。 He's a fucking life of the party。。

 The guy in the corner is like， where the hot girls？ Where the hot girls？ He's the lower value guy。

 He's the guy who's not cool。， Now that doesn't mean you sleep with them， but it does mean。

 and we'll get to this too， that you still flirt with them。， But there's two types of flirting。

 Flirting for the sake of fucking， flirting for the sake of flirting。， If I talk to you on a lady。

 it's very flirtatious。 Vince Vaughn in the movie， it's very flirtatious。。

 Is he planning on fucking her？ Maybe。 No。 The answer is no。

 You're just doing it just for the fun of it versus I'm doing this。

 and there's a possibility of it leading further。， What if you flirt with them on a contract？

 Like did she get hurt when you did enough？， Not if you're being honest and you're flirting for the sake of flirting。

， When I talk to girls in a hot， I'm teasing the fuck out of them。 But I also don't lead them on。

 Like I'm not like， ha-ha！ Like that！， You know， it's like， I just for the fun of it。 You know。

 it's like。。。， Think of it like this。 You tease hot girls。 If you have a sister。

 you probably tease your sister。 Or you teasing your sister to fuck her。， No。

 That's really the best way of putting it。 It's like。。。， If anyone who has like a little sister。

 or maybe an older sister， is like， you tease the fuck out of her。 Especially as a kid。 Like。

 you know， those sisters。， You're doing it just for the fun of it。

 It's the same with a girl you don't find attractive。， Treat her like your fucking sister。

 Fuck her round with her。 But it's not like， hey， we're gonna fuck。

 She'll sense it in the subtleties and nuances of the vibe。， And that's the key。

 It's all in the subtleties and nuances of the vibe。

 which we'll get to in the footage and in some exercises。， The same within a way。

 fucking jokes and self-amusement。， You can tell a joke to your friend just for the fun of it。

 It'll be very different in the vibe than if you're saying on a job interview and you're trying to make your boss laugh。

， Same joke， very different vibe。 You're still making a joke， it's different。 You're still flirting。

 it's different。， Okay， yes。， What about instead of looking at a store see there are lines mindset？

 What instead if you have one ten in the room， for example。

 and you saw it in the thriving athletes mindset， where you saw it as a challenge。

 rather than something to think the state of mind？， For example。

 what if it's you cultivated a personality which is where like， I'll thrive under pressure。

 kind of like you're going to the Olympics rather than I'll thrive？， Because I， you know。

 told the Olympics that I can try out for an institution。 What do you think？。

 It's gonna fuck you up big time because it goes against a lot of things。 One。

 you're putting a lot of pressure。， Two， you're placing her as this high value goddess on a pedestal above you。

， Three， you're viewing it as competitive， not collaborative。 You're not viewing her as on your team。

 You're viewing her as this， here's the big boss to conquer。， It's you versus her， not you and her。

 There's zero familiarity and you'll be way to attach that outcome， she'll sense it。

 she'll at some point。， Exactly， that's， that's so key I think because it's like playing to win。

 but also not like， like， top of the list of video winners game， it was easy to resonate with。

 but it's also very like an apprentice。， It's very different in how basically you can't really be that athlete competitive against not。

， It's very different。 Yeah， it's， it's， we'll get to this because I love these little nuances。

 You're playing to win， but the plane to win is a lot more subtle and vicious in a way。。

 So think of it this way。 It's like that gym-run quote。 Don't pursue a track。 You can't just pursue。

 You got to do shit that attracts that girl。 It's a lot harder。 It's a lot more subtle。

 but that's how you win。， So it's the same。 You got to be on top of your shit。

 but it's a lot more indirect in a way。。
