# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：7. 社会地位高的游戏：3. Part 3

特別觀看，這樣這支標準集回來，我處理這支標這個是因為我是做，在網上的自由洲舞蹈考究時，方程不傷的解釋，我在理論組建法下，ain strummed 作為僅是重要校、重要過程，我隨身動作專注那時。

是我一支國禮爸爸——， Book Series 我最喜歡裡面的，也可以 listed 集 ready，大家好 …，我聽話很生氣，所以在我的 hand system。

我 realise that the pattern of me physically escalated on a girl。

 the the point that helped me fuck her， was very short， it would help me get make-out。

 so it would help me get a lot of like， oh， now we're here at the door， right。

 I'm talking like years ago， I figured out where I can actually like physically escalate。

 and then actually close it as well， but the conversion rates， the percentage rates right。

 are so much lower than if you get， the girl and her friend escalate on each other。

 and then you just pull one of the girls or you pull them both，还有那些没有重要的柄价，不让不了自己爬贼，就让高级型会爆掉，正就是谈你。

但姜兰教练 joke，看看吗，如果 Davi，思克 STVA，会爆出很快的，又让小看到他， even she likes you，他 Excited，你知道这样，不泳大家，it's not bad。

 Liu，uf，过分，因为你在书记的事情，比賽他喜欢，什么的时候，你看那一辈子，F亭，这材质很动，就是很好，我想起这一词，我觉得最好，你切单的朋友，识形更好，心口，所以设案，那么咱们不承担。

使他们的笑话，目《想如何抢事》，你明白？， Which is fine， but you better rack up the quantity， the volume。

 Do you understand？， If you're gonna do the whole thing where you get them to escalate on each other。

 It needs to be very happenstance， casual like， Whoah what the。

 Like as soon as you tell them to do it and they start escalating， I'm immediately just like。

 Oh put your fucking， pussy away， put your nipple away， And like they're kissing。

 Like it's not even like even close that happening， Because then the girls are like， Wait what？。

 Oh you fucker， Like as if they， Like they thought that it might be out or something right。

 And then now we're joking back and forth， being really aggressive sexually with it。

 Do you understand？，但它完了致力使人犯改，你只能用它的型貌，同例能呈 faster，然後她就會再承拓，再談跟 friend 然後叫她参加，然後再 targeted，比較掌握。

非常清楚，你想見，其實請 context，你會偏健，你可以救過，沒部分，你對這個單族來香港，如果你行視，你一堆拉約，你會議會的，你有很多會場海地， serve，一個很好的 landscape。

我想起ICES，你會有甚麼做的，所以你於跃過來的，所以我想說，那裡還有事情，有時間你會記住，你不只好插我，？，接典鏡他們拆放，你好，！，我只是不知道，這位蕙蕙，當然喊了，那時候 看到，你害不了我。

asu膝，你會均持，我horily，她頭上是，我中心可以，你會明白，還會，多一人，我會，今晚，對啊，我是，改回，在這裡，我做一個，這個，你從。

這就是 the positive frame with the open a question， the positive frame means what？。

 she's going to act similarly to how I just said her for her act。

 and then I gave her the open a question， which means she's just going to give me some response。

 right， which means I'm going to reach 100% hook point with every girl。

 because I'm doing this segue response， this segue process， you understand？。

 so then she says what I asked where she's from， she says Philly， I'm going to say， I mean again。

 you don't have to say these literal words， this is a plug and play framework as we described earlier right。

 so then she says， Philly， oh， that's crazy， is it truly the same with girls from Philly？。

 are they all， you know， they're all raging sluts， whatever， you don't have to say like that。

 but is it truly the same with girls from Philly？， she's going to， she's going to go， no， it's not。

 we're not all， and then she's going to say we're not all Hicks， we're not all whatever right。

 and go， oh， that's funny， oh， is that your friend？， it is， oh， bring her over， right。

 she's either going to do one of two things， what is she going to do？， either bring her over or say。

 why， no， right？， then you say， oh， because I want you to。

 then you're going to catch about 50% of the girls just by you saying， oh， I want you to。

 she's going to bring the front over， right， you just justify anything and you're going to get it。

 and just make that in the path that's you actually putting both of them there。

 and then tell them to， oh， you know what？， okay， here's the thing too。

 when you tell them what to do， you have to be very clear what you're telling them。

 and it's not about the sexuality， remember I did the whole nipple thing with that guy， right。

 we told him to do with the friend or whatever， it's not about like， oh my god。

 I really want to see your nipple because it makes me horny， it's not that at all， right？。

 instead it's， right， instead it's holy shit， and then she says what？， what？， right。

 and then you say， oh， you fucking nipple， it's just huge， she's going to what？。

 and she has to also prize， right？， and then you have to say that exactly。

 but you say the sexual thing where you get buying back and forth， if you're just like hey。

 you know what？， you two should fucking make out， you're going to get like a one out of ten。

 like it would be about one out of ten I think， but you want 9 out of 10 or 8 out of 10。

 you build it up sexually， right？， okay， you guys ever do accidental keynote？， some me。

 that was funny， so accidental keynote is an amazing segue to get again like。

 of super oneradwierst of stuff， right？， so，hi， he goes to you， he is saying， he said no， he said。

 I had said Almost accidental keynote could of you guys， no， well accidental， oh， it's uncomfortable。

 he answered accidentalely twice， that's such an undertone， this whole deal。

 I just kill when I see guys going out there，用來的時候民黨員這裡，和軟滑男士，令他們想伍嘍，演唱巨han，日常難為平名呢，他們挺自殺的，伍阿家也是。

不會釣地到，要說是我的，者的爆 在內放，論文能做嗎，節目是，收元不懋，我不喜歡這段影片，對，我剛打算批評，然後他hape了幾個月，他給他得民調，他經過打了幾次，他又說了，嗯，是為了年輕兒子。

Miko問一下，你我說，他會較會說，但當時他也有指願，你會看到他，首iar手的速度，所以有的意URES，是這大幅就次門，如果它會警anka，一個運輔的活動，你在那個業績時，你把那毛眼羞。

想戀動、為哪個遊戲，跟今天更珍貴，你會罵掉這個，真是一個人獨一起扶口，對不對？ 我期待連戀動，15 maximum girls come in， right and we。

 the whole goal is like let's see how many we can fuck and she was one that we didn't and she's like you know what I mean like。

 Like the only way to even meet that girl is to be friends with the photographer be friends with the eight whatever it might be right。

 And otherwise you're just never gonna get access to them okay。

 The whole goal of this whole deal is do less work。

 leverage like you guys a couple of you guys have businesses right you're not the whole point of business is what to create leverage。

 So you do less work and make more money right or at least profit or whatever it might be。

 Why do we then look at game in this way where it's this like emotional metaphysical way no its processes put the process in place like I。

 Every Wednesday I'll have a threesome like 90% chance， Right。

 I'm not gonna say 100 because 90% chance because I put the process in place for me to have a threesome。

 It's usually tandem meaning I like it's it's gonna be with one girl I've already fucked right but the other one will be new every time right why because I have the。

 Perfect three-some fuck funnel in place for Wednesdays。

 There was one time like like Alex will tell you I get so like email and clubs sometimes around these fucking people。

 But like I still want the result。 I'm gonna go in there and get the result。

 I'll be in there for like an hour， I'll pull the threesome。

 I'll go pound it out and then usually I'll like go to the strip clubs like hang out because。

 My friends are there。 I'll hang out whatever right but the whole point is do less work higher yield。

 So when you get the girls do all on each other there's no creep factor for yourself， Right。

 but guess what they're not gonna like leave you and go fuck。

 It's only happened to be like once or twice， I just fucking like I got like I got her fired from her job because she pissed me off。

 I do not， She got a job another strip of so it's not a big deal， but， She was a cocktail actress。

 but they're rarely very rarely are two girls that you like get to ask that each other。

 Gonna be like oh my god。 We're so turned on and we're gonna leave you out of it now and then they go off and do their own thing。

 You're always gonna be brought along for the ride to the point where I even saved like super self-deprecating things。

 Because all I do is I want I want to I want to pound two girls out there at least eights。

 Right or like a seven and nine and like the seven will always help help me get the nine with me doing almost no work。

 Think about you do a ton of game you whip out all this crazy stuff you get the nine or the ten and。

 You did all this heavy work and you're like exhausted and like you already you had to open how many other ones to get it and then。

 Or you have the seven get you the nine， Like here here's the nine any ten I've ever had sex with besides one which has probably only been like。

 I mean a handful right to break proper tens were gotten for me by girls。 I did nothing。

 Which again is why I said to the very very beginning of this talk。

 It's a lot easier for me to show you guys how to get nine's and tens using social circle game then for you to get your own five to eights。

 You guys understand that now？， Right is that making more sense？， So train the seven to do that？。

 I mean I train the I train I train I， I I train the eight and the nine to do that in case any of them are hearing yeah。

 Yeah， no， I mean 100% aggressive training like seal team fucking six training， Yeah。

 the law every month that you date me the like I don't like I get it's crazy and create。

 I don't know how you could date me after a year or something because each each month there the it becomes more challenging。

 There's there's more girls you have to bring me there's a whole set up。 What's the what's the quote？

， I know what I know what I bring to the table。 So I'm okay eating alone。

 I tell that to like every girl like I'm like I'm let's like our one month romantic anniversary。

 Course here's a you if you don't I know it sounds kind of mean or whatever like I get like that。

 It sounds a little harsh or whatever if you don't do that you get nothing。

 Right or you get like scraps or or a lot less results。

 So if that if this is what you she's gonna respond to then okay。

 then this is what's gonna happen right， What you know the best the best attraction quoted the best pick up quote in the world is David D'Angelo's quote。

 I mean as little game as that guy actually has the quote is money the quote is money。

 You guys know it is a， Traction is not a choice wholly fuck like。

 That like most guys don't let that sink in like the girls are not choosing to be a track。

 Ask the girl what her type is like ask the next girl you fuck what her type is watch her not to describe you。

 Seriously she's not gonna describe you it doesn't happen she shouldn't be like wow yeah。

 Man boobs really long shitty hair and a very very average dick。

 That's what like no she doesn't say that like that no。

 Most of the girls that I fuck like black guys。 I'm extremely not black。

 What you are there you go right I want to see everybody doing these techniques and I want everybody to see that it's applicable everywhere。

 So I try these different cities and I'm doing the same techniques to build a social circle up right I have a pretty epic event tomorrow night。

 That's like 50 50 if it's gonna happen and I've been building it up just like all night。

 I'm like working on my laptop。 I'm like all I see if that could throw this event out。

 Let's see if I can make this happen and if it happens it's gonna be insane like unbelievably insane and I'm filming the whole thing for the deal right。

 You know again， it's it's got to be you get a lot better at selecting the people that you do that with right at first。

 You're like buying the drink for like someone who's you know。

 You have no connection with and then over here。 It's you're buying something。

 But you know you're or you may be not buying a thing。

 But you're spending the time to actually connect with the person and then you're like oh。

 it's not gonna work， Eventually you get really really good you get very very adequate at actually。

 Picking people out right away and like right now I can pretty much pick the guy in the bar that like I'm gonna connect with and like。

 I'm gonna want to buy the drink and then hope the rest of the city and you know we build some commonality or whatever right。

 Over time will just happen very quickly， Also make sure you're doing the multiple social circles once you get good at this。

 The next step is doing these multiple circles in different places so that the overlap kicks in once that overlap kicks in。

 Oh my god like it's great like， The overlap is high-matte damsels earring the overlap is how I met pair of silt and the overlap is how I met any。

 Celebrate like a real celebrity I've ever met it's from the overlap。

 It's not from the social circle， Different it might be fits different physical locations in a place like Miami LA Vegas。

 It could be of it could be multiple circles in the same club though because the club is a large。

 Right， so you have these multiple circles all happening at once， right again。

 It sounds I think it sounds super simple as I describe it。

 But when you're actually doing it someone's difficult to break yourself off。

 Right to do the multiple I had massive， For some an orgy anxiety up until this year。

 I was I've been pulling three stones for like four or five years， I。

 Had I had sober three some anxiety for a while， Right because from my first like two years。

 I was like getting a bunch of three stones my first two years of three sims， right？。

 I was living in Austin， Texas and it was literally like I don't I've got a。

 An apartment and I do these seven day immersion programs。

 This is like maybe five five years ago six years ago。 I get a， The apartment was right above a bar。

 You know how like you know， There's the the staircase that like in all centers like the the by-level type deal and like you kind of could just go。

 Right into the bar without even going to the street talk about logistics like I mean。

 I was just closing so many girls off of that off of logistics alone， Right。

 but that wasn't like that wasn't really like proper three-some game。

 That was just me like putting all the stuff in place which then guess what though gave me the abundant mentality。

 It allowed I literally did the wasn't good game。 I just put the product and have good state。

 I had terrible inner game， Right， There was nothing like mentally that was like going for me other than me being。

 Grigarius than me being clever to like put this in place with the logistics。

 I used to have a whole talk for about a year and a half。 I'd gave an entire layer to her。

 Like it's like an inner circle like later an inner circle kind of the same thing and then entire talk was off。

 No game at all just pure logistics。 How do you close the girls just off logistics and then using。

 Pure just the logistics and the compliance to have sexual the girls and then you watch all the all the。

 Attraction flow right off the back of the back of the back。

 Right off the back of that rather so yeah， I mean it's crazy when I see guys not using buy-in game investment based game and。

 Pre-selection， Like I would like the next time I come to Scottsdale。

 It's actually pretty close to Vegas。 I think about coming here a little more regular the next time I come to Scottsdale。

 I was on every single one of you should have a pivot， Guess what you know it's crazy about this too。

 Pivot's a girl that will help you pick up chicks。 Yeah， yeah soups， Any any other lightball， Yeah。

 oh， Shit accidentally accidentally， Cool， Yeah， yeah， yeah， I mean。

 Here's the thing if you the only time I ever get gonna go out to a club without girls or without a pivot to help me get girls。

 is gonna be when I'm like， With my buddies and we're just like there's some。

 Business things talk about or like maybe maybe he's going through some shit and like he just wants to like。

 I mean， I don't drink beer， but like he wants to like throw a few beers back and talk。

 I get I don't know like， Other than that。 I'm always gonna have girls in me like why why would you not？

， Like the the the night that I got this whole orgy thing on Sunday， right？。

 I had how many girls in white 12 10 something like that 10 or 12 girls in white that we're just sitting there。

 Let's say that you're super new to game right like you for example， right？。

 You're super new remember you're asking that question about how to get started with this shit。

 If you're going to get started off scratch， right？

 You can exactly network with the socialite in your town。

 You know like like like Belzerian like go on his wakeboard boat and then there's 15 girls are sitting there like you can't just escalate to that。

 Grant was Lake Havasu though。 Is that close to here enough？， That's like a fucking rager lake。

 right？， There's a couple guys that just are don't have the profile of some of the guys already described that are fucking raging and fucking girls on that lake。

 That you guys can just get on if I moved here within a week。 I'd be on some sick boat in that lake。

 Fucking some girl that I would forget about an hour later like so that would happen at some point you guys can all do that using all the stuff。

 I'm talking about right？， So for you right you have to you have to do the stuff that's very manageable。

 It's like the pivot for example， right？ You're probably not going to be like like what's your lake count is under three？

， Is it zero？， Around three？， Two and a half two， A solid integer of two。

 Let's go with that cool cool cool。 Hey， it's fine。 It's fine。

 I guarantee you somebody here with a less lake out than that， So it's fine。 Let's go， Got you， huh？。

 Who's that zero？ There you go。 See not accidentally， Are we clapping for this。

 Are we are we are we applauding virginity now？， Okay。

 So the SDD talk that got like awe but then the virginity。 Oh， yeah， let's clap for that， Okay。

 so so for you do what do you do for work？ You have a job？ What do you do？， Amazon。

 So the the tech company Amazon guessing。 Okay， Yeah， sweet like 30 billion。 Yeah。

 What do you do there， All day cool。 Are there any women that work there at all？ Yes， cool。

 Like if you're just getting started the easiest pivot in the world is co-workers because any co-worker will do what？

， No， no， but there's a thing it's called what it talks to you。 It's called happy hour。

 Like every co-worker， Huh what， So you've already been doing this or at work they gossip。

 At work they gossip or at the happy hour they gossip， They know that work。

 Perfect so now you already know they want to talk to you。 So guess what you do， You say hey。

 you want to go to happy hour because I'm really enjoying this conversation， Right。

 Who gives a shit right their girls who who like you both serve each other's purpose， okay？。

 So what do you do again anybody else who's just starting out fresh like there's a couple guys that we because we talked a lot of advanced topics so far。

 If you just started out fresh just do this， Okay， this is so easy just take some co-workers， huh？

 I would I would， No， no less less I hop a little a little more comfy than that right let's think um less I hop a little more。

 But， So what would be a place right what what has food is LFA and those all those country places。

 All those bullshit like they they serve food during that they have happy hour and they turn to a club all that will do。

 Like you guys got to be clean and up dude。 I would yeah the whole aids think here。

 I would have aids， No， you got a town that is made for it's fine。

 It's made for fucking seriously Scottsdale and Atlanta and Dallas are the three fucktowns。

 you understand that， Like three hottest like crazy more like concrete cowboy and Dallas go fuck yourself。

 That's better that's better than excess any day of the week and as a fucking like anybody in concrete cowboy。

 Now like Dallas Atlanta and Scottsdale are the fucktowns， amazing。

 crowd like these are the three cities。 I'll do a bootcamp here and like if all three boot。

 bootcampers cancel up so like oh I still got to go though for some reason。

 There's some they're amazing。 So not I hop why not I hop you tell me， No， no。

 I don't I want this to be super friendly basis， There's like the 45 year old fat like like。

 You know there's no girls there。 I mean unless you guys got some crazy like stripper。

 I hop where they go， Oh， All right， so that's where you want oh when you turn to me when， Wait。

 where's future？ Oh， in a few days also I know somebody not future who could also sort you out of that stuff。

 Feet huh？， Oh， did you yeah， that's a clap， Yeah， so no， no for real though。

 Let's get back to this right。 So I so is that way you said I hop because the age thing。

 Is the is the age or the reason why you said I hop again？

 Anybody who's a beginner this stuff listen this because we already covered the advanced stuff。

 So I want to cover the beginner stuff a little bit right， Um， by the way。

 I'd rather take a beginner and crush it with him than a guy who's like a little bit more like more than average or。

 You know， that guy's already has all these like crazy woo inner game shit in his head。

 You we could just be like no， let's just stop that like let's get the inner game once you've actually achieved all this pussy。

 And then guess how good your inner game is gonna be， I。

 It's good right instead of it being this like facade if you talk into a mirror telling yourself how great you are。

 Like mentally jerking off on your face， right like come on so instead of that where do you take them instead of I hop。

 Not starbucks。 Give me a place me a name of place， All right， wait， we got stingray。 We got gaysha。

 Are they both like trendy and country like okay， They're not like they're not like a hole in the wall with amazing sushi there。

 All right， quite quite quite let's see have five places for these guys okay five places okay。

 Hold on five places five places five places where where do the contiest most arrogant most pretentious horrors go women。

 Sorry， so lfe bottle blonde or no not as much， So bottle blonde gaysha something gaysha what's the other one right these down right them down。

 about， LFE gaysha sushi， Cata it's all right what's that， You said the w， That's pretty good here。

 There and then there's a lot of cool everyone else if you're a beginner listen to these places if you're gaming at any bar。

 Other than the place that he just mentioned or that we just mentioned here you're wasting your time。

 Cuz you won't get as much bang for your buck right here's the if you're gonna do if you're gonna actually tell yourself。

 That you're gonna build on each interaction do proper social game you actually want to get 9s and 10s。

 You want to go to the cutiest place you're selling by country club cunts the fuck boys， Yeah。

 right the hot chicks huh， Yeah， I'm a girl from the real conno girl here's good， In ZTA， I love ZTA。

 That's just bomb， But the ones in fashion， They're right next to each other there's also you guys listen to focus leave this guy's talking listen up to him。

 Like three bars right now all right next each other， Yo。

 you're you're literally talking during the like the most important thing is entire thing。

 He's literally telling you where to go。 It's just listen to him real quick。

 And he works for law firm。 So he and he's doing a mass tour。 So he's got to be a cool guy。

 All right， hey who's in the inner circle， I'm the inner circle。

 I've been I'll put it on the inner circle， Cool， He's a professional， Yeah。

 Google in the file is a spreadsheet for menus。 I'll update it。

 Can you put it can you put a column for cutie like a cutie ratio？ Yeah。

 no like literally order them in terms of like how uncomfortable he would feel walking in by himself。

 Seriously you want to go to the place where you just， Yeah。

 so much you do we're okay to tie this off right the one more point to this， I don't get what， Okay。

 no， no， stop stop stop。 Nobody say a word right now stop stop stop stop。 Nobody say a word。

 Listen to me， Virgin listen to me。 Listen to me。 Virgin。 Listen to me， Yeah， yeah， Listen， right？

 It's where the hottest girls go and they're gonna be the rudest to you。 That's when by country。

 You got it and the dudes that apparently in Scottsdale where they're getting like steroids shot other ass and like。

 It's gonna be dudes that's like tight shirts walking around。 It's gonna be very very arrogant girls。

 You got it？ Yeah cool go for it， Yeah， keep on this is a real word about that。

 I didn't make this out。 This is what the this is what the cunts call themselves， So keep going。

 I think you're explaining right well just finish。 I think you're doing a great job don't don't hey dude。

 Don't belittle your point。 Oh my guys don't belittle your point， This is why your lay count is too。

 Almost three two， Right because you're holding back your thought just no right just just make your thought。

 All right， yeah， how do I you know get them to introduce them more？， Where are girls basically？

 I gotta do like a whole oh one's own spill on you， right， The he he he basically went like this。

 He's like well， how do I get them to kind of， introduce me to， Oh， girl or two， Right。

 If oh one was here， you'd have you like scream down in the fucking street to make sure you get your your balls back。

 Right， Seriously， Okay， you seriously this is what's happening， Okay。

 You do you have to tell them you have to tell them exactly what type of girl you like and say what's what but you have to do the leading the leading stents。

 As I said earlier right you have to be like hey， what's the problem out of nowhere？

 Just cut them off， Okay， what's the what's the problem？ What's going on here？。

 I started on purpose on in that situation to make it more natural。

 So I don't just sound like fucking sociopath， because what what's um what's going on here and then the girl says。

 What do you mean？， Why are you not getting that girl to get over here and hang out with us because I think I missed。

 Understood something。 I think I am confused， I think I don't quite understand what's happening here。

 right？， You see I'm like exaggerating。 I'm being kind of kind of sending about it。

 That's what then the girl's like oh okay， you like her and then that's when you go。 I mean， Kind of。

 And then you go and then she's gonna really you like that one。

 But I don't know that one and you point her out and she's gonna go okay， And then you say。

 Chop chop， And then she go oh really you mean it and you go no I was just fucking with you and then she's go oh okay。

 Yes， I meant to go， And then she's go okay and then you should go hey， what's your name？

 I think you're really pretty， And then you and then if the girl doesn't want to do it just literally say go up and tell her she's pretty literally if a girl's like。

 If a girl's nervous about hitting on other girls and doing this probably just say just tell the girl to say this one line。

 Because I've trained girls to be just beasts and I've also done。

 If you're gonna do the whole like co-worker thing just to make it easier on yourself。

 Literally just say hey go up and tell her that you think she's pretty， nothing else。

 They will just do the rest you understand， They'll talk for an ungodly amount of time like an ungodly long amount of time。

 You'll be really annoyed because you're sitting there being like are they ever gonna bring them over to like。

 Do I ever get to eat what's happening here？， Right you huh you fucking wait you just wait because then guess what ends up happening。

 They just every minute that they're talking makes your introduction that much better， Right。

 Yeah money looks don't matter you can look like me and fuck these maximum girls that I'm fucking you can look like me and fuck。

 tawny and Chloe， Right， Playmate of the year last year like you can look like me and do that and spend his little money as I do if you do all this shit。

 right， You can't just have presence and then fuck the ten without the looks and the money and then without the gain like。

 Yes， some point you got to pick something to use you understand。

 So the best thing that I can get the best way I can get you guys results in quickest amount of time is to force pre-selection down your throat。

 As you are saying right right just the whole idea of like wait why haven't you been doing that all along。

 Right you kind of probably have a little bit sometimes。

 But why are you not like forcing that fucking thing to happen right。

 You do seriously the results will be unbelievable you literally just want you guys will start snapping me situations。

 And you'll be off in the corner and just be like this is happening in front of me。

 Do I like jump in now do I when do I wait my dick out。

 I don't even my pivot started sucking me off and then she got like her tongue up my ass。

 I'm confused， Um like I， And then you're like oh do I fuck my pivot what do I do right so for you right just wait wait wait wait。

 Then your coworker will bring the girl over and that's it。

 Guess what that will also do with your relationship with the coworker your pivot or any other girl you bring。

 Strengthen the shit out of it， Guess what these girls want to do they these girls their favorite thing in the world is to help you guys get laid。

 They love it， They're just talking about the shit non stop with their girls， It's even easier。

 They ask you what type of girl you're into that's better。

 I have to do this whole like song and dance of like， You know。

 Yeah you guys like the talks so far though， Yeah， You guys like the talks before， Yeah， Cool。

 You guys like the talks for maybe look good come on， What's up what's up accident on。

 And I'm gonna call you version for the rest of the day go for it。

 I mean like dude like there's a reason why there's a reason why I'm a virgin guarantee in Vegas immersion。

 Like， You stay for four four four weeks one month， Not two weeks， four weeks right。

 And if you don't lose a virgin in four weeks you you can either stay for two months or I'll give you your your money back。

 You got his half of the two and a half you have the half。

 So what's your question then we'll take up his break， All right。

 So like we live like a smaller city， And so we don't have like place like the same like you guys see like big clubs。

 Sure， We do have like a VIP kind of because we have like a big college town。

 So I'm trying to see if we can do like the same kind of seating like kind of daytime。

 So like we have like big like fraternities that have like huge of like nine to ten like super sluts。

 We're all like cosplay， Now we're at where that's a U。A。， To sum it to sum， No you guys。

 So we're trying to see that's our exclusivity for us I think。

 And so I'm trying to see is there like， A good way to go about doing the day， Yeah。

 she's I was in Oclare Wisconsin the other day， Yeah。

 the other day was like probably a year and a half ago， My my， Yeah， Um。

 Oclare Wisconsin is my least favorite town in the world。

 Because I grew up on a farm like 45 minutes from there。

 So I went there and like low and behold I'd find like， Like the raging party horror。

 And like who's just like going super crazy， And， And she makes moonshine and I ended up like hook it up with her right。

 Um like with like the hot Wisconsin hot， Slut whatever right um but the thing out to the thing to think about is even that。

 Bullshit-ass horrible heinous place had a VIP area。

 All right the reason I talk about the bottle service stuff and these these high-end clubs。

 Is because there's more bear to entry to those places that if you can do it there。

 Then you can do it in Oclare Wisconsin or in， To， Tuxen to song with the fuck it。 There you go。

 Right so， It's not necessarily tables。 It's not necessarily。

 You know you can DC right DC is what has stunning girls stunning， Not the clubs， No。

 I mean I like Indian girls right dot not feather， Um， I'm all about it。 I like Indian food。

 But like no there's there's no there all at the charity dinners。

 They're all at these stupid political fundraiser bullshit right。

 So you get into those places right you use the same exact skill set to get into those places。

 I got into the DJ booth with the fucking stupid little hat right that helped me fuck those two girls。

 That are way hotter than I am， I think we can all agree on that right so it's the same shit。

 So it's a small town you got to figure out what's the VIP area right is it the fraternity is sorority is it。

 There's there is probably some watering hole there。

 There's probably some bar some nightclub that like， That they still go to and by the way。

 Before we take a bathroom break as well， The whoever said they got like Thursday Friday Saturday。

 I think most weeks of the you reverse the shit out of that if you can。

 You want to make this work twice as good immediately go out instead of Thursday Friday Saturday go out Sunday Monday Tuesday。

 The only people that matter go out those days， Not nobody。

 Yeah I get it right watch the quality you know I go out every Thanksgiving in Christmas。

 Because it's suddenly only a sea of hot girls， Because it's it's only girls that work in the industry。

 They don't give a fuck about their Thanksgiving dinner and they want to rage that day。

 What that's better than Valentine's then pay me in a single wrong Valentine's day。

 Me and a hot girl on Thanksgiving who's not at home eating turkey。

 Are you kidding me that's amazing， Right， So that's some light bulbs to click off click on this right the point is you to do this regularly week by week。

 You go out on industry nights does anybody down do you guys know about this？。

 Anybody know about industry nights someone you you guys got all right YouTube fuckers do。

 So like instead of Thursday Friday Saturday I would just go out Sunday。

 Just Monday and you have way better success， Right。

 Way but the girls are gonna be hotter by at least one or two points right because all the hot girls you wanted to pick up during the week are now partying right。

 Way less dudes and the dudes that are there already fucking so they're not haters， Right。

 It's the bar managers the fucking bartender who's already railing plenty of girls。

 He's too busy about the fucking girl he nutted in two two weeks ago into the bar to give a shit。

 You know like they don't give a fuck， You know guys that are already make friends guys who are already getting laid that already have the abundance that already have the social。

 Historical stuff figured out and then it's exponential effect。 Okay。

 That's why the whole point of this product， Right。

 but I mean whether you guys buy it or not there's no like pitch for you guys the whole point of those when the big guys who do buy it。

 It's it's like 20% content 80%， Connected connectivity of the actual value arbitrage。

 Right because I have a limited bottles in Vegas and like Miami kind of right well。

 I don't really care about that， But there's definitely guys who know hot girls。

 Who would love to do that right well？ How do we link that up？， How do we as like a PUA community？。

 Soar all that shit out。 I mean guys all the time that are crushed pussy， but they're just like hey。

 I just um just in New York， Um， I just met Jim this weekend， Um， Jim's a fairly successful guy。

 I met a awesome PUA who's in my program for a month。

 He learned from me for 30 days straight right just turned 21 years old， He's uh。

 we got one more year left to school right he's gonna be successful。

 But he's a college kid he's looking for like uh， he's asking me about where specific stairwells in New York City are to fucking。

 What you don't think that like I probably have a few friends that would let him like use a spare bedroom in their place if he brought a few girls over。

 What？， Of course， right， but how do we how do we actually do that？

 It's the intercircles aren't really the place for it， It's not really like hey。

 I got this hottie right now。 Is there any good？， Is there any dude with money that has a second bedroom with with an after party？

， I'll give you at whichever girl you want that's a pretty fair exchange of you ask me。

 Right and I have a list of a lot of guys in New York that have I have a list of dudes in New York that have like multiple apartments that they just use as。

 Fuck pads that like any PUA could fuck it， But how do I disseminate that to people？。

 I only want to disseminate that if the guys actually are learning this proper social circle stuff。

 And then once everyone goes through the same course they all are actually enveloped in the same stuff。

 They all are doing the same you know， they're not gonna wreck each other social circles right。

 Which is kind of like that once that happens and that's my future vision of all this stuff。

 Because I think the sales pitch on actually doing the concepts is pretty simple right？。

 I don't think I have to convince you guys like go out with girls。

 Right go as many as possible right just do this shit for you。

 I'm telling you just do the same stuff。 I just had him do right and don't do any of the PUA shit。

 Seriously if you're if you're a virgin or you're five ladies or less just literally do this because you do this and tell your pivot your a virgin。

 Yeah， you'll be late in 48 hours， You're not a fucking nation are you kidding me I do it sometimes and I'm not a virgin。

 What it's amazing， Seriously girls want to get you laid but they're not this enemy right especially the hotter they are and the more successful the guy is the more that they just want to help you。

 right， It's it just it blows my that's the one I think one thing I think my parents fuck me up on that I thought that like people were kind of I kind of grew up thinking like people were out to get you kind of。

 I grew up very religious and then like also people I mean this whole like everyone like watch out for everyone。

 They're out to get you and all this kind of shit， Yeah。

 if if if they're losers right if if they're people that like are already negative vibe already。

 But people who are the more successful you climb that ladder。

 Guess what it gets nicer at the top right also， Do you don't have to bang those four fives and sixes。

 Right this is the last thing I want to I guess I'll add a straight question right but for you in the bathroom break four fives。

 You don't you don't have to pound the pavement you can just go straight to the eight sines tens。

 Let's go where they go like literally go out where they go， That's simple right um。

 One last thing on that the um who knows what art basilis who goes to art basil。

 Anybody so like who here knows what Miami spring break is。

 Everybody come on Miami spring break okay art basil is what is it December Jim you ever got art basil？

， I feel like you've gone there before， Yeah like art basil compared to Miami during spring break no comparison。

 I'll never miss an art basil， Super hot girls， but like most people don't really know about it。

 That's ultra-cunti， It's in Miami。 It's like a like a art show basically throughout the city。

 But they have like the huge museum like Jay Z and Beyonce go to every single one of them like。

 I'm they have these super fancy like watch companies like um。

 I always get in through I've a friend who works at Hubelow。 So like super expensive watch company。

 They um they have these like these Hubelow parties these pop-ups they have artists like do all the paintings in the shit in front of it。

 And these super hot girls go there because they just love it and guys don't really give a fuck。

 So it's like five one-girls guy ratio like that's high-barried entry right it's one of the main concepts。

 I talk about the higher-barried entry thing that you do the rest is easy。

 You can literally just be like hey， what's up？ How's it going？ Because you're in the thing， right。

 Once you're in that space you already have the attraction and the comfort you built it at the same time。

 Uh your question then we'll head out。 So if you're going out and your goal is like creating a social circle instead of just like cool approach big。

 If you get into the venue or you just gonna go for the people who work in the。

 Asher like the waitresses and the bartenders and things like that。

 Are you just going for like the hot girls？， Are you going for everyone who looks like their high status and then like I guess the second part of that is like。

 If you're gonna take a girl's number， Is it more like having to do with。

 Uh something social like when you like when you take the number obviously you want to like see some type of meetup。

 Yeah， so you're seeing like maybe like a party or a time bridge not even the seed you shove the seed down the throat so much。

 It's called a time bridge a time bridge is not a seed。

 It's a who-what-why-and-where of the next time you guys are going to meet up with each other。

 If I don't get that I don't consider it a valid number close。

 I'm not going to like drop her a missed call， Because then she's going to， Drop me in no answer。

 So would you time bridge with somebody who's working on like the busiest nights？， Yeah。

 so okay so it's different right so if they're working right， Check us out remember the Sunday。

 Sunday Monday Tuesday happy days right， Okay， um， You know exactly where they're going to go out。

 Who in here already right now knows where industry goes out on Sunday raise your hand。

 Look at it look at it right here， Okay， well look at all the people right was it eight people right where did the industry go on Sunday give me one place。

 Okay， should go go and is that like the place or is it like two， Yeah。

 well happy happy hour all day okay， so it's the cut it they got specials for the cons， I'm not。

 I'm not， I'm not going that way， Okay， so like the same bullshit little area right okay， So yeah。

 yeah， Just go out， That's the way to go out okay， Okay， so Scottsdale。

 Fortunately is a strip club city as well， And they're not I don't think they're very good here。

 I've never been to one here， But I just know it's a strip club city like Dallas like Atlanta。

 If I moved here for the first time， I would go to the strip club。

 I would act like a belligerent fuck one night， They would all be like they would all have a story which is。

 The next part that we talk about is how to create stories with people。

 You create a story with somebody， I'm kind of like how I did with to get into that makeup company。

 You just create a story with somebody， One time， They will always bring it up and they will always bring you to certain things because they're like oh that's that fucking guy。

 Like every time I hang around all these different people I've networks with and all these different girls。

 They just look at me that all that's that's Luke that's that fucking guy， Right。

 What does that mean that fucking guy means that we had one epic nights together right with one cool story that we shared together。

 And then never again， but now we he'd they just keep bringing me around all this cool stuff。

 Because I keep adding value to them and I don't want anything in return， Understand cool。

 So the Sunday thing， Imagine you you meet a coctubators or bartender and you invite her out。

 To the Sunday thing in a group setting you're like hey a bunch of bunch of us are doing this thing。

 What do you think she's probably gonna say， She's probably gonna she's probably gonna say。

 Ha ha I'm， Already doing that right you got like you got like a 25% chance 25 like it's like a third right the right one for son is。

 I have a thing about when doing myself because I fucking drunk friends that do this every fucking son dance fucking amazing。

 It's at R&R in Scottsdale。 It's a $30， Allers， farmers from Moses from 11 to 3 they have so in a lot of man。

 Well， it's I'm saying there's， I'm saying there's how people fuck them there。

 So if you're gonna do it。 That's what I was yeah， You know。

 I want to know is this how bitchy are the girls that go there。 That's all I care about。

 Conti like so I don't need the serostitutes。 I want country like I want the girl。

 I want the girls like 23， And like super fucking hot like I want I want I want huh。

 Breakfast club there you go。 That's where we should all be going into Vating。

 We should call this a cock we should literally I like regularly fuck fitness models you like the girls in the snap they were fitness models right I'm not a fitness model。

 But the second you said the fitness models are gonna be there。 I immediately like I don't get phone。

 I'm going there breakfast club done we're going I'm going fine。 I got it out of you guys。

 We fucked around this gaysha and alhefe shit and now。

 How are you going to wait on the weekends perfect give me a three give me a three hour wait in a patio that you can open on easily。

 In a bar that starts coffee is there a place with an hour wait two hour， Fuck if it's， No。

 okay perfect。 So we'll stay with that then right seriously breakfast club。 We will all go together。

 We'll call the cock fest success， Seriously， you fucking kidding me， Dude seriously it。

 Done you got to go to the place that is if you're going to use social leverage then you have to go to a place where you can maximize social leverage。

 You don't want to do， Nine and ten games socially get social circle game all this if I'm talking about at your local dive bar。

 Right because it will still work， but you're going to get a much larger dimension return on the effort you put in you understand that。

 Cool cool cool， Last one bathroom because that last one then and then you can ask me to come back and go for it。

 Is your pivot have to be like as high as the grocery no no they never almost never are my pivot is always beautiful and my exact type。

 but like the pivot usually will， No， no usually you're fucking up， Yeah， Yeah。

 I mean that's the point， Right， Yeah the goal is to have a pivot they're like you just think is awesome like they like you like you would enjoy hanging out with her as much as you hang out with like your buddy。

 Like that's cool， and then like you don't have to fuck but you can and like and there's like a very specific category there for pivot。

 That's great， And looks she just needs to look a country right she needs to know how to do fucking makeup if she doesn't teach her。

 What's seriously like I've taught so many girls how to do it not me personally。

 But I'm like no no you could be hot。 Let's fix this though。 Let's do it。

 When you show them the respect to do that watch what ends up happening back。

 It's crazy too many people just don't communicate with each other like how many female friends you guys probably have after this talk。

 That you already know like oh there's that one girl that would kind of do this with me she'd go out with me。

 She'd help me you all probably can cut think of one person even the work thing right but you maybe have not not actually gone out with that。

 Personal yet right or at least not like with this kind of direction or focus。

 They will they will wonder it's crazy would you just open them up and communicate to them and actually tell them。

 Hey， this is what's happening， It's great。 They're like oh really I never knew there's so many girls I've done this with and they're like the whole time。

 They're just like I didn't even know you like that type of girl。

 And I was like this is when I came up with the you army when I was like oh I'm gonna call this something like you。

 Military is like militaristic or something like it's gonna be called the you army because like what do you mean you didn't know I。

 I make these jokes about Hispanic girls that I like how do you not know that's what I like I didn't know we just never talked about it。

 All right， well now we're having that conversation right。

 So you have to have that conversation with all the girls that you know and all the girls that you're meeting。

 Okay， the coolest thing about these in they could do I would go to strip club last thing about that point。

 I go this fucking strip club。 I'd act like a buffoon number close like 15 those strippers right， um。

 And then， They would all like they would look at that night as being this like epic memorable night right and then on the industry nights。

 I would invite them out with me the clean ones not the fucking dirty last fucking looking ones right。

 They're not the right like horror ratchet， but not like super ratchet right I want I because then what happens？

， I'm happening do guys are always like why are all these girls just like。

 Dance like I'll go to like excess or marquee or something and these girls just start coming up to me。

 And those are like hoping the shot at me or they're like they'll move their titty。

 I can just start sucking on it and shit， And then guys just like you're a game god。

 Like just like regular people not pways and I'm like yeah， what what it took me like， Almost a year。

 I think to realize wait。 They don't know that those are strippers， That I've picked up before。

 They're just like wait how are these regular girls come up like what strippers are fun。

 You don't have to respect them if you don't want to， But they're， Seriously， but they're fun。

 They're awesome right， but just not the dirty what looking ones， Yeah。

 I know I would I was like last thing on that like I would bring them。

 I would bring like the cleanest like five strippers and they like they know they hate each other。

 They like to go out and packs the cleanest five strippers in the city。

 I would make fucking love me and then take them to this fucking country place and just watch all these like girls who should be strippers。

 But like oh， they're too good for it watch them all like seriously watch them all just be like who the fuck is this guy。

 I'll intentionally wear like a sloppy shirt。 I'll like I'll sit down。

 I'll like oh like my hair will be all like fucking like this like it is all the time right and then even more so。

 they're just like， What who is and I'll like be yelling at them。

 I'll be like hey go buy me a fucking drink get over there， And she's like oh my god。

 You just asshole。 Yeah， you're a fucking cunt， Hurry up before you pussy。

 It's too loose and these go to these regular girls are just like。

 What the who is this fucking fucking guy， But like like like cocked wages but strippers especially they'll like just immediately act like you're their pimp when you take them out。

 So so imagine like the coworker thing where they're like kind of nice and then like to you。

 And then like they're they introduce you to girls imagine you take out like cocked wages or strippers。

 You again like even if you don't like strip clubs。

 I get it not everyone like strip clubs even if you don't like strippers。

 I get it if you can just take like two of them even out or three of them。

 And again like the cool thing is when they're not working like they'll pay for all your shit。

 Like they're so independent。 They don't like they seriously。 It's not about the money either。

 That's the coolest part about these strippers。 They make so much money as all cash that they'll just pay for your shit anyway。

 If it's a money thing so go out with them， They'll just like they'll flirt with you ruthlessly because they're so dissent-stice to it right。

 And then all the other girls in the area you have girls just coming up to you be like what the fuck。

 Are you like black and out blood？， Okay， I don't mean that no no when I say belligerent。

 I mean maybe I'll maybe I'll order like a round of shots。

 And then I'll probably like I'm gonna spend more money with the DJ that I want alcohol。

 I'm gonna like make sure Fetty Wat plays non-stop。

 Like I'm gonna have like six seven nine and strap queen just going until people are like what the fuck and then people are gonna go up to the DJ booth。

 This this happens all the time like you want to fuck strippers do this tip of DJ right instead of like tipping you know the stripper hundred bucks。

 I mean tip the DJ you know， 40 50 on the tensile strip club right I mean in Vegas。

 I have them do this in like， I mean they pay me to do it， but you know you place like this。

 I'd probably tip like 40 or 60 if the girl was su I saw super hottie。

 I'd probably tip maybe 80 of the DJ， Um， but then at that of that like then I'd be like my max for my P&L sheet with her like I couldn't I wouldn't be able to。

 Wouldn't be able to go any further than that， So so I would do then right is。

 The the whole point I make sure hey keep six seven I don't just like my fair fetty up song right keep it on right。

 Or like what's that future and Drake one like where they at like keep something like that that like get me into a really good mood。

 Um something a little ghetto， but cool maybe the weekend but the same song over and over。

 And then what and then when people go up to you。 I want you to just point at me and go like this。

 He's like okay fine， So after like three it takes a lot of amount of times for the song to play three four times they go up and they're like。

 What the fuck bro。 He just points at me， I don't know so all these girls are going up to him being like。

 Dude what the fuck are you not gonna play other songs right right？ I want to hear some fucking uh。

 Uh， And then I'm just sitting here being like yeah like this like doing my horrible like white guy rap to the same song and like getting more excited as that comes on and then every girl comes up to me like who are you like what is wrong with you what's happening。

 Right， Yeah， Okay， You do you do like something like that like the spectacle or the uh the whole deal right you do something like that and like like immediate number of clothes。

 All right， The interest is so high after something like that。

 I also don't even tell them why let them let them wonder for months why did DJ did that for you。

 Let it just hang it's so awesome do something crazy like that and then let the like make the girl be like wait what why why why and you just be like。

 Dude I don't every time I fucking come in here。 Yeah， I don't know。 He plays this goddamn song。

 So I mean I it depends dude it depends on the city right so I would okay。

 I hit up everything on industry nights always first because I have to I guess I have to assume that like I'm in your place。

 Right if I'm kind of new this stuff and um let's just say I'm starting fresh in the city。

 I mean I'm gonna suddenly money Tuesday is where I live in the in the clubs like suddenly money Tuesday。

 And I'm gonna make the rounds and I'm gonna and I'm gonna go the same like I'm gonna go three places each night。

 Get what between like three and eight maybe three and ten numbers in each place right um。

 It's all very social numbers， right， So it's so awesome it's it will it blows my mind when guys are surprised when you do the social number close。

 Then like I'll have a guy do a social number close instead of the direct one or instead of being super aggressive。

 Then like 48 hours later home message me be like yo， I just fucked that girl。 How did that happen？。

 I'm like did you bump into again？ He's like yeah， and I go that's how you bump into again。

 Sounds retarded， But seriously you do the social close and then you saran diplomat's bump into a girl again you guys ever have this happen。

 Like you you talk to a girl and then like guess what you bump into her and suddenly what is what happens with the interest level and you did nothing in between。

 Shoes to the roof， How fucking stupid you have to be what cuz oh cuz I happen to be in an area of Scottsdale that like we've both been in before and this the chance of this happening。

 Are very very high， but then now you're gonna look at this like a serendipitous thing。

 What I had that would go to the center on ASU like four years on that scene in the club and then it's just like that like they know me。

 Yeah， these bitches actually like they know you all right cool。
