的群 people are just to meet the other guys that are going to be friends。

 or girls are just interested in meeting as well。， And I think having that diverse kind of breadth of actually。

 the recruits that you're involved in really helps a lot。

 because by doing that you're able to meet all sorts of interesting people。

 who have more things to talk about， have more things to share。

 so that when you meet people that are in these hyperfessional networks。

 you have potential common interests。， Some people will just be interested in surfing。

 so they'll be able to develop some experience，，某些谢崔杰就成为一个，事情和一些数面读  пов有电话，其他人生没订的，主观。

 especially post-ünstled social clubs， that are high in， based upon some common interest。

 when you meet people from these clubs， there is a lot of them， in fact if you Google。

 like high and professional social clubs， in your city， you'll see all sorts of weird clubs。

 building in downtown sե， dark city life， for business professionals。

 and people who have a White Car jobs， but also of any kind of organization。

courter 700，but a lot of people will do this even for business， in fact we even trained people。

 who have real estate companies， where they walked up， and trained people。

at a business convention for real estate，CIO is a multinational companies，for real estate。

and gave him a walkup， and try to close business deals，kind of like a bootcamp under cover。

d now we do all that for other organizations， and we are trying to market our services， in bars，s。

 like the thing is， it's， surprising， When do you do this， how facial network can grow，and the thing。

我相信 most people would know other people，所以 will grow way faster than you think。

 exponentially the average person knows about 200 people， and each of those people know 200 people。

 so the average person probably has one or two degrees of separation， from 40，000 people。

 and I'm sure there's people in that network， that you want to know， people that you could meet。

 and there's so much value， just getting to know almost anyone， because almost anyone。

 who's making friends and socializing， with their network are small。

 we'll know people that you would want to meet， you'll be surprised， because so many people。

 develop their friendships， just based on that， just friendship， not doing on business。

 or for any kind of certain reason， just doing it because they're friends， and a lot of people。

 will actually come to RSD for the same purpose， in fact some people will buy our boot camps with me and Owen。

 so because they want to become our friends， and hang out with us， I had a Middle Eastern Prince。

 he paid for a boot camp with me， and other instructors， so he would go crash at his house。

 and party， and we were mostly party， I mean we kind of taught him some stuff。

 but we were partying with him， and his celebrity friends， like the United Capu。

 and Craig Daniel Craig， and Beyonce at nightclubs， and it was a lot of fun， but at the same time。

 a lot of the RSD benefits are so great， you learn so much， that the people who are working for us。

 volunteering for us， will even pay for the program themselves。

 even if they could get it as an observer for free。

 because they actually want to get that first hand teaching experience， of an instructor。

 hoarding their hand， walking and showing， that world-class experience and those world-class skills。

 I even offer my time， to help out other companies， being an advisor， being an boarded advisor。

 being an aborted directors， I've been doing this though， ever since I was a little kid。

 even when I was like 15 years old， I contacted Hewitt Packard。

 I volunteered to like advertise HP computers， to learn more about their computers。

 and this was the first internet was coming out， and I was showing what the internet was。

 to people who are walking them all， just to get involved with that， and I volunteered at Intel。

 to learn about computer programming， and I volunteered at places in New York， I can run Wall Street。

 to learn about institutional investments and finance。

 I contacted NASA and I said I wanted to learn about， the aerospace program。

 and I thought it'd be really cool to study all these fun things。

 I got involved with the Air Force and also organizations， but I would volunteer my time。

 because you learn， you meet people in these industries， and a lot of people will say。

 especially in Hollywood， hey I want to work in Hollywood， but I won't volunteer there a time。

 to actually network the people， you have organizations that are town agencies。

 like CAA and William Morris， and actually most people will get MBAs。

 and will still volunteer in the mail room， and work there for years。

 to build themselves up and become an agent， and understand the business。

 and that's why most of the people who work for us， had the volunteer for us。

 because we want to see that they're committed， we want to see people that actually。

 are just really interested in our product， as opposed to just working for a company。

 they want to work for a company， they actually truly believe in。

 so I've been doing this ever since I was in the government。

 I think my government job is in the very beginning， whereas surprisingly really valuable。

 even as like a 16 or 17 year old kid， I was my first job as a guy named Senator William Knight。

 and he was teaching me how to do memos and letters。

 and I also worked for the governor's office at the time。

 I was Pete Wilson and I wasn't associated with any， particular political parties。

 so I even volunteered for both the Republican， and Democrat national conventions at the same time。

 and the funny thing is even back then， my biggest interest in going to these events。

 was actually not learning about the politics， but the awesome parties and meeting cool guys。

 and beautiful girls at these events， even from the teenage age。

 I think that finding those exclusive organizations， and volunteering is actually why be created RSD。

 to have three hierarchies of volunteers， we have people who volunteer for just a weekend to help out。

 some of them will even take it to the next level， and they'll be the next tier of VIP hosts。

 they'll even pay and they even volunteer on bootcamp， then we have guys who are interns。

 who will volunteer anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week。

 and they'll work with us potentially on payroll， I think maybe 5% of people who do a。

 still our job or super dedicate actually end up working with this。

 on a very long term and then get full-time jobs， and these are people now who have been everywhere。

 from our video production team， to the RSD instructors that you see on our YouTube channels today。
