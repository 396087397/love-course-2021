看我們，明該，今天，世界一個男人，Don't let you want，That is like a dark cloud hanging over you。

Lot of guys of here have experienced that，It's a major reason why a lot of you guys are here。

It's fixable，You guys will probably fix it even just this weekend。

Not permanently but you know you'll be well on your way，So this is fixable，Bottom line。

Being good with women is fun，Being bad with women sucks， Become good with women，So， Who was I then？。

 Alright， I got my first girlfriend at age 19， She was in a class， she sat beside me。

 That gave me several months to convey my personality to her， It was a three month pickup， Saltook。

 three months， thank you， Now when I got that girl。

 I basically went from 19 years of nothing to having a girlfriend who liked me。

 Coming from that position， Going into college， I was in my last year high school I was going into college。

 I knew that if I left her， At least in my mind it could be another 19 years。

 Until I met another girl， So what did I do？， I brought her with me to college。

 And we moved in together， And while all the other kids in college， We're going out， making friends。

 building social skills， getting experience， I just spent my first year holding up with my girlfriend。

 Sitting inside， And hey， it was pretty fun， It was alright， my neediness， we were both needy。

 We could just hold each other and our little ball of neediness， It was great， But in second year。

 Something happened， She dumped me for the guy who worked at the P2Pid， Yeah， this is true story。

 Okay， And that was hard， For some reason， I was completely deflated by it， It affected me。

 It affected me on a very deep level， I walked around a mess for about six months after this。

 It was rough， Six months I spent just， You know， a radic sleep schedule， Not really focused。

 Now my goal at that point was to go on to graduate school， After I graduated from my undergrad。

 I wanted to go on to be a graduate student in philosophy。

 And because I screwed up my second year of college so badly， The chances of that， You know。

 we're very minimized， It was a downward spiral and eventually I had to dig myself out of this。

 One of the good things that I realized from this， That was actually productive。

 Was that it was a sign that something was missing in me， Something that was deeper。

 It was a sign of a larger shortcoming， That's how I viewed it， And I knew that I had to fix that。

 So the first thing that I did， Was I tried to fix everything in my life to be perfect。

 So I started making more money， I bought a house， I owned a house at 20 years old， I had a new car。

 I had clothes that I liked， I was going to the gym。

 I thought I had everything to get that perfect girl， Do you guys think that worked？， No。

 that didn't work， That didn't work at all， In fact， the few girls that I did meet。

 When I would talk to them about it， I would try to throw that stuff in that I had it。

 And I could never figure out why that little gleam in their eyes， Is sort of extinguished。

 As soon as I would bring any of that stuff up， And they would lose interest immediately。

 I didn't understand that at that point， It just was outside of my reality， I thought， you know。

 you get the stuff， And that's how you become attractive， Now， at this point in my life。

 To have stuff like that， I believe would make me more attractive， However。

 that's because I'm in alignment with it， And that's something that a woman would find out later on。

 After she's found out more about my personality， Ultimately。

 a woman's attracted primarily to your personality， Getting my girlfriend back。

 Probably would have been one of the worst things that could happen to me。

 If she would have come back， I would have just gone back into my old comfort zone， Being a mild rut。

 And nothing would have changed， So by her saying a way。

 that was probably about the best thing that could happen to me， So what did I do about it？。

 The most important thing that I did was make a firm commitment， To get this area of my life handled。

 Now at that point I had no idea how far I could go with this。

 I didn't know that you could develop this into this flashy skill set。

 That people would be impressed by， I just thought， you know， if I went out a lot。

 I could build up my confidence a little bit， I could learn how to chat a little bit better。

 I could become a bit more comfortable with women， Basically what I did was I made a commitment to myself that I would talk to five different women a day。

 This was before I really found any resources about this， I just decided I was going to do it。

 So I would go around my library at school， I was too afraid to go out to night clubs at this point。

 By the way， I was terrified of night clubs， And I could remember just sort of walking around。

 You know， very， very nervous， Probably terrified， actually。

 And I would try and get conversations going， I was actually surprised because girls were pretty friendly。

 I think because I was so nervous， That girls were actually more friendly to me as a result of that。

 And you guys might find that at first too， When you first go out。

 the girls are very friendly to you， As you actually improve a little bit， You know。

 they're not so friendly， And then when you get really good， they become very friendly again。

 You know， I guess because when you're when you're when you're first starting。

 And you just think you're cute， right？， They just think you're kind of dorky。

 And then as you get a bit more confidence， They're like， oh， what's this？。

 But you're not quite cool enough for her to go out with you， And then you just keep working on it。

 Without that firm commitment， I'm sure I would have quit。

 Because the average guy does not want to put themselves。

 In that kind of mindset day after day after day， It's my belief that probably most of you in this room。

 Have one of two personality types， Either you've gotten to a point of so much pain and just you just fed up。

 They're like， you know what？， I'm going to get this fixed， Or you're just a very。

 very open-minded person， And it just sounds funny and you thought you'd check it out。

 But it's usually only one of those two things， Because most guys will not look at this area of their life。

 They refuse to look at it， It's too much of a devaluedation of everything else in their life。

 To actually admit that they could improve in it， People are really kind of like， you know。

 you're just a little bit more， People are very， very uptight about these kind of programs， So。

 From going out for about a year， I built a basic set of social skills， It was alright。

 I even had a couple of successes， But what I found was that whenever I would get a success。

 I would usually lose the girl very quickly， Because I would revert to my old needy。

 clingy behaviors， I think that as you progress in this， It's sort of a natural progression。

 You know， you have successes， And then you'll blow it， But you'll learn from those successes。

 You'll have more successes， you'll blow it， You'll learn from those successes， Anyway， you know。

 that was a bit of a rough time for me， But it forced me to keep on learning， And for four years。

 You know， between 2002 and 2006， I traveled the world， worked on my skills。

 Met anyone who had any shred of skill， Studied and tested anything that was remotely useful。

 I wrote thousands of articles， And I ran workshops every weekend。

 I've been running workshops every weekend for four straight years， Every weekend。

 New students come in， come in rough， You know， work them for about three days。

 They leave nice and shiny and new， Then you get the next batch， come in， You just do it， Bang， bang。

 bang， bang， over and over， Pulls a lot out of you， You need those， you know。

 you need those couple of days to recharge， Get the next guys， pull them in， do the same thing。

 Every weekend， A lot of people speculate， Why I worked so hard at this。

 Did you need women's validation so badly？， What was it？， You know what。

 once I had a girlfriend again， I was alright with it。

 The main reason that I worked at it really hard was just because it was really fun。

 And I just wanted to make his best of products I could， That was really what my goals were。

 And I enjoyed it， so that's why I did it， So who am I now？， I think a lot of people are competitive。

 Who's the best pickup artist that can be for that title， Yeah， you know， I can play that game。

 But for me， having a sense of identity， That's based on something external， Is never a good thing。

 So for me， the way that I like to identify myself， Is as a guy who， you know。

 has stretches potential as far as you can go， A guy who works as hard as he can。

 A guy who tries to get the absolute best out of life， I try to live life to the fullest。

 I just try to have a very， very interesting life， So that's， you know， if I were you guys。

 Rather than trying to be competitive with your skill， trying to compete with other guys。

 I would just worry about being the best that you can be， But， you know。

 just building the best life that you can live life to the fullest， Nowadays。

 having tested everything， Probably ever written on this topic。

 I find that I don't really need much of it anymore， I get approached a couple times a day。

 Even when I'm not dressed well， I can chat with girls， And for some weird reason。

 they want to go out， And it's cool， It's very straightforward。

 A lot of people call that being a natural， I guess I could be called a natural。

 But the difference between me and a natural is， I have a very strong conscious understanding of what it took to get to where I'm at。

 And what kind of mentalities that I have that get me the results that I get。

 And that's really what we're going to discuss today。

 We're going to discuss the structure behind what I'm doing， Yeah， you know。

 my main focus with who I am today， how I identify myself， Is not so much my own results。

 my own results are as good as anyone's， But the transformation that I can aspire to other people。

 I love that， that's really what I pride myself in， That's what I work towards。

 I get some kind of power kick out of it， I love just seeing a guy come in on day one。

 Leaving on day three with that transformation， That's my passion， that's what I'm always working on。

 So， how are most guys？， Well， why don't I ask you guys that？， Any， any。

 you guys want to give me any feedback on how you were before you found this？。

 My initial impression for years was that there's something wrong with me。

 And once I started seeing some of this stuff and， and finally had a realization that it wasn't just me。

 You mean， some of it's me， you know， but， but there's nothing in particular wrong with me。

 It made me see everything a lot differently， And all interactions a lot differently， That's great。

 that's great， where's the other guy？， You know， I could maybe meet a girlfriend once every six months and go out for six months or whatever。

 And then be like crap， you know， I'm missing something， Yeah， and then I discovered， you know。

 I read the game and I saw like， holy shit， Like， there's like a system and you can like systematically study the stuff and become good。

 I'm like， holy shit， let's do this， Yeah， that's cool， anybody else？。

 I know for me just a scared nervous， just on the approach talking to them， interacting with them。

 And then taking it to the next level of， high we've met， now we're talking， I don't know you， but。

 okay， I gotta go to the bathroom， You know， I don't know what happens after that， Gotcha。

 and one more， And I read this earlier before， and it was funny when I was reading this slide。

 I was like， it's almost like you're running about me。

 Because I could identify with every single bullet point on at least two or three of these slides。

 And so this whole process has been a revelation for me to discover the other side to what's really going on。

 But yeah， I used to be like this， absolutely， and there's something that I still am and I can identify。

 But now that I realize that， I can change it， Awesome， that's great， man， All right， okay。

 good stuff， guys， Let's go over some of the mentalities that most guys have coming into this。

 The first， most destructive mentality that most guys have coming into this is what we call scarcity mentality。

 This same mentality is what causes businesses to fight with each other。

 It's what causes guys to get obsessed with one girl， Scarcity mentality。

 it's just a terrible mentality， You don't wanna go there， What scarcity mentality is。

 is when you meet one girl who you like， and you get convinced that either A。

 She's the only girl who's liked you in a while， so if she doesn't like you。

 it could be a long time before some other girl does。

 And you put too much focus on the outcome of it， or B。

 when you think that you couldn't feel that kind of a connection with any other girl，。

 other than that one girl， It's a very common thing， Hollywood movies， the media。

 it's feeding into it， You guys turn on the radio， it's feeding into this mentality constantly。

 it's saturating into your head， And when you meet that girl。

 you're going home and thinking about her， You know what she's thinking about when she goes home？。

 Not you， She's thinking about something other than you， but not you， Okay？， The next one。

 men tend to place women on a pedestal， Do you guys think that women want you to place them on a pedestal？

， No， You have to place them on the pedestal， but when you do that， they disrespect you。

 That's right， yeah， You're down here， they're on the pedestal。

 and you've done exactly what they want， but you've become that much more unattractive by placing them on the pedestal。

 Yeah， yeah， You know， women do not want you to place them on a pedestal， They want。

 well I would imagine， I can only speculate that they probably enjoy being put on a pedestal。

 However， they're not going to be attracted to you if you put them on a pedestal。

 That doesn't mean they want to be disrespected， but they want to be treated as human beings。

 Ultimately， when you're nervous around a woman， you're basically treating her as an object that you're trying to suck value out of。

 And that's why women don't like being put on a pedestal。

 The next mentality that most guys who are unsuccessful with women have is they blame their lack of success on their looks。

 their money， or lack of looks and money， Maybe they're height， something superficial。

 These same guys will see other guys who have the exact same problem as them， having great success。

 They'll see it all the time， but they'll block it out， they'll create blind spots to it。

 because it falls outside of the worldview， and because it would strip them of their excuses。

 It doesn't matter guys， okay？， The next one， a weak sense of reality， and fear of rejection。

 This one， once you get past it， when I talk right now about fear of rejection。

 I can tell you guys stories about how back when I used to stock the library。

 and I had so much fear of rejection， How terrified I was at it， When I tell that story now。

 I feel like I'm telling some kind of inspirational story or something like that that I tell to a bunch of guys。

 I feel like it wasn't true， but it really was true， That's how I felt for years and years。

 Fear of rejection is probably the number one thing the whole guy is back。

 and there is nothing to fear but fear itself， Because if you can lose your fear of rejection。

 girls will like you， Fear of rejection is a self-fulfilling prophecy， If you can get past it。

 you probably won't get rejected， It doesn't mean that your girl is going to have sex with you on the bathroom or something like that。

 But girls will be very friendly to you， they'll be nice to you。

 they'll be attracted to you as a person， and the girls who you really hit it off with。

 you'll want to be dating， So get over your fear of rejection， if you've got an issue with that。

 just get over it， That's obviously what you said and done。

 so that's what we're going to work on today， Men who are failures with women usually make excuses for their natural desires as a man。

 They're embarrassed about the fact that they're attracted to women， If an attractive woman walks by。

 they might look away and wait till she passes by to look at her。

 If their friends ask if they like a girl， they'll say no， even if they do。

 they might hide her from their parents， In a lot of ways。

 society sometimes reinforces that mentality because if a guy likes to grow and she doesn't like him back。

 then they call him a pervert or a weirdo or a stalker。

 He's not a gentleman and they try to pound you with that kind of mentality。

 So obviously a lot of guys might have that kind of fear， it's a natural thing。

 The fact of the matter is this， get comfortable with the fact that you're attracted to women。

 be cool with that， Don't be afraid to admit it， if you see a girl who you're attracted to。

 don't be afraid to look at her， She won't care， she's used to it， she probably likes it， it's fine。

 If you meet a girl you like， go for her phone number， don't pull it back。

 Don't hold it back in any way， in no way shape or form， should you hold that back。

 Even in a relationship， if your girlfriend tries to reel you in and just extinguish your draw towards female energy。

 you should never put up with that， Being a sexual man is part of your identity， it's who you are。

 it's what you're born with， it's what you guys are here for right now， Embrace it。

 become comfortable with it， it's a must， you guys have to do that。

 Most guys who are failures with women， attach far too much meaning onto their interactions with women。

 One girl will give them a little bit of attention。

 and they'll be thinking about it for months after， Maybe they're in their locker， or by a locker。

 and a girl gives them a pen， and they read too much into it， Girl gives them a smile。

 and they read too much into it， One of the reasons why women will be a little bit cold towards a lot of guys。

 is because they know that those guys will read too much into it， they'll psych themselves out。

 and it'll cause more harm than good， So one of the reasons why women act like that is because it's for your own protection。

 is to help you， If a woman can tell that you will not read too much into the interaction。

 that you're cool with it， you're very indifferent to it， you're having fun， you're enjoying it。

 but you're indifferent to it， She will be so much more friendly to you。

 that if she thinks that you're going to read into it， go home and obsess over， or anything of that。

 Of course， someone would like to play mind games， but for the most part。

 the vast majority of women will treat you a lot better if you don't attach too much meaning to the outcome。

 Most guys， here's the next crucial mistake that most guys make。

 is they try to logically convince a woman to feel attraction for them。

 They think that if they can show her that they would buy her presents。

 that they'll take her out to nice places， that they have a nice house， anything like that。

 the guy thinks that the woman will be attracted to that， So in his conversation with women。

 he'll be like， yeah， so I just got this new place and drive there in my new car。

 I could take you out to a really good restaurant， I think a guy。

 one guy told my sister that he's really good at giving oral sex， And he thought that she'd be like。

 wow， okay， That's a logical persuasion， women do not respond to logical persuasion。

 No amount of logical persuasion will make a woman attracted to you。

 except probably the kind of woman that you don't want。

 You will never logically persuade a woman to like you。

 the only way that women will like you is by your vibe。

 The general vibe that you project as a person， how fun you are， how confident， stuff like that。

 we'll get more into that， Most guys that are filled with women try to impress and please people。

 they're people， pleaseers， they're trying to impress people， They radiate neediness and insecurity。

 and they sell themselves too short by making themselves way too available to anyone who will have them。

 So get over that stuff， if you have it， One of the important things about being a mature man is having strong lines that exist in your mind。

 As you mature， you develop a sort of boundaries in your mind about what behavior you'll accept from yourself。

 what behavior you won't accept from yourself， What behavior you accept from other people。

 and what behavior you do not accept from other people。

 A very common thread with guys that are not good with women is they don't have a very well developed line in their minds of what behavior they won't accept from women。

 So a woman might tease them， or like in a way that's kind of not funny， or flake them out for plans。

 stuff like that， And the guy's just okay， okay， and he'll put up with it or even apologize。

 You have to have that line in your mind of what kind of behavior you accept and don't accept。

 and that doesn't mean if you don't accept it， you have to be a dick about it。

 But you do have to have a line in your mind of what you will accept and won't accept。

 A lot of guys that are failures with women believe that they have to be chivalrous and respectful towards women by asking their permission for everything they want to do instead of taking the lead。

 They think that by giving the woman the opportunity to dictate the entire interaction that they're being chivalrous and polite。

 And they are， but what they're also doing is killing the woman's attraction for them。

 When you act in that kind of way， you're killing the woman's attraction for you。

 That doesn't mean that you can't be polite， but it has to be from a position of power。

 The woman wants you to lead， number one rookie mistake， not being able to lead。

 you must be able to lead the interaction， Most guys that are bad with women try to hard to fit in。

 They're afraid to wear anything that might make them not fit in。

 they're afraid to act in ways that would make them not fit in， they're conformist， they're generics。

 A guy who's good with women stands out from that， He sort of bends social custom。

 he makes himself stand out from the other guys， If you guys never learn anything about marketing。

 you learn about making yourself stand out from other products。

 And that's the point here is that you've got to make yourself stand out from the hordes of other men that are coming after her。

 Men that don't know what they're doing with women do not understand female psychology。

 They don't know what attracts them， they're struggling to figure out what attracts them。

 They're probably listening to women's advice， The woman might tell you to be yourself。

 but if you're a needy and insecure guy， then being yourself is not going to work。

 They might tell you to be chivalrous because when you ask her for advice。

 I know how she would want to man a traitor， She pictures like the sexiest guy in the world who she's probably intimidated by。

 And then how that guy could be really super sweet to make her comfortable， Unfortunately。

 if you're not that guy， that approach is probably not going to be very effective， In fact。

 it's probably the exact same approach that is used by every other guy， One of the best， you know。

 funniest things that you can do when you're talking to a girl is to imitate the approaches that every other guy is doing。

 And they will laugh hysterically because they've seen it， You know。

 if their entire life is basically getting the same boring， generic， disney。

 Hollywood type of approach that every other guy is doing， So if any of your approach resembles that。

 just stop， Guys who report with women tend to find themselves in the friendship zone。

 They think that if they can stay friends with the woman long enough that eventually she'll come to see the light。

 She will eventually， you know， if they listen to the girl's problems with her other boyfriends。

 that eventually she'll realize， You don't want that jerk。

 you want me because I won't treat you like that， So the girl will go on and on about the problems that she's having with her boyfriend and he'll say。

 oh god， I think that's terrible， A man should never treat a woman like that， And meanwhile。

 he's thinking himself further and further into the friendship zone， The girl。

 the poor girl thinks that she's got a friend who she could confide in， And meanwhile， you know。

 you know， the guy just jumps out of the closet randomly one day and says， I like you。

 I want to be a man for you， just， whoa， you're not my girlfriend， I thought you were my girlfriend。

 Most guys think that by being the girl's girlfriend that they can get her， We call that an orbiter。

 you guys ever heard of orbiter's？， And it's like a planet and they orbit around the planet like that。

 That's what most guys think we'll get them girls， It doesn't work。

 they wind up doing that for their whole lives， If you're doing that， just stop， okay？

 If you want to be friends with the girl， do it because you want to be friends with the girl。

 But don't do it if it's because you want something more and you're not satisfied with that relationship。

 So the first shift in thinking， okay， to get good with women requires shifts in your thinking。

 The very first shift in thinking is that believe it or not。

 money and looks are not emotional entities to the woman， Money and looks are constructs of society。

 We could go into a sort of a philosophical argument about this。

 about different standards of looks and different societies all over the world and whatnot。

 But for the most part， the thing with looks， money， mostly constructs of society。

 you don't need them， I've seen thousands of guys have tremendous success。

 Why don't I tell you some stories？， I've seen guys come on workshop that are 5 feet tall。

 50 years old， making out with 5'10"， 19 year old girls。

 I remember a reporter who came on our program that was about 60。

 He just did exactly what he was supposed to do， He got like a 22 year old girlfriend out of it。

 the exact same thing works for all guys， When you've grown up in society that's told you that you need certain things to be attracted to women。

 And you don't have those things， and the result you don't have a woman。

 You're going to want to hang onto your excuses， You're going to want to say to yourself， you know。

 you've got your story， you're addicted to your story of why you can't get a woman。

 And you'll never want to stop and think about your own shortcomings that you have to overcome。

 But the truth is， whoever has whatever shortcomings that you have。

 anybody who has that can become good with women， anybody， This is not up for debate， it's proven。

 we've got countless instances of it， it's been proven over and over and over。

 Anyone who's a skeptic can be turned around in one night， it's possible， you can do it。

 but it does take time， You will have to put time in。

 Wouldn't you say there's a certain level of confidence that can come from having a certain level of success in a career and money。

 And that confidence will then draw women into you in that sense， Well see， that's exactly it。

 what happens is say that a guy is born with what society considers good looks， Or money。

 or whatever else society bestows on him as being good， He goes out into the world。

 he looks at these other guys that have that and they're getting women and he says， oh damn。

 look at that， I'm like that， I deserve to get women， He's confident， he feels confident to approach。

 he feels confident to act in an alpha male kind of way， Women are attracted to that。

 and then we see that and we say， hey look， all the good looking guys have women。

 That must be what it is， but we're not looking beneath the surface。

 We're looking at the superficial stuff and we're making our deductions based on that when it's really not the case。

 So yes， I definitely think that those things can give you confidence and they can help you。

 Your life is certainly a lot easier at 6 feet tall and rich and good looking than it is at 4'5"。

 you know， chubby and you know， 80 years old， Right？， But let me tell you something， you go get me。

 go get me that 80 year old guy， bring him out with me， We'll go into， we'll go anywhere you want。

 just let us work man， let us work and you'll see what happens。

 You will see it and it will blow your mind because it still blows my mind every time I see it， Okay？

 I look at， I'm like wow， okay， but it could be done， Again， it's just， it's mortiser mount。

 You know， in my opinion， the number one reason why older guys have a trickier time with this is not because of the excuses that they would come up with。

 But because they're so ingrained into their behaviors for so many years that they will。

 they just simply refuse to let them go， A guy who's lived 70 years with not a lot of success will have a million of one rationalizations for why he couldn't have success。

 And he is not going to want to let that go， he is not going to want to discredit all that and remove all that meaning from his life。

 But a major， major part of this entire process is being willing to let go of your identity。

 being willing to let go of your beliefs and just scrap them。

 And start over and build something better and stronger， So that's really what this is about。

 so I mean to me that's the number one challenge that older guys have is really just being able to unwire the mistakes。

 And you know， add the new stuff in， but if they're willing to do it and some guys are。

 they get the success， Simple as that， Alright， what women respond to is not logical persuasion but emotions。

 To attract women， you must have the kind of personality that they respond to emotionally。

 What I've listed here， confidence， humor， social skills， dominance， charisma， being different。

 standing out， being unpredictable， These are the things that are going to attract women to you。

 not your bank account， not your looks， those things can help you， But you know what。

 ultimately those are for your happiness， Things like， you know， looks， money。

 anything superficial is about your happiness， it's really not about the woman's happiness。

 One of the RSD guys， I remember he got， you know， when he first came on board。

 he didn't have a lot of money and he was really good with women。

 And he started dating this girl who was about 33， gorgeous 33 year old girl。

 he just really liked her， he was about 21， And you know。

 I remember finding out that that girl used to live with her husband， was a millionaire before that。

 And she， you know， walked away from that， just to go live with this guy who was more fun and gave her more emotions。

 The emotions that you give the woman is what she's drawn to， the experience that you give her。

 In a lot of ways， you know， for a woman to go with a guy who doesn't have all that stuff but who makes her feel amazing。

 is a more powerful experience for her， it's more meaningful。

 There's a million of one reasons why this stuff doesn't matter， you know， I could give you guys。

 I could spend the entire day giving you example after example after example， You know what。

 ultimately you can choose to believe or you can choose not to believe it。

 but until you've gone out and tested it and put your time in， you're not going to know。

 You've got to go out and put your time in and find out for yourself， as you should with anything。

 Next shift in thinking， you can learn to become good with women。

 just like you can learn to become good with any other skill。

 How many guys in this room have learned to play a sport， put up your hand？， Good。

 how many guys in this room have learned to play some kind of musical instrument， put up your hand？。

 Good， alright， so everyone in this room can learn to become good with women， How many years， yay！。

 That's awesome， how long do you guys think it takes to get good at a sport？， Just yelled out。

 yelled out loud for some of the microphones can hear you， Five years， okay。

 how about a musical instrument， yelled out？， Five years， three months， okay。

 well maybe you'll be a prodigy， You know what， learning to get good with women is a pretty similar learning curve。

 If you've ever done a new sport， you might get to the gym where the people who are experienced are playing and you walk in。

 And you feel almost alienated from it because you look at it and you couldn't picture yourself doing that。

 You know， you stick to it， you tough it out， you keep sticking， you stick at it and a month later。

 You actually see those other guys coming in for their first time and you go， oh。

 I used to look like that， You know， six months in， you're actually not incompetent， A year in。

 you're actually pretty good， three years in， you're awesome， you're as good as anybody else， To say。

 oh， it takes a couple of years to get good with women will hold up。

 It's not like you're not making progress during this entire time， you're constantly making progress。

 that's why it's fun， One weekend is enough to get some major。

 major progress and if you keep that progress going， your progress just goes exponentially。

 I truly believe the reason why we don't have more cases of guys that are just awesome with women is because they don't stick to it。

 They might get a girlfriend saying they're out of there， they go back to their life， whatever it is。

 To get good with women， you have to approach and interact with women constantly。

 you have to make that decision， What I did was I made a decision to take a couple of years of my life to get it worked out。

 I took about， you know， probably three， four years of my life， focused a couple hours a day on it。

 and I got it， That's what I did， and it was fun， I enjoyed every minute of it。

 A lot of people think that that's a little bit intense。

 they think you can detract from the other aspects of your life， Well， that depends if you let it。

 if you decide to let it detract from other areas of your life， then that's what you do。

 But you don't have to， on the other hand， letting it detract from other areas of your life for a short period of time can be worth it。

 The world is your pickup lab， that's a great frame， the world is your pickup experiment lab。

 You are an experimenter， a social scientist， you're just messing around in a lighthearted social experiment to find out what's going to happen。

 Another great frame， this is like an old school frame that anybody who got good at anything probably has。

 All rejection or failure is feedback， this goes way back to any field that you look at。

 All rejection is feedback， any time that you approach a woman and you quote unquote get rejected。

 which most times you don't even get rejected， it just doesn't go anywhere。

 Or she's busy or whatever， That is feedback， because if you would have approached differently。

 you would have gotten a different result， So you have to view it that way。

 every approach that you do is feedback for you to improve your social skills。

 If you go out three nights a week for a year and you get that much feedback。

 you're going to make those little calibrations until your skills are far。

 far improved from a year ago， Okay， the next one that a lot of guys really goof up。

 take nothing personally guys， don't take anything personally， Let me give you an example。

 I remember being in Toronto and social experimenter that I am。

 I decided to pull a girl's hat down on her eyes like that， And she didn't like that at all。

 she got very upset， This is kind of a bit more advanced concepts。

 but one of the things that you'll learn is， see I was a bit out of state when I did that。

 I was actually my first approach of the night， and I wasn't congruent with it。

 if I would have done that later in the night and I was just on and having fun。

 she would have viewed it as fun， Because I didn't earlier than I think， probably was pretty creepy。

 Anyway， I remember about maybe a month or two months， I can't really remember， a little while later。

 I was in a different club， And I was kissing this girl， she's on my lap， and I'm kissing her。

 we're having a great time， And I kept looking at her， and I'm like， I know this girl。

 I recognize this girl， Now I think it's never a good idea to say to a girl。

 do I know you from somewhere？， Because it shows that the time that you met it meant too much to you。

 like I was too important to you， But it was driving me insane， so I was like。

 do I know you from somewhere？ Where do I know you from？， And she didn't know。

 of course she had no idea， And eventually I realized that was the girl that had told me to fuck off and to go away about a couple months earlier for pulling her hat down。

 So you guys can see how， take nothing personally， When she told me to go away。

 it wasn't a rejection of me， it was a rejection of my approach， She didn't know me。

 when you approach her， don't she rejects you， she doesn't know you。

 It's like taking basketball shots， you're just taking basketball shots， that's like surfing a wave。

 trying to surf a wave in， That's all that this is， you take your basketball shot。

 you went a bit to the right， you goofed up， You go approach your girl。

 if you're not feeling your confidence， if your eye contact isn't good， if your voice is weak。

 if you're submissive， you're uninteresting， You know， you're not going to get the girls attention。

 she's not going to be that nice to you， If you're a cool guy， you come in like that。

 she will be nice to you， So don't take anything personally， nothing is personal。

 take it all as feedback， it's feedback of things that you can change your work on。

 Here's another ultimate frame that a lot of guys who are successful in any kind of business or anything like that have。

 including getting good women， Focus on the process， not the outcome， be process oriented。

 not outcome oriented， What that means is that you're going after the skill。

 not necessarily the girl， When you're talking to the women， when you go out。

 you're talking to girls， you're trying to improve your social skills。

 You're trying to become a better person， you're trying to become a better communicator。

 You're not chasing that one girl going home， getting a crush on her， becoming obsessed with it。

 Go after the skill， now of course， that can also backfire on you if you hold onto that for too long。

 Because what some guys will do is they'll hold onto the， I'm going after the skill。

 not the girl for too long， And they'll be girls that like them and they'll bail out when a girl really likes them and wants them to keep going。

 Because they say， I'm going after the skill， So there comes a certain point where yes。

 you have to go after the girl guys， When you see yourself reaching a point where you're at that level where you're seeing。

 you know that you should be going for， But for now， just focus on building the skill， that's it。

 Have you guys ever heard of progressive desensitization？， Progressive desensitization is。

 it's just psych jargon， It basically means you progressively desensitize yourself to something that makes you a little bit nervous。

 You just get a little bit more comfortable with it， a little bit more comfortable with it。

 and eventually you become very comfortable with it。

 If you guys want to get a rough idea of how this works。

 the basic way that learning to get good with women works is that you keep going out。

 Until you're so desensitized to it that you're confident。

 And what's the number one thing that women say they want to mend？。

 So the way that the process works is basically you go out， you desensitize yourself。

 and then you just become this confident guy， And now all of a sudden you have all these options。

 that's how it works， Small chunk， everything that you learn。

 You guys are going to get 10-11 hours of seminar， You guys think you're going to be able to remember all that？

， There's no way you guys are going to be able to remember all that。

 You'll have to look at your notes， small chunk it in， piece by piece， over a couple of months。

 That's how you'll get it down， What a lot of guys have is called the fallacy of the perfect approach。

 The fallacy of the perfect approach is where what a guy will do is he will read and read and read and read and read and read。

 Watch videos and look at it and look at it and look at it thinking that if he can create the perfect approach。

 Then he can go out one time， you know， one shot， one kill， get the girl， and he's done。

 He never has to approach another woman again in his life， because he get married。

 You have the perfect approach， it's not going to work like that。

 There is not a case in history that work like that， it will not work， You have to take your lumps。

 it's not that bad， it's actually pretty funny realistically， It's fun， you've got to get out there。

 you will not build the perfect approach， so just get out there， In fact。

 if you're watching this at home， you've probably already got enough information to go out there。

 Just get out there， stop reading， stop watching， let's go， Okay， guys are， okay。

 so what you guys have got to do is you've got to seriously get out there， just put the books down。

 You know， products like this is something to give you reference for outside， Right。

 for outside of that time that you're spending practicing。

 but ultimately the real learning is done in nightclubs， malls， social gatherings。

 That's where you're going to learn， you're going to learn more and half an hour of going out。

 Then you're going to learn in 10 hours of theory， so you must go out， Small chunk it in。

 you'll build it， Here's the next shift in thinking， Women who have sex with you are not all sluts。

 So what do I mean by that？， One of the things that a lot of guys that come to this have a hard time moving past is。

 This is kind of a rough area for some guys， The best way to get a girlfriend， believe it or not。

 is to have sex with her， If you like a girl， you want to have sex as quickly as possible。

 That doesn't mean to be pushy， because if you push a girl， it's not good， we'll go against you。

 But the point is this， a lot of guys have the belief that they need to take a girl on X number of dates。

 They need to show the girl certain assets that they have or whatnot。

 This is not an effective approach， The way that it works with women is this。

 A woman wants to see who you are， she wants to see your personality。

 Then she wants to see if you're congruent to that， She's going to want to find out if you're that。

 if you're really that guy who you're projecting yourself to be， That confident， cool guy。

 she's going to want to see if there's any holes， So she's going to do a little tests on you。

 She might mess with you a little bit， she might not even do this consciously， it's unconscious。

 But as soon as that woman is satisfied that you're the guy who you claim to be。

 This is something that she wants to do， and this is something that she feels good about， Boom。

 she's ready， that's it， And that doesn't require X number of dates。

 that's not a point of prolonging things longer and longer， It's just you convey your personality。

 It has to be a situation that she feels good about， And if that's the case， it's going to happen。

 If you want to get a girlfriend， go through that process， That's how you'll get the girl。

 Women want a man who knows who he wants and knows how to get it， She's not， most likely。

 not going to help you， She's not going to pick herself up for you。

 She wants you to figure it out for yourself， Because if you can't figure that out for yourself。

 what does that say about you？， What does that say about the kids that she would have with you？。

 You must be able to figure it out for yourself， A lot of guys think that if they have sex with a girl quickly。

 it could， it could wreck the possibility of a future relationship， In reality。

 if you slip with a girl and she doesn't like you after that， that's a very different issue。

 It's a very different issue， that has to do with your personality afterwards。

 You know how you were in bed？， It's not because you had sex， that's not why。

 So you want to create a situation where this is something that happens quickly。

 Sex is not something that takes months or years， Sex is， look， most girls。

 the reason why they'll be uptight about sex is because men judge them for it。

 Women are not typically， typically anyway， Because I'm making a lot of generalizations here， I mean。

 typically women are not the ones who are uptight about sex。

 Men are the ones who are uptight about sex， men judge women for it， So women will play that role。

 If a woman doesn't feel like she's going to be judged for it， then she'll go with the flow。

 Sex is not a big deal， One of the big realizations that a lot of guys have is that they could meet a woman and be having sex with her a few hours later。

 It's not always the case， But the women who， you know， men will try to categorize girls。

 They'll say， well， if she did that， then she's not a girl from material， Well， that's ridiculous。

 That's not true at all， A lot of girls who have never had sex with a guy before six months。

 If they meet the right guy， she'll decide， bang， she chooses， She says， I choose this guy。

 And she knows that she's ready because she knows that he's the guy who he projects himself to be。

 And this is something I'm going to feel really good about。

 So this is something that happens quickly， It's not a long process。

 If you've gone out with a girl more than three times and you haven't had sex。

 probably you're not ever going to have sex， That's the most likely the case。

 And I'm sure a lot of women will say that's not true or they'll think otherwise。

 But that's personally my experience， This is not a big deal。

 Take it out of your mind that sex is a big deal， A lot of people are having sex。

 get comfortable with it， Don't be uptight about sex， be comfortable with your sexuality。

 You'll reap the rewards from it， The question on that。

 in terms of if she's gone out with you three times。

 would you say that she definitely has an interest in you in that sense？， I mean。

 she's going to move from。。。， She's not going to go on the third day with you if she's not interested。

 Is there a special girl on your mind right now？， Oh yeah， totally， Yeah， no， is there？， Yeah。

 And you've been out a few times and。。。， Yeah， we're not about three times。

 she's interested in going on the fourth one， And just like。。。， Any kids？， No， No！， Really？。

 How long。。。， Do you think that you could have kissed her within the first hour of meeting her？。

 Yeah， you could， Let me tell you， I can tell you， I don't know if she would have kissed me back。

 Okay， I'll sort of move it， move ahead briefly， a little fast forward。

 Then we'll kind of jump back here， Okay， let me ask you a first question。

 Where did you meet this girl？， In a bar， In a bar， okay， So you approached？， Yes。

 You approached her， okay， Did you have touch going early on？， Yes， Okay， Sugar hand right away。

 Sugar hand？， Yeah， Okay， that's not bad， Was she touching you a lot？， No。

 but she came back to the apartment with us， Okay， that's good， that's good， Her and her friends。

 So it sounds like you。。。， Wow， okay， And then she said， oh my god， And then she said， oh my gosh。

 guys never ask me out， I'm like， hey， I want to go out， Got her phone number， great， we went out。

 Okay， so here， let's dig into that more， So。。。， How close was your face to her？， To her face？。

 What are you talking？， When normally we talk？， No， no， no， when you were in the bar， Like。

 this close， this close， like。。。， Pretty close， because it was。。。。

 Pretty close because it was in the bar？， Yeah， Okay， were you whispering in a ear at all？， No， Okay。

 When you talk to a girl， there's certain boundaries， that are getting set early on， Okay。

 so say that you would have。。。， Say that you would have immediately。

 created that kind of interaction， Okay， say that I've known you a long time， And we've always。。。。

 Okay， okay， so say。。。， Okay， so say that I've known you for a long time。

 And we've always kind of been like this， And then all of a sudden I。。。， Hey， what's up， buddy？。

 You can't like that？， Okay， that's weird， right？， Yeah， But。。。， You're immediately like that？。

 What if you were always。。。， Yeah， what if that was always a comfort zone？。

 That doesn't mean to be the grope guy， or the close talker sign-filled guy， right？。

 But what I'm saying is that， these are things that you could have gotten around。。

 So what's happened is you've established a dynamic， in your relationship。

 where there are certain boundaries that are there， And so what's happening is it sounds to me like。

 you guys do like each other， but you've gotten into what's called a dating frame。

 So what's happened is that because you're in a dating frame， and you'll see this in movies。

 where in movies， the girl will be ready to sleep with a guy。

 and then she'll realize she's in love with them， and she goes， no， I love you， I have to wait。

 So she's going to treat you differently， because you're in a dating frame。

 then if you would have been in a very different frame， which is what we'll discuss。

 and in which case you could have shifted into a dating frame， very smoothly right after， okay？。

 So there's still hope， okay？， So we'll go through that some more， okay？。

 We'll talk a little bit more about that。， But yes， there would have been ways，。

 there's a lot of probably different things that you could have done， to be a lot more successful。

。
