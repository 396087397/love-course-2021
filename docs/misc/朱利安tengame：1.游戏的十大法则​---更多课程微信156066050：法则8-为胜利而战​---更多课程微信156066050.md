killed to win，this is big where，if you think about it， it's like you're going up。

 you're offering an abundance of fun， and the way an interaction naturally progresses。

 is it just expands，most guys try to stop that expansion。

 they're too scared of going all the way to say sex， because that's how it goes。

 it's like we're having fun， how can we have more fun， how can we have more fun。

 at some point it's sex， and guys are too scared， they hold it back，and the girls like fuck this。

 it kills the interaction，you always have to be playing to win，ok，don't try to leave on a high note。

don't try to hold back， it's like go with the flow of it。

and think about what outcome or climax you're going for，there's three outcomes basically，ok。

 and this is how it works，and you're playing to win， you're always thinking。

you're either going to pull her，that's Plane，which is what you're trying to do。

but not all girls will be down，if they're not down， what do most guys do？。

 they either interpret it as a rejection or they go for the phone number。

and what do they miss out on， fucking plan B， which is go with her。

 be willing to change courses of action， just go with her。

 a lot of being relatable to is changing courses of action not getting your ego involved。

 but basically， plan B， that's like 50% of your fucking results。

 50% of the girls you will sleep with， you're going to go with them， if you just try to pull。

 as we talked about， that's not you're leaving a lot on the fucking table， ok。

 in reality the way it works is， you're probably going to pull 30% of the girls。

 you're going to go with 70%， however， you will fuck。

 more of the girls you pull than the girls you go with， so in the end it evens out to a 50-50。

 you know， but， pulling is just 30%， you can bring her to your bed or you can go with her to her bed。

 every girl at the end of the night is going into， a bed。

 find a way to go in there with her or to be there when she gets in bed。

 and if that fails only then you go for the phone number， but don't miss this step here。

 and you better be thinking like this is where the interaction should go， it's not just。

 let's just keep talking， let's just keep talking， you probably realize this。

 you miss the window sometimes where it expands， you get rejected。

 I remember that happened to me the first time I ever kissed a girl off cold， approach。

 I would talk to these girls and I got past， you know approach anxiety and start hooking them。

 and then I'd get into these long sets where we got really serious talking， there's ever have those。

 you just sit down， you're really into it， and then at some point you're like fuck I should kiss her。

 she expects it to， and then you're too scared， and you keep talking， you keep talking。

 when it dies down and you're done， okay， because she's like， oh we're expanding， we're expanding。

 oh he's a fagging out done， you know， the same will happen with pulling if you don't keep building it to sex。

 suddenly you're taking away from the fun， something to keep in mind， okay。

 so you have to play to win and you have to start thinking about what's the win。

 and it's not getting the girl to， getting everyone to like you as we talked about before it's taking things to the。

 climax whatever that climax is， yes， you and the new， yeah， exactly what I said here。

 don't accelerate it， but realize that it's more unfair to take away from that win。

 like that wins a win for both of you， that's why she gets rejected if you miss the window you get away from that。

 giving to taking， you take away from the fun， you're not providing value anymore。

 there's a thing that's important since basically， 95% of you are going to put a gold medal in the Olympics for example。

 not to eat to lose， but the other 5% have win and only enjoy winning， is that also quite a game？。

 yeah but again it's like， the win overall is that feeling of giving， that's the win。

 you focus on that it'll naturally lead towards sex。

 don't think it just sex is the win otherwise you'll hate the interaction。
