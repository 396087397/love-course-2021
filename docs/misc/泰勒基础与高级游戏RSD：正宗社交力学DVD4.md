 sometimes when you do an open，， it's almost like an airplane in a rough landing。

 like you know you land like，， like that， because you're trying to stabilize that conversation。

 so sometimes you might open the conversation， and the girls are just，， you know， kind of uncool。

 they're just sort of，， it just doesn't work out so well， sometimes the girls will lock up。

 when a girl locks up what that means is you can see her just kind of freeze up。

 you can see she's not comfortable， you can observe that， you start talking， you know。

 you start the conversation， kind of，， just kind of locks up， she's become uncomfortable。

 if I see that， oftentimes I will， back off a bit， okay， I'll actually do that。

 like if I see the girls like，， like that because I screwed up。

 so I just do something I'm not just back so whatever it was， I'll just，， as I keep talking。

 just give it a little bit of space， you approach in， if you see that the girl。

 is not comfortable with your presence， it's almost like， you know， like a cat， right。

 just back off a bit， as you keep talking， then say something funny， now you're back in。

 whenever you say something funny， you can sort of escalate a little bit。

 because as long as she's laughing， it's okay， you guys will find that， you guys will。

 you'll learn to calibrate that when you're out， you'll pick the stuff up nationally。

 then you'll probably hear this later， and then you'll go，， oh yeah， that makes sense。

 what you'll find is that， whenever they're laughing， you can just do just about anything。

 but if they're not laughing， and you do something that， you know，。

 makes them uncomfortable they kind of lock up， so that's what you'll find。

 the problem with that of course is you can sometimes get into a rut。

 where you're always trying to keep them laughing， you turn into dancing monkey man。

 so you gotta be careful of that too， it has to become just sort of a part of your personality。

 to break out the humor， just a part of who you are。

 here's another tough one that guys get caught up in。

 a lot of the time they'll open the conversation， and they might be somewhere， that's very。

 trafficked， so say that you stop a girl， and a place where there's a lot of traffic going by。

 people traffic， what's happening in your conversation， you're both getting bumped around。

 it's going like that， is that， can you work in that environment？， you can't work in that。

 it's ridiculous， you can open in that， hook quickly， you know。

 make yourself stand out from other guys quickly， some kind of humor， whatever it is。

 we'll get to that， hook quickly， then you gotta quickly move， or somewhere that you can work。

 a great place， just a wall， just leaning against the wall， like that。

 both of you are leaning against the wall， great， it's out of the way， a chair both seated， great。

 even somewhere that you're both standing， but that's clear， so you're not getting bumped around。

 that's great too， but ultimately you have to be able to work， so how do you do that？。

 remember we talked about， crossing that point where she wants you to stay。

 you open the conversation， this is something funny or quirky quickly， she's into it say。

 you know what？， here come on， like that， notice how I just did that by the way， I didn't say。

 would you like to stand over there， I'm not likely to say that， it's almost like hypnotism。

 it's just like a command， like that， like that， that's how you do it。

 that's how you always want to lead a situation， just like an air traffic controller， like that。

 that's how you want to do it， just like that， that's it， simple， don't ask for permission， lead。

 lead， you are supposed to be leading， from open to close， always leading。

 sometimes a girl will chase you， great， but anytime that's not the case， you must be leading。

 get somewhere that you can work， that's the only way， that you're ever going to get anywhere。

 otherwise it's just， you know just another approach， learning experience， but ultimately。

 waste your time， now how about， when you're talking to， a girl and her friend comes。

 we discussed this earlier， what happens when you're talking to a girl， and her friend comes。

 you're not leading， what's that， you're not leading， she's like， engaged somewhere else。

 and you're kind of standing there， well that's true， but all， like if you think about it。

 she has to talk to her friend， she has to talk to her friend， when you're talking to a girl。

 you sit in there talking to her， and her friends come in， what she's going to do， most likely。

 she's going to go， ah， super hug， all emotional， and then you're， you're just sitting there。

 what's happening to your value， what's happening to your status， if you're just sitting there。

 while she talks to her friend， it's going down， okay， so， generally， if I'm talking to a girl。

 if I see out of my， sort of peripheral vision， there's some other girl， with like a super big smile。

 like this， kind of walking at her， okay， the first thing that I'm going to do， is immediately。

 I'm going to turn off that girl， and I'm going to pull her in， to that conversation quickly， okay。

 so I'm going to do that immediately， so for you know， I talked about the， the Damon Bowie thing。

 right， you know， cheap little， quick conversation， starter， the fact that it sucks。

 is what's good about it， if your conversation starter is too good， it sounds rehearsing， can't。

 if it's just kind of loose， just whatever， it's just a conversation， it's great， so my。

 like my preference in any， like opening line， or any kind of line， my preference behind lines。

 actually that is not that good， because then it's normal， so say that you have a situation， where。

 you know， the girls coming in， you can see that， immediately， pull her in。

 start that conversation with her， get her engaged quickly， now you've got them both here， so now。

 now it's fantastic， you've got that situation， that you want where you're engaged in them both。

 so they're not going to start hugging each other， and jumping around， we're off the dance floor。

 and they're out of there， and you're just， okay， next right， so you want to avoid that。

 now if she does go， and start hugging her friend， you still want to try and get in there quickly。

 or you want to turn around， and talk to somebody else， um， you know， I got to reiterate again。

 a lot of these sort of moves， and counter moves， and whatnot。

 can get you in a very reactive mindset， because you always feel like。

 you need to be doing something， it's not that you need to do this stuff。

 I'm sure I've had plenty of successes， when I didn't do this stuff， but understand that。

 most of the time， when you're standing there， it is a sign that you're wanting something。

 and it can come across the wrong way， so hey， if you're really didn't affect you。

 and it didn't really affect you， in any way that she went and talked to her friend。

 and you just want to stand there， you can do that， and if she， and if she senses that， that's fine。

 but if she feels， if she gets the impression， by you just standing there waiting。

 that you have somehow lowered yourself， and she has that impression， you have to use your own。

 judgment at your own social intelligence， to decide that， but if she has that impression。

 it's not good， so that's what I'm talking about right there， now say that you have。

 an interrupted approach， or a loss approach， an example of that would be like。

 say that a fight breaks out， say that， you know， someone throws up， you know。

 these kind of silly things can happen， say that， the traffic just pushes you apart。

 try to follow me here， say that you're having the conversation， it pushes you apart。

 and then you walk right back up to a reinitiate， on the same conversational thread。

 this is kind of interesting， what that， this is kind of trippy。

 what that's going to communicate to her， is that you want that conversation very badly。

 and that while you were separated， for like you know， thirty seconds or whatever， you were like。

 I want to get my point out， and then you went back up to her。

 because you want to get that point out， so she's going to feel that， especially if it's true。

 that's what you want it， so generally， if we get split up， if I'm doing an approach。

 if I open and then we get split apart， I'm not going to go back in with that exact same thing。

 I'll probably just go in and talk about something else， another thing that I'll do a lot of time。

 is I'll do playful stuff， like， I'll reengage with， I hate you， or you and I would not get along。

 those are two that I'll often reengage with， if you reengage with， I hate you。

 bear in mind this is playful， if I'm scary， depends on how you do it， when you reengage， I hate you。

 why？， because girls cannot take that， they want everyone to love them。

 so as soon as you say that they're curious， what's going to say I hate you， you say， you know my。

 my little sister has the exact same shoes as those， and I had to shop with her for like three hours。

 did you get the last pair？， you got the last pair didn't you？， and I mean， no I didn't。

 which doesn't make sense because she doesn't know that， I said no I didn't， and then。

 now you're reengaged， okay？ the point is reengaged with something。

 kind of off of what it was previously， it's just a good general rule of thumb， also you know again。

 find out what works for you， this is stuff that works really well for me。

 find out what works for you， if it doesn't work for you， don't use it。

 don't feel the need to use anything， that doesn't work for you if you've tested it。

 now within the group， you want to know what the relationship is， you want to know what's going on。

 so at some point you probably want to say， how did you guys meet？， how did you guys meet each other？

， you can find that out quickly， if you're talking to a guy and a girl， that could be her brother。

 you don't know that， you have no idea， so you want to find out quickly。

 now how about getting a low in time with the girl？， on an approach， you could have。

 say that you had a group of six people， if you talk to your girl， and there's a group of six people。

 they're going to be usually fine with that， they're okay with that， they're cool with it， why？。

 because they've got five people to keep their conversation going。

 how about if you just approach two girls， and you just talk to the one girl。

 that's a different situation， if you approach two girls。

 and you just hog all the attention to the one girl， the other friend is going to get bored。

 frustrated， and probably want to get out of there， how do you handle that？， talk to both girls。

 talk to them both equally， tease the one who you like， so you have more sexual tension going on。

 they're more of a plot line， you can ask for a play from there， that's great。

 it just depends on the situation， I'm not a big fan of holding the entire group's attention。

 I find that a lot of work myself， but if that's going to make the difference。

 between them pulling the girl away or not， then I'll do it， so that's how I'm always gauging it。

 I'm kind of like， I'm kind of a mix， if I see that， if I see that I need to hold that whole group。

 I'll do it， but if I don't need to， I'm minimizing it as quickly as possible。

 because I'm going to get that same attraction， just by talking to that girl。

 so you guys always have to be managing that， if you're seeing that this group。

 is going to cause you a problem， that the friends are going to cause a problem。

 you want to talk to them， joke with them， shoot the shit with them。

 and then that girl is going to be seeing you doing that。

 she's going to find out more about you while you're doing that， on the other hand。

 a lot of guys get too focused on that， and they wind up working this whole group。

 while the girls are sitting there， they can be talking to her。

 and they can be building that connection with her， and it's a complete waste of time。

 so you want to basically look at， the sort of different philosophies， of how to handle that。

 and calibrate to the situation， don't be confined by rules， never let a rule confine you。

 learn from the rule， benefit from it， but don't let it confine your behavior。

 I get a lot of situations， where you're walking into a group， that has a lot of guys。

 a lot of girls， so opening in with a girl， usually gets a fuzzy response。

 how do you open when you're， when you're a fuzzy response， you'd get other guys。

 trying to be protective right away， or she'd feel uncomfortable。

 you could tell she's feeling uncomfortable， that she's being the only one， sort of， you know。

 it's obvious that you're trying to pull her away， from the group， and that's the tension。

 that's immediately， when that comes down to， you have to look at the situation。

 and play it accordingly， if I don't like those guys， I might just clown them， you see。

 you don't have， there's no need to， befriend them， you don't have to， but why not befriend them。

 they could be cool， maybe they could be friends of yours， eventually， you see them saying。

 so you just go， look， if I like， if I want to， I'm not the kind of guy。

 to sit there talking to someone， I don't want to talk to you， I'm not going to sit there。

 and indulge some guy， I don't like， if I'm just not interested， especially in clubs， when you guys。

 when you guys are in bad， side of their personality， so for me， it's about like。

 I just do what I feel， you know， if I see that， if I see， I just use my social， intelligence。

 if the， if the situation is such， that， it would be just a better vibe， for everyone。

 if we all just got to know each other， we'll do that， if the guys just being， a dick。

 I'll play that too， that's great， that is fine， and I'll play that， so I'll go with， you know。

 I just go with the flow， you know what I mean， I just do， I mean my philosophy， is do what you。

 feel and you come from， a position of realness， you'll get a great result， that's always how。

 you're going to get your best result， because this is going to be， a lot more power， behind that。

 than like a chest move， approaching girls， the bar， that's the 21， say that you've got two girls。

 set up against the bar， they're back like that， the way that I'll approach， those two girls。

 I'll go in， get a couple of ways to do it， one way that you can do it。

 but you got to know what you're doing， is just go in， take the shoulders。

 and just pull them out like that， boom， that's one way to do it， another way to do it。

 is get a sort of a waging， beside them， tap tap， as soon as they turn， do this。

 and they'll just kind of draw around， or do this， now if I go to pull the shoulders like that。

 what I'll usually do is， I'll just tap tap tap， like that， like I'll just go tap tap tap。

 like draw them out， because if they feel like， there's some kind of force。

 that they're uncomfortable， with being used on them， then immediately， they're going to lock up。

 so you kind of just， you can just go in， hey guys， throughout， done， girls on the move， like I said。

 if a girl's on the move， if I see her going through the club， hey， like that， immediately。

 you just go， you do it quick， you do it thoughtlessly， you do it in the moment， a lot of the time。

 if a girl is walking by me， what I might do， like if she's walking towards me， is when I go to。

 when I go to， when I go to open， I'll open， I'll open the conversation。

 but I'll keep my feet planted， this is kind of an interesting one， as the girls walk by。

 and you open， they're going to be looking， to see if you're going to follow them。

 they're going to be looking， to see if you're going to kind of， weird them out。

 by sort of chasing them down， if you just keep your feet planted， and you keep talking。

 as they go by， and you just keep talking， you call that plowing， you keep talking， you'll find that。

 they'll sort of stop， and they go， okay， we'll come back， let's come right back to you。

 they'll talk to you， because they see that you're safe， again， don't be confined by the rules。

 I don't always do that， don't be confined by it， be empowered by understanding， how it works。

 don't be confined by it， so with your feet not moving， when they're moving by。

 they can see that you're in your own reality， you're safe， you're probably cool guy。

 they'll come right back， as they do that， as you keep talking， I remember one girl。

 who I dated for about three months， she walked by， and she walked about 20 feet， as I yelled。

 my opener， just kept yelling， and yelling and yelling， and she kept looking back， who is this guy。

 who is this guy， and eventually she just， and she shoved her friend off。

 because her friend didn't want her to come back， and she like jog back， and yeah， we dated for like。

 three months， we live in a different city， so we would have gone out for longer， but yeah。

 that's what happened， so yeah， I think， keep that in mind， the way that you approach。

 it's like a cat， you don't want to go into， you don't want to be like that。

 because they're going to feel that， they're going to withdraw， so you want to be talking。

 you see that comfort level， and that's as you progress forward， you guys will learn。

 you'll get the context behind this， when you go out， when you go out， then you review what was said。

 you get the context behind it， that's the only way， that you're going to get that context。

 how about when you approach a girl， who's a little bit of a girl， who's a little bit of a girl。

 how about when you approach a girl， who's a lone and who wants to find her friends。

 that's another example， you'll approach the girl alone， and she's looking for her friends。

 you're probably not going to win that one， sometimes you will， but a lot of the time you won't。

 you approach the girl alone， is looking for her friends， you talk to her， and she says。

 I need to find my friends， say， okay， here， you go help her find her friends。

 when you find her friends， talk to the friends too， get everyone going good。

 and then you go to these quick， quick responses， that you guys have。

 because you could be talking to a girl， and she needs to find her friends bad， and she loves you。

 she thinks you're awesome， but she's still going to want to go and find her friends。

 but if you respond quickly by offering， to help her to go find her friends， here， let's go。

 find them， take the lead， now you're with her， and then when you find her friends。

 they'll probably love you too， so that's fantastic， mix groups， guide girl groups。

 this is one that most guys， do not realize is one of the easiest ways to meet women。

 approaching a guide girl group， even one guy and one girl， can be a great approach。

 it could be her brother， it could be her gay best friend， you don't know who that is。

 when you approach， the guy， you want to talk to him， especially if it's just a guy and a girl。

 you talk to him， the girl will keep trying to get in the conversation， keep talking to the guy。

 she'll work harder and harder to get into that conversation， you can tease her， whoa， hold up。

 hold up， talk to the guy， keep doing that， she'll want to know that conversation is so bad。

 she'll be poking you， trying to get your attention， you go， all right， cool， okay， go ahead。

 what is it， that's that move that you can make， very simple， a lot of the， you know。

 I think on workshops， on boot camps， and one of the things that guys are so surprised by。

 like I was doing a boot camp last weekend， and there was a group of like stock investors。

 and I told him to open， he's like， but I couldn't， there's guys and girls there。

 I couldn't believe it， but I remember， I used to be the same one。

 I was too afraid to approach any guy or girl that were together， I said， look man。

 they're having a fun night， you're just chatting， ask them a question， they were into it。

 we're chatting， everyone had a fantastic time， made their night fantastic， made a great。

 think of it like that， don't be afraid to talk to anybody， in that venue。

 don't be afraid to talk to anyone， you can open conversations with anyone， anywhere， anytime。

 because that is who you are， so get used to it， and get that habit going。

 so we've discussed how to open， you guys will have to review your notes later。

 I basically discussed every possibility， of how you could open there。

 you don't need to memorize all of them， it's a lot of information， you can look it back over。

 for now， you just want to remember the basic parts of it， just the basic stuff。

 don't need to worry too much about all the complexities of it， got your notes there。

 you can look it back over， for the most part， what you guys need to know about how to open。

 is just tap the girl in the shoulder， and talk， and keep talking， until it hooks。

 that's what it comes down to， you just keep on talking until it hooks。

 and that leads us to our next， segment， which is the hook。

 the purpose of hooking is to make yourself stand out， from the other guys as quickly as possible。

 the girls are being approached by guys all the time， is sooner that you stand out， the better。

 how do you hook， you offer some kind of value to the night， you offer some kind of good thing。

 that makes you know， gives them a good experience to the night， maybe you make a comment about them。

 it's funny， maybe you tell them a story， maybe you use some kind of humor， whatever it is。

 you want to differentiate yourself， from all the other guys who are going， what's your name？。

 what are you from？， what do you do？， and doing the resume style question， this is probably。

 one of the big issues， with guys first learning to approach， is they go。

 let's bang off each other's resume， it's like a resume exchange， there's no fun in it。

 there's no spark， there's no playfulness， you want to add in that playfulness。

 and that is what the hook is about， that is what the hook is about， that is what the hook is。

 being playful， separating yourself， from the legions of other guys， when you're being playful。

 like say that your tongue is story， say that you're showing them something interesting。

 when you're doing that， you're doing it for your own amusement， it's for you。

 when you're getting her reacting to you， you're doing it for fun， you've got to watch that frame。

 so many guys will get stuck in that， dancing monkey。

 I'm trying to impress the girl with entertainment frame， it's a terrible frame to get stuck in。

 will kill attraction， will not go anywhere， the way that you can tell， you know how you can tell。

 if you're stuck in a dancing monkey frame， because as soon as the entertainment runs out。

 they walk off， that's how you know， you become， you're not， interesting， you're entertaining。

 you're not attractive， you're just entertaining， and that's a good starting point。

 you know if you guys， look if you guys can go out tonight， and just entertain ten women。

 and have that go well， that could hugely build your confidence， that's a good starting point。

 but at some point you need to look at， where you're giving your power away， where the leak star。

 and where you're giving away your power， and sort of plug them， and that's where that comes in， so。

 let's talk about some ways that you can hook quickly， hook him fast， distinguish yourself。

 make yourself stand out from other guys， first one that comes to me， to mind for me is cold reading。

 if you guys don't know what cold reading is， try to find some source on it， it's interesting stuff。

 women are really into it， it's funny because women usually， don't remember our conversations。

 but if you hit them with a good cold read， they'll almost always remember that， what a cold read is。

 is a generic observation， that you can make about somebody， that applies to almost all people。

 so for example， you know， to a shy girl， you might say， you know， you're very。

 you're very introverted， and probably some people， misinterpret that， and think maybe you're bitchy。

 but I think that you're the kind of person， that just likes to hold back。

 and see what you can learn from people， before imposing your personality onto them。

 that's an example of a cold read， a cold read is like， it's like saying， you guys are very feisty。

 you guys are bad， you guys are crazy， you guys are the most evil girls， in this entire place。

 that's like playful cold reads， those are actually probably superior， right off of the opener。

 the other one I said is probably more later on， so a cold read。

 is anything where you make a comment about them， to get some laughing。

 when you guys learn about cold reading， you actually might find it somewhat addictive。

 because girls will laugh and giggle， and they'll laugh at any cold read that you give them。

 and so I don't know， there's just something about that， don't get too hung up on it。

 cold reading is something that's supposed to be the pepper on the steak， it's not the steak itself。

 teaching them something of interest， that's a phenomenal one。

 whenever you can just immediately teach them something， see guys will come in。

 they'll go in and immediately start trying to ask questions， but when you can teach them something。

 bang， you have a hook， right there， you have it immediately， like if you say， if you said to a girl。

 you know you have， a good girl face， but every so often， you make like a little bad girl mannerism。

 and just teaching her something about herself， what does that mean about her。

 you could say what qualities about her， what that means， you can show her。

 you have a ring on your finger， on this finger， that means that you're very feisty。

 anything that you could show her， about her personality right away。

 you've got attraction right there， anything that you can teach to her， it's great。

 now the one future adventure's projections， this is an interesting little humor format。

 that I figured out， whenever you can talk about， some kind of made up scenario with you and that girl。

 where you're kind of cool， and she's kind of like dorky and bratty， she will laugh at that。

 so say that you say to a girl you know what， if I didn't have to go I would adopt you。

 you could be my new little sister， I could wrap you up， in a little bulb wrap envelope。

 and I pack you my suitcase， and I bring you back to L。A。 with me， we would roll down the street。

 like you'd be on this arm， every girl will be jealous of you。

 that's an example of future adventure's projection， you know I would， you know I would。

 you know we could go， we could go to Greece， and where togas， you could still lemonade。

 you'd be good huh， you still lemonade， you're feisty okay， anything going in that direction。

 future adventure's projection， you know you going to Vegas with her， taking her half her money。

 anything as old David D。 want， anything like that， is great。

 anything where you talk about you and her together， in some dorky scenario。

 now see sometimes I teach this， like you know one guy taught this to you。

 and he's like he's like okay， I'm like here you know around boot camp。

 I said okay give me an example he's like okay， I'll say to her， me and you will go to Miami。

 and I'll get a nice hotel， and we can stay in it， right。

 and that's not a future adventure's projection， okay， that's a supplication， that's not cool。

 so it's supposed to be in some dorky situation， it's supposed to be silly， funny。

 another great one is conspiracies， conspiracies are awesome， awesome。

 whenever you can create a conspiracy， with you and that girl， she's gonna love that。

 say that you walk around the club， and tell people that you just got married。

 she's gonna get so into it， she's gonna start giving the details of it， she's gonna play with it。

 say that you walk around the club saying that your brother and sister， you know do we look alike。

 yeah our mom was like this， our dad did this to us， anything like that， any kind of conspiracy。

 even like tricking people together， whatever it is， busting them on their mannerisms。

 that one is awesome， girls like guys， girls have certain mannerisms， that they do unconsciously。

 without thinking about it， and when you tease them on it， it will drive them nuts。

 so for example say， you know what， you guys are girl coding each other。

 they'll say what does that mean， you say you know what， every time you guys go to talk。

 you look at each other first， and then what they do when they start laughing， hysterically。

 they look at each other again， so you'll see that they'll do， like they'll look and laugh。

 and they'll go， ah like that and they'll look back， and they'll go， ah like that。

 totally blows them away， you know even if， even when you， you know if they're like， they're like。

 when you， you know if they touch you， and you're like， like that， the reason why women touch you。

 is to apologize， have you guys ever seen that？， women will always touch you。

 as a way of pumping your state， they do it all the time， so if a woman tries to touch you。

 to apologize， and you go， like that， then to apologize， she'll try to touch you again。

 and they'll totally， flip her out， because she's done it twice， or you can even take。

 the opposite direction， like as if taking it more， than it is， it's all that， playing with them。

 just constantly teasing， playing with them， push pull， push pull is old-school， concept that we use。

 in this kind of thing， you know， you're either one of the coolest girls， I've ever met。

 or you're like a total weirdo， that's push pull， it's when you give that compliment。

 like you say you know， you know you're amazing， you're kind of a brat， it's like that compliment。

 with that little tease after it， that allows you to compliment them。

 and allows you to say something good about them， without giving your power away。

 that's a lot of the time when you guys learn push pull though， they get so caught up。

 and anytime I compliment， I have to do a little tease after。

 but they can never give a genuine compliment， I think that sucks。

 I think you should be able to give a genuine compliment too， and not have to push pull it。

 you know not have to calibrate it， but point is， yeah push pull is great， I mean anytime that you。

 what you're basically doing is you're giving the validation， pulling it away， that's the formula。

 I'm giving you the validation， I'm pulling it away， it's kind of like I'm a chump。

 that's what it is， I'm just like every other dude trying to like， put you on a pedestal。

 compliment you， no I'm not， so it's like you're playing， and you'll be amazed。

 because this is kind of like what we call girl humor， it's a girl's humor。

 when you see a guy doing push pull， on a girl that you're with， and she's laughing hysterically。

 you won't see the humor in it， it's like what is it， what's so funny about it's not even funny。

 she's getting her validation， sort of push back and forth， it's just driving your nuts。

 because it's like who's doing this， it makes you totally unpredictable， it makes you fun。

 it makes you stand out， it's just about making that girl， making yourself more unpredictable。

 unless boring than the average guy， to make that girl have so much fun with you。

 she's dying to be around you， she just can't get enough， all right the elastic band。

 snap back effect， I realize a while back， very weird phenomenon， goes back to that validation thing。

 this will trip you out of it， when you see it， if you say to a girl， are you drunk。

 what's the first thing she's going to say， no I'm not， even if she is right， is that your friend。

 is that your friend， these are not my friend， even if it is， they'll always say that， you know what。

 I hate you， I know you're evil， you are the root of all evil， I hate you， immediately。

 no I want you to love me， tell me what I can do， tell me what to do， you know I think a drunk girl。

 says tell me what I can do to make you like me， I think sober girls think that。

 but the drunk girls are just the ones that say， I think the girls think that。

 they want that approval， that's the last thing that's not that， it's like saying if you kiss a girl。

 and she gives you like a week kiss， you say you know I don't want to like。

 you know I don't want to like， go over the line or anything， but I just want to tell you like。

 you know you're not like， you're really good kisser， and she'll be like， what？， like that yes I am。

 I'll prove it to you， you know you tell a girl， are you a good dancer。

 I bet you can't dance can you， yes I can， any kind of little challenge that you wish you like that。

 they will come back at these little funny little challenges。

 that you throw at them and they'll bring you back， again this is a lot like those cold reads。

 like a playful cold reading， where it's so automatic。

 that you can become hooked on it and guys want to do this。

 constantly non stop and they want to be coming monkeys， that's not what this is about。

 there's nothing to do with that， all right， disqualification， whenever you disqualify yourself。

 it's funny to watch how girls will respond to that， anytime that you do。

 just literally disqualify yourself， from being a possible boyfriend。

 say you know what I'm a bad man， I'm evil， you're not evil， you're not evil， you're not evil。

 and then they'll come back like that， anytime that you disqualify yourself。

 girls will chase it's an immediate thing， qualifying and challenging， you know are you fun。

 you know you're not fun are you， I only hang out with people that are fun。

 immediately jump through your hoop， yes I'm fun what you doing she's qualifying herself to you。

 great， you're talking sexy but you're seeing something retarded， is a basic formula。

 right that's the basic formula， anytime you cross things up。

 you make it silly you hit that humor point， silly games。

 let me show you an example of a silly game that， that papa made up， that when he showed it to me。

 I thought it was ridiculous， works every time， it's awesome， okay， check it out， okay you're set up。

 okay we got a video tape here， okay do you know the， LA handshake。

 okay put your hand back like this， okay and go like this， okay not too hard， okay， good， like that。

 snap， okay snap it， okay awesome okay here do it again， okay don't try and lead。

 see you know I wouldn't get along you know why， because I'd be trying to lead。

 and you'd be trying to lead， alright so let go， good good， excellent。

 alright here this is a new york handshake， it's a bit simpler so it might be more your speed。

 alright go like this， like that， like that， okay oh you got it， good job okay good。

 okay I'll do one last one okay， alright here go like this， like that， like that。

 I don't know what that is， some drunk girl show me that and I liked it， that's where we go。

 okay alright， now if you guys look at what I'm doing on that。

 what I'm okay see how like the giggling right， that's because I'm looking at you right in the eye。

 and you feel the pressure it's like what's this guy doing， like I'm talking about okay。

 so I'm going in like that， and I'm saying to you don't take over。

 right I'm saying put your hand back， you see what I'm communicating here。

 what I'm communicating when I think you're put your hand back。

 I'm communicating like that leadership quality， like moving her around it's like here come here。

 come over here when you do that to the girl， you're leading her around。

 she goes almost into like little girl mode， and she feels like protected by you。

 she's being led by you， and that's what will generate attraction for you， so I'm having fun。

 so I'm taking control of， it's just silly， it just gets her outside of her head。

 it just gets her you know having fun， you know another one old school， here's the old school one。

 remember this， oh you do remember that， gotcha， here I let you have me， don't see me get me。

 I'm not that good， oh pain， okay so see that's that same thing， you know another good one。

 here's a good one，OK ready， Victory， got it，I win，OK anything，anything to just drive in us。

any that silly stuff，it's great，you can do that right off the opener，you get a hook quickly。

get them laughing，most guys if they hear the stuff， they're like that's stupid，that's stupid。

because they think that they've got to be， look at the guys in the club，look at them，they're weak。

they think they're Jay's bond，they go through the club，they're like，they're like。

every guy is doing that，the reason why they're going through looking all serious。

 is because they want to put themselves above all the other guys， but every other guy is doing that。

to be the cool guy in the club，be the guy that's having fun，be the guy that doesn't give a shit。

be the guy that's having the time of his life，that's how you'll be the cool guy in the club。

whatever you feel like just going on impulse，just like what the girls are doing。

that is how you'll be the cool guy in the club，be the guy that's having a great time。

 imitating the girls or other people，imitating them，anytime you can imitate their accents。

anything about them，fantastic，why is that？，because as soon as you start imitating that girl。

she knows that you're not under control，she knows she cannot control you if you're imitating her。

and if you start imitating other people，she'll go stop that's horrible，so you guys see how you open。

hey what are you guys drinking？，hey how's your night going？，hey guys i need an opinion。

do girls think the rocks are David Bowie is hot？，hey you know what？，you guys are so adorable。

i had to come over here and meet you，any of these kinds of things，any opinion， you know，compoint。

you want to come over and meet them， theres something silly about them。

you want to come over and meet them，find out whats going on，whatever it is。

as long as you're confident， congruent with it and you plow through，until you get that reaction。

you know how you have guys that will be like，what's the best。。。，hey whenever i do media。

what's your pickup line？，what's the best pickup line？， guys are so obsessed with pickup lines。

your pickup line is the last thing that's on your mind，what's on your mind is your eye contact。

your voice，your humor，your positive state，that's what matters，you should be able to go on with。

 whaah，whaah，whaah，whaah，whaah，and that doesn't matter，anything to open，just open。

go in don't think open，so go in，you open，you're in，good， plow through，you're in that conversation。

 now you hook，do something silly， thomers，whatever you want to do，now you've got that。

the next thing that you want to do，and again you don't really have to stick to this order。

so don't worry about it，is have some kind of touching going。

now when i say that i almost feel like the creepy man，is like get the touching going。

is not like that，is just a natural part of interaction，is a physical person。

that theres some kind of touching going，the first thing that you guys can understand。

is the word pinging， pinging is the kind of communication that women use。

is a sort of touch communication that they use with each other，and they use with guys，so for example。

if you touch a girl，if you you know，if you say，if you go up to a girl，and she likes you。

and you're like，like that，what's she going to do back？，you can hit me，is ok，good，all right。

they'll hit back，that's called pinging，if you poke her，what's she going to do back？，exactly。

that's pinging，that's back and forth，and she was at a store，and i poked a girl，and she actually。

didn't see coming，and she was like，and then she realized，she missed the pinging，and she went。

like that，and she was like，make up for her mispinging，that's a，that's pinging。

the girls are always pinging，so you can always get that kind of like that shoulder bump。

and the girls she bumps you back，very playful，very fun，is just that you know that fun stuff。

that's pinging，and her sand how that stuff works，also，don't be the last one to want more pings，ok。

don't be the last guy trying to，you know trying to get those pings，like you know，you touch her。

she touches you，and then you're like，I love you who feels good，and you're trying to get more。

just not on the breast，yeah not，yeah not on the breast，so，that's pinging，ok another great one。

this is awesome， awesome，ok what i'm going to teach you guys，i love this stuff。

teaching something that is，physical in nature，anything that you can teach the girl。

and it's physical in nature，she's going to love that，because girls love human contact。

just like guys do，we're all the same，we're all human beings，but，because you're teaching。

you're something，it's ok，that's how it works，you remember i was talking about，social conditioning。

one of the first things in female psychology，is that they don't want it to be their，responsibility。

but if you're teaching them，something，hey，you just teaching me something，great example，alright，ok。

you're my next victim，ok，i hope you're comfortable，your sexuality。

because you're about to get some stuff here，alright，so one thing that i'll say，ok i do this。

this is awesome，ok，come here，so this is what i'll do，watch careful，i'll say，ok。

let me show you something， guys always ask me，how do you transition this。

can you just transition this，yes，just transition to it，let me show you something，now go like this。

now watch，if you go to give a girl hug，and you just jump like that，and he doesn't even like it。

ok he's a guy，so，alright，so that's not cool，but on the other hand，potential，ok，if you go。

ok what i'll usually do，is like go here，go like this，see，now watch how this works。

if i'm going to go like this，she doesn't know what，if i say，you know，it's not there yet。

so she just goes，ok，so go like this，ok go here，see what i'm doing，ok good，ok give me hug，ok good，ok。

ok，you guys see that，speaking，ok，you guys see that，you guys see the，segment that i did that，in。

there's a sort of a，secance that you，e，you can always do that，ok，so go hey，you put your arms。

 over that，good，ok，good，ok，now if they resist，because they're，not comfortable with it。

 what do you do，go，that's it， back off，now， go no，it's ok，don't be the guy， who's always。

 pushing forward，你真的懂說不懂，你選擇那麼rave，你真的要給 guy，噦了，就快點，就頗，就好了，然後把他，熬來， había，所以我也對你，而他們，是怎麼 Bunny，發動。

走即速，走進去，所以，摸起來，姶姜，梵，屁，然後就會，因為，現在戴手勢，我會這樣，我會覺得很興趣，你會有壓力在你的背後，好，我會這樣，我會這樣，對嗎？，我會這樣從我身上，這樣，這樣，好，這樣很興趣。

你會看你眼睛看你的背後，看你的背後，對嗎？，你會覺得很興趣，很興趣，很興趣，對嗎？，因為眼睛看起來很興趣，你會這樣，這樣，這樣，對嗎？，然後看這個，然後我會覺得很興趣，那個，好，那錢，這些小朋友。

擔心我會這樣，就是 señorigma，就是け起來，喔，就這樣，很興趣，所以我 leak，因為你會偏偏，你不會這樣，你會這樣，這樣，就是这样做出一个画面，你不想找个画面，你的缘子，你看不见我。

你可以看半个画面，这历史很多，我们画顿亮面，道地去看，这拥有一步，它们没有画，这是我画的，你说它说螳螃蟻，它别吊在，它我们想看它的画面， Pero，， Mike，，你進去行，，鉢石鉢，，等等我的試試，。

爬上去…，童仔出來的，，爬上去ガト，爬上色門是…，鄭格哥 Dob，能坐在前面下嗎？，它能，是很感觉，什么自己可以闹，这个是比 kills，更高，这样做 That girl，洁是你，那你想死。

这方法是 der，你让她能够 handy，你让她是可以，她当义，我 mean ultimately success would be。

Ir sex or a new friend who you want a girl who you want me friends with。

 right but the point is that a success in a little piece like that would be that。

 she was cool with it， she enjoyed it and added value to her night and it was fun，ok that's all。

 yeah， anyway you know you cross that barrier but again。

 I showed you guys a lot of subtle pieces there， you engage it but you also are the one who disengages it。

 it's like if you take a girl and you kind of have it up against the wall like that。

 and she likes it， she's cool with it， but you also kind of want to be the guy to kind of let it back。

 and then you know you can go add it again and then you can kind of let it back。

 next one moving her around， do you have a question。

 should you always be the first one to disengage like no matter how you。

 touch whether be holding hands don't get don't yeah with the holding like。

 don't be confined by rules so many guys are so okay。

 it's horrible because the more advanced the the tech of the technology gets。

 like the more useful things that we have to teach， the more guys just get screwed up man。

 they get screwed up by this stuff because their heads are so full of information。

 they can't just enjoy the moment as a general rule if you're holding hands with a girl。

 you might want to kind of let go and see if she'll keep holding to see if she's。

 cool with it and if you let go and she doesn't keep holding let it go。

 let her you know let her go and just keep the interaction with her keep enjoying。

 but I mean I like to I like to disengage before it gets to that point。

 where I'm leaning towards her too much is getting too needy at the same time。

 sometimes you just want to do whatever you want to do and it's right in the moment。

 and that's cool too you ultimately you're only going to learn the stuff by going out。

 it's you know you can have these sort of guidelines and whatnot but。

 you're gonna learn this by going out you're gonna learn by making mistakes。

 you're gonna learn by making a lot of mistakes until you have that perfect sense of the way。

 to interact with the woman that makes her comfortable and excited and having fun and you're gonna you'll get that sense。

 moving her around is great next piece moving her around。

 just like I showed you with the handshake thing， come here come over here move them around lead them get make it so they're being led。

 so they feel protected by you and safe around you so they're enjoying themselves。

 moving them around poking we talked about that that's like the pain。

 high-fiving great way to tell how comfortable girl is with you it's very funny。

 just just do a random high-five any time's a good time for a random high-five。

 you're just talking you're like yeah high-five go like that and you'll see。

 if the girl really likes you she'll be like all like all into it and if the girl doesn't like you。

 she'll kind of go she'll go like that and she'll do like the stiff handed。

 high-five with no effort on her part or just no high-five at all。

 that's a quick way to see where you're at it's very interesting。

 don't get too caught up in always trying to figure out where you're at。

 it's just an interesting way to see it's not a big deal tickling。

 great for later on tickler a bit wrestling， hair pulling， neck biting。

 all good stuff slowing down your speaking， how do you kiss a girl slow down your speaking slow it down。

 get closer triangular gazing what is triangular gazing。

 triangular gazing is a natural pattern that you'll see。

 when girls want to be kissed they'll start looking down towards your lips。

 they'll look at your eyes down lips eyes down lips eyes。

 that's what she wants you to kiss her usually to engage that you can be the。

 one that does it first so you can be looking at her and start to look down like that。

 oh yeah you can feel the gain is can't you so see that's why。

 I works on a girl so so that's the you know that's trying to。

 are gazing good little piece you slow down you get in a lot of you guys。

 probably you guys might have noticed that I put touch very early including kissing。

 not always but very often times you can be kissing girl very quickly if you want。

 if you so choose to do that it's fine back scratching。

 another good one smelling hair right you know how I've kind of put stuff。

 like tickling back scratching biting smell here it's kind of。

 like these different varieties of touch so that you can actually create different。

 sensations in her that's more exciting than just the typical the typical。

 group of the average man okay you can have something kind of more interesting。

 more sexy more seductive that's what you know that's really what。

 touches all about so look why don't we recap this。

 before we go any further you know we've got about just a couple。

 minutes here we want to recap this so that you guys can go out tonight。

 and implement what you learned so what you guys have learned today let's recap。

 it quickly we talked about your core fundamental beliefs that you have to。

 have not putting women on a pedestal being who you are not seeking their approval。

 you know not worrying about your money your looks。

 none of that stuff matters it does not matter at all。

 what matters is the confidence that you bring in your body language。

 eye contact voice charisma all that stuff your humor humor。

 some point humor confidence those two things， and everything that goes along with those two things that is what will make women。

 attracted to you you learn to stand out， we talked to you about female psychology logic。

 and emotions and have those two pieces are always。

 canceling each other out we talked about social conditioning。

 and how women never want you to put the responsibility on their shoulders。

 how you have to take a lead we talked about leading talked about the body language that you need。

 we talked about how to open plowing when you guys go out tonight。

 if it doesn't work right away keep talking bring up other funny topics。

 plow through it obviously that will result in some rough landing。

 but you will get some and as you get as you get some successes。

 you'll see what I'm talking about here about how if you just keep moving forward。

 you'll get what you're looking for when you open， look at the situation it's like a cat。

 you go down you don't want to freak the cat out you don't want to go。

 you don't want to cross that line once you once you've entered into a conversation。

 hook make yourself stand out from other guys quickly don't do what the average man does。

 giving you way more examples than you guys need here。

 you guys need about one of these examples that I've come up with。

 why did I give so many examples so that you can pick。

 I give you a lot of examples so you can pick not so you can stack them one after another。

 in a substitute for a regular conversation， not for that。

 as a teacher that's a really tough line for me to walk because on one angle。

 of course you guys to rely on yourselves but on another you know on another hand。

 I know you guys want something so I've got to give some examples but take them as examples remember this。

 this is being tape record so every example I just gave you guys is toast。

 it's done you have to make your own variations， you must make your own variations of this make up your own stuff。

 go in there get the touch going get it going quickly。

 physical connection so that the girl feels a good physical connection with you so you don't wind up in a situation where she loves you to death。

 but because you haven't crossed that boundary it's like this awkwardness is there。

 remove that awkwardness from her life and you're like quickly。

 so what I want you guys to focus on tonight is you're going to go out。

 you're going to get out there you're going to decide how many women that you're going to approach。

 you're going to make that decision of how many women that you're going to approach tonight。

 you're going to count them out make your choice， you're going to get out there with your friends and you're going to do them。

 you're going to make yourself stand out from other guys quickly。

 you're going to break through that physical connection barrier so that you're both really comfortable in that。

 of interaction and for now that's it that's all that you've got to focus on for tonight。

 because that's a big start that would be a great start guys。

 and what I want to see is I want you guys to come back in tomorrow and tell me stories。

 about how you guys went out last night picked certain number of girls you're going to open。

 when and did it took your lumps got some good ones。

 you're going to get a lot of attention across those bears and got that comfort going。

 so let's focus on that for now you guys see how we're just keeping it very simple。

 very natural we're not making this into some giant formula。

 you don't have to change into some kind of pick up superhero to do this。

 you guys have the tools you're born with the tools to track women。

 you've got them you're going to go out tonight and you're going to use them。

 and you're going to get comfortable with it and you're going to wake up a part of yourself。

 so I'm excited to see that so we're going to wrap it up for today。

 we're going to come back in another minute like just for a short break。

 to talk about where you guys are going to go tonight because I'm going to send you guys out。

 but we're going to wrap it up for today a lot of information information overload。

 talk about it with each other but when you go out tonight let it go。

 let the information go go out there and have a good time。

 and you'll be amazed how things will take care of themselves you guys will be amazed at it。

 so let's wrap it up for today short break thanks for listening to me today guys。

 and we'll pick it up again tomorrow okay。
