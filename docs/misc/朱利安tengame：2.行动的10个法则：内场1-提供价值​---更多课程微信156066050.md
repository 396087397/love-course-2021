我也 like starting with these， coz it really shows the difference between。

 someone who is in their own way or not， someone who is offering value or taking value。

 someone who is making themselves feel good， or depending on someone else to feel good。

 and someone who is real， or somebody who is not real， and then beyond that too。

 you can kinda see the communication， and the win-win mentality， at play， but I am gonna play it。

 i'm like ok what did you learn from this， and you are all gonna point out action。

What do you mean like it's transferring into the reactions，What do you mean。

We're all from a lot of that，I would say even if they didn't speak the language。

Just like your energy coming off them， Yes，They would be， they'd understand，Ok， so this is big。

Realize the game is preverable，It's impossible to fully put this in a words。

If you had to explain this to your friend who didn't see it，Who didn't emotionally recognize it。

 You can only cover a bit of it， Like you know， It was fun， it was free from the outcome。

 That makes sense logically，但其實你可以100元，這樣做正宜，但nike知道，增加如何，重顧，似乎達上，也許是，相比，成為，這段零零，結果，不過，去年，洞，你要滿意。

出得任何，漂亮， After，就好像，像，传ads，那鍵，手巔，瀳，要調整，又話， messing，而，你能夠，發声，這是，只要，都比較有怪物，好像，Z kill，B，而不良了，她们传THE。

你對方經病，輸出 humanitarian services，如果你可以，每次都會跟中國有關，你要讓你要 這種傲子，電話是說剛頭尚和，他聽我說的，因為那你就要做這個，但你為什麼做那個，你就別宮說。

就是when i'm saying or doing it，那怎麼辦，那在課要2，說成 simple，那總是，高年初，所以那絮詳急，那其實是，這樣不符合，以為可以做，所以那似乎，預動，移動，坐糙道。

是最重要以前，唐耀，但是， There is also the fact that I am aware of the girl， and interactions to people， So。

 notice how I don't just jump to period blood， I might say the fuck me Frodo think first。

 If when I say， hey say fuck me， You know， I'm Frodo or fuck me Gandalf or something like that。

 And she's like， Like she doesn't say with a huge smile like this girl did here， She's like， eh。

 I'm not gonna stack on period blood， That's a sign like， okay anything more than that。

 Won't be relatable， I'm still gonna be real， But being real is not just one thing。

 There's many things I could say or do， that are real congruence and they make me feel good。

 Not just， it's not like I'm stuck on like I have to say the period blood。

 So I'll just pick another course of action， It's kind of like， I'm generating my fun。

 And at all times it's like， you do a bit of fun， You look， she's still part of it， More fun。

 you look， she's still part of it， And you can generally tell by the tenseness。

 If there's any kind of tenseness saying her body language or eyes， She's kind of like， eh， eh。

 like that， Maybe take some steps back， Nervous little giggle， She may say stuff like， oh are you。

 are you drunk？， Are you on drugs？， What's up with you？， Shit like that。

 Means you gotta slow it down， You're approaching that limit。

 Where you could be too far out that it's unrelatable， It doesn't mean that the interaction's over。

 Just like， you got some warning signs， And this is actually important to understand with rejections too。

 Guys tend to think， The girl loves you or hates you。

 And she could switch from loving you to hating you like that， And that's what stifles you， Like。

 that's what gets in your own way， Is you're expressing yourself and you're like。

 If I do one little fuck up， She'll hate me， It's black and white， No， rejections gradual。

 If a girl loves you， she's not gonna switch to hating you， She'll give you， Those signs beforehand。

 She'll signal like too much pressure， Too much pressure， too much pressure。

 And if you just keep blindly doing your thing， Then yeah， you could get the， eh， okay。

 have a great night， You're like， with that came out of nowhere， No。

 they were all the signs beforehand， They just didn't see， The same as if you're a little too boring。

 What are the signs of too boring？， Too loose， She's like， uh-huh。

 That's when you got to maybe amp it up， With some period blood talker signs， Okay， Now。

 amp it up with something， And she'll give you more signs， Like， too boring， too boring， too boring。

 Okay， bye， Oh， the rejection came out nowhere， It's like， no， there's always the signs beforehand。

 Okay， and this is actually， Something that once you cultivate it， Like。

 still being aware of the girl， Like， expressing yourself， You should not get， quote unquote。

 bad rejections， You know， we're gonna get into a rejection compilation， They're really not bad。

 Most rejections are like， ah， nice to meet you， Guys are like， well， where are the crazy rejections。

 Where she's like throwing her drink， It's like， what the fuck？， Like， that should never happen。

 Like， never happen， As long as you're aware of this， Okay， social awareness， big， Okay。

 and it communicates a lot of value， The fact that you are aware。

 That you are able to change courses of action， And， That you don't lose， quote unquote。

 state over it， Because that'll happen， too， Guys， get stuck on this one thing， It's like。

 I gotta say the period blood， And if I don't say it， I'll feel horrible， Or I'll feel like。

 I compromise who I am， Or I'll feel weak， And they'll say， for example， Frodo， And say， she's like。

 eh， Fuck， I can't say the period blood， Ah， whatever， And they lose state， So。

 it's not sticking to a plan， It's having your identity， Or your ego like， invest in this one thing。

 It's like， you gotta be fucking flexible， And she'll see that， Like， oh， he's flexible。

 And he's socially aware， Because that， too， If you're not socially aware。

 And the fact that you just keep doing that one thing， And when she's not relating to you， Like。

 she's not relating to it， You'll lose massive value， She's like， well， if this guy can't tell。

 That I'm not feeling comfortable， If he can't tell he's going too far out there。

 Then I'm not relating， How can I trust this guy， How can this guy like be my fucking rock。

 How can I say if we have a kid together， How can I trust him to provide for us。

 And the kid in the world， If he can't be this aware of， Like， if he has no social awareness。

 He'll go out and get himself killed or something， I can't depend on him at all， You know。

 I'd have to do everything， He'd only depend on me， And no girl wants to be around a guy like that。

 Okay， it's extremely low value， Yes， What are the better signs of look for the non-burble。

 Or like the like her body language， Like， what are the more。。。， General tenseness， Tenseness。

 You'll sense it in the vibe， But it'll be communicated in body language。

 And what she says and how she says it， And that's stronger than like the sub communication side。

 Those are sub communications， Yeah， Yeah， it's like， If you feel like me， Oh， Yeah， Yeah， Yeah， Oh。

 Like that， It's like okay， slow it down， Yeah， Okay， Amp it up， For now。

 I just want you guys to kind of be aware of that vibe， Like that's what you have to aim for。

 And once again， it's now what I'm doing， What it should be， Like。

 What should get your mind spinning now， Is what the fuck do you do。

 What can you say to be that excited， Because I can guarantee you， No one else in that environment。

 That venue， Is， Offering that much value， Like no one， Is feeling better， This you know。

 Fucked as it sounds， As me， Talking about those， That period blood shit， No one's offering more fun。

 Is more carefree， And more passionate， And giddy about it， As me talking about that。

 And that's why she gets attracted， Other guys they go up， They're like， Hey， Trying to be cool。

 Or trying to take， And I was like， Oh， Period blood here， Check this out。

 No one does that。
