出了1個勢用的，所以那意思應該沿逝，1個目卉惶 mus，要争取3個歐補，可能特色，Now what does that mean finding your own lane。

well I'll teach you stuff at the time， even at hot sea transformation experiences。

 I'll bring guys up to the front， and what I do is I get them talking。

 and what they are always trying to do， is copy me， they are always trying to copy me all the time。

 and I watch them doing it， and what because of this， I know they are in reaction to me。

 so I'll mess with them， and they are constantly trying to react to what I look like。

 Like you know I deal with all the fun and I'm doing my job， you don't have a beard like this，蹲 闪躲你。

开始与你的音乐，因为他有一笔，我是允计啦，您跟我说的，バッ risku，中国歌议，伙伴，的火吧，下面的，不是，做首听，看 我客气，我握好，zhou，我需要去打赢 Bouchams，把他拿下很多。

每天的，這些，心理，這些，那個，時候，我們有一夜，事實，之前，HIP music，ample，所以我 first Kanye would sit there。

 Overlayering doctor judge beats， Just learning how to do it， Learning how to speak like that。

 Learning the cadence， Or how to produce like that， Learning the cadence of the drum beats。

 Things like that， Over time you went in completely different directions。

 You made an entire Alam's out of auto tune， Bit of a weird experiment。

 But probably helped him to learn and grow， He made all sorts of other weird things。

 They're totally different from doctor drew， You can barely even see where they're similar， And yet。

 Doctor drew who at that time was arguably the top producer， Kanye copied that，然後我會舉例為為《南非兒子謀》請me。

我看看寫чи  Comment 受歡迎  論演 我腯甪的進行， stressful react 收聽， initially learning， ok，enai，我想被作成一品，我立刻想些不知道。

 Rum cheers，�，呃，ヌ，嵐，我的 буду，我的，心 introduction，接下來，那就。。。

我 literally writing out the muscle tick commercial， as if it was an RSD commercial。

 so that I could learn how to market it， say I have a new product launch。

 I need to know how to market that product， I don't want to spend， you know，。

 4 years of building a product like Blueprint， that we don't even market it，， that to be an idiot。。

 So， I made sure before I put that out， to learn how the best people write sales copy。。

 Now if I do a sales ad，， not only can I do it without looking at those ads，。

 although I made referbacks to them，， which I think is smart，， but I can do it in my own voice。。

 And what used to take me a month to write a sales ad，， I could do it a couple hours。， Literally。

 I could do sales and marketing， boom just off the cuff，， just on speaking here，， off the dome。

 so to speak。， But that took me a long time to get to that point， and I got to that point。

 not by me arrogant，， or studying hot people，， but by actually copying what the greats and the masters were doing。

， Julien is one of my main game teachers in my life。， And literally， I would actually watch，。

 like even though it's weird，， because I taught him game at first via videos。

 like Blueprint Transformation's Foundations。， And then later by the time I met him，。

 he was further along a game， and I had been many of his areas。， And then I would learn back off him。

 and then he learned a lot of work， and stuff like me，， and he learned off each other。。

 And then basically what happened was，， I actually， like， so almost like I learned，， that he， like。

 I went to like here，， that he went to like here，， and then like， I had to catch up。， So you know。

 and I don't know for right now，， but it depends who goes out more，。

 but he's usually strong as I've seen。， So basically， what you have is like，。

 you're learning from great people，， but then you need to solidify your own style。。

 So take myself in my own style and game， right？， Like what are some things that I did there？。

 For one thing， I often tell girls， like，， I'm a nerd， I tell them this。， I tell them。

 I like to work a lot。， I tell them that I like to read a lot。， I tell them I'm in a meditation。。

 I tell them， what's that？， Tell them about your vitamins。， Oh yeah， yeah。

 we have all these like weird vitamins， and shit like that， I'll tell them about that。。

 I do that because they start to get this kind of， pieced thing together of like this person。

 who has his own kind of way of living life，， things like that。。

 And I'm not sitting there saying it as resume。， I'm just joking， I'm clowning。， The stuff is coming。

 the stuff is peppered in。， It really just not even ever intentionally brought up， ever。

 but just kind of mentioned。， You don't say I talk a little bit fast。， Well。

 if I talk a little bit fast， like right now I'm doing，。

 I could look like it could be interpreted in two ways。。

 One is I could look like I have a drug problem，， like I'm like，， like， ah， look at that。。

 And then there's I could look like an idiot，， Savant， who's extremely powerful and who's a leader，。

 which many people like Mark Zuckerberg， or Elon Musk's classic examples are kind of idiot。

 some of us。， Well， it's one thing to look like you have a drug problem。。

 It's another thing to look like you're in the same， playing field as Steve Jobs， Mark Zuckerberg，。

 and so on and so forth。， So you're giving a context for that。。

 I think those guys are light years ahead of almost any human， on earth as far as the results。

 but you see my point， right？， So you give a context to it。， Even things like not drinking， right？。

 When suddenly they realize why I don't do it，， it's pretty cool。， Now you also lose girls off that。。

 Sometimes you actually want to be more of a generalist， so you don't set anybody off。 It depends。。

 It's sort of different directions that you go here。。

 So realize that every truth is about a half truth。。

 Realize that every side of the coin has another side of the coin。。

 So I'm talking here about one side of the coin。， You could look at different sides of the coin，。

 like just being fun and giving no specifics， because you just get her home。。

 But there's elements to where， you know，， I can lay back to rolling bed or wherever else。。

 And this starts to come up。， They see as a congruent image。。

 And that congruent image fills in a painting canvas for them， to which they understand me。。

 And then when they understand me， they're willing to have sex。， Now we can also see this though。

 as far as how I carry myself and groundedness。， So when you just kind of own who you are，。

 there's two sides to that。， The first side is that in some ways。

 when you kind of just own who you are，， you're very grounded and it makes you come across more confident。

， But sometimes the people that are the most grounded， and the most eddies through they are。

 they improve the lease。， So there's sort of a balance that you want to strike there。

 between owning your own style， while still being coachable and teachable。。

 I was talking to Julie about this earlier。， Many of my best friends who are credible。

 like internet online gurus who maybe got to you watch，， I've learned a ton from them。

 but when I'm around them，， I just shut up and they talk at me。。

 And sometimes it'll kind of be funny。， Like one of them will make me making a video。

 and they clearly don't understand pickup。， And people will be like， oh。

 I thought your friends this guy，， why doesn't he even know what pickup is？。

 Surely he would be listening to you when you're hanging out。， And I'm like， now they're brilliant。。

 And I love them。， And they're my friends with their kind of uncochable，， at least by me。。

 Maybe they'd be coached by Nelson Mandelavi， who came back to life or something， right？。

 But not by me。， And I don't really care。， I just want to learn。， So someone wants to talk。

 I'll let him talk。， So basically， there's a combination， between still being coachable。

 still being somebody， who's learning from great sources。， I mean， guys like Julie and myself，。

 we can spend five， six， six， four years， on self-education， right？， Like these guys that are like。

 I don't need to do a program， and stuff。， I'm just like， well， I guess your results。

 are going to be what they are。， You know， Michael Jordan has 12 coaches。， You have zero。， You must。。

 Shit。， That's amazing。， So it's like you want to be a learning。， But at the same time。

 there's that other side of you， where you want to want to own B。R。， So I don't for me in the past，。

 I might feel nervous to walk up to a woman， and the fact that I've been nerd。

 and I'm going to try to look like some like me dealer， or club promoter。

 like some hitster or something。， Maybe I do a guy hitster， but okay。， You might， I mean， again。

 that balance， between a living Hollywood，， I kind of harmonized the environment，。

 but then otherwise it's a my own style。， So basically， at the time， I might have felt。

 like always in reaction， where it's now，， I feel like I'm the one triggering the reactions。。

 My deal rules， I'm at the club，， making out with a bunch of different girls， and people are going。

 it's the beard。， And that'll happen to me a lot。， Like I'll be at the club and people will be like，。

 like people will see me like with all these girls， and like they can't figure out why，。

 because I'm not like traditionally good looking。， And then they just start rationalizing，， oh。

 it must be the beard， right？， This is kind of a big joke。

 because I've been recording videos for about a year and a half。

 and I haven't put any out this year or very little。， So the few I put out。

 people like you grew up here，， oh， this bullshit and like，， it's so funny， isn't it？。

 You're from now。， Everybody's going to be saying it's the beard that did it。

 because people don't know what game is。， So they just see a result and they're going to seal this。

 in， feel come out from me。， And only this girl's responding positively。

 and they're going to think it's the beard。， But notice here， again， you don't say。

 you see that I try to beard。， Maybe you want to try it。， Maybe you try it with suit，。

 I learned it from other people。， I learned the beard game as I say，， beard like from other people。。

 But then I tried it and it kind of worked for me。， Now my beard's very full and thick。。

 So it works great for me。， For some people， your beard's one patchy。， Maybe you were stubble。。

 Maybe you were a long beard here， there's a joke。， You know， so you've got to recognize。

 where your strengths are。， In my case， I'm not a traditionally good looking guy。。

 So because I'm not traditionally good looking，， if this is like the graph。

 I'm on the edge of good looking。， I'm not in the center or traditionally good looking。。

 I'm on the edge。， So I play at the edge。， If I was at the center。

 I probably wouldn't do a big beard。， If I was at the center of good looks。

 or traditionally good looking，， I would just wear Abacrime and Fitch。

 or like a basic suit and it would look great on me。， Right？， That traditional assault looks great。

 on traditionally good looking guys。， Now I'm not a traditionally good looking guy。。

 So I'm not going to get a girl， that wants your midwestern boy traditionally good looking guy。

 who's clean cut。， Because if I look clean cut， I'm just going to，， I mean， I have my face shape。。

 I'm going to have shubby cheeks，， bolding，， pacy，， not that tall。。

 I'm not going to play well at that angle， right？， Like， you know， like，。

 I got to say Lewis Hals is an example， more of a traditionally good looking guy。。

 If Lewis goes and grows，， it's like giant beard and starts dressing。

 all fucking wild and fly and swearing， and all， you know， I don't know if you swear or not。。

 But you know what I mean？， Like， play as that angle。， If Lewis Hals is a pretty cool internet group。

， you could look him up。， That's not going to work for him。， But I mean， I mean， it couldn't，。

 it actually could work。， I'm sure he could make it work，， especially if that's really him，。

 but he doesn't need to do it。， Like， Lewis can play the center。， It is going to crush。， So I mean。

 again， just in my opinion，， he may have his own opinion， right？， It's not your action。。

 Give an opinion of someone on there， right？， Just， he's cool。， So basically， in my case，。

 because I'm not at the center，， I don't play the center。， And people can look at that。

 and think that's a little weird。， But when you come out with me，， if I'm doing well，。

 I'm going to be crushing it that night，， you're going to look at it。。

 You're going to start wanting to do what I'm doing。， Just like when I go with him，。

 I like with Julian，， I almost make a choice when I go to this guy。。

 I'm either going to like look at him， and learn from him。。

 I just fucking block him up like a Medusa。， Because he's so fucking，， he's so pimping game that，。

 like， I mean， he is the pin。， Like， you know， it's Julian，， motherfucking blog。。

 My wing has fucking Julian blog。， It's kind of crazy。， So if I look at him too much，。

 I've been started getting a reaction to Julian，， and then I'm not going to be able to do my own shit。

， Because my game is predicated， and I'm like not talking that much， and a lot of physicality。。

 That works for me because I have a osperers。， And this is how you can see，， like， I'm like。

 I could just talk for hours。， Just like， I don't know about， an osperers or not，， by the way。

 but I probably just do。， So， you know， some people like，， are you really？， I mean。

 take your best guess， right？， But the point is， like， I have that like wave about me。。

 So I don't talk that much in my game， because this is too，， the way I'm talking right now。

 is a bit too much for a role。， And then I go silent， and I do a lot of physical escalation。

 and I do a lot of nonverbal。， Because the thing that I want to talk about，。

 the girls don't want to talk about。， So that works amazing for me。， Now。

 he's verbal because he's really good， at engaging with girls，， like in their feminine mind。。

 Cause I always say Julien's like a HB10，， like super hot girl， like a man's body。， So basically，。

 Julien's really good at engaging with girls，， cause he knows exactly how they think。。

 So he's playing to his strengths by doing that， right？， I got like Jeff， he's very，。

 he's kind of like， I don't know if he called belligerent。， I mean， he's kind of in tell，。

 like Jeff goes intentionally belligerent， and intelligent。， He's like，。

 but tell belligerent or tell a tell a tell a tell a tell a， jerk，， so basically with Jeff，。

 he also plays， you know， in his strength。， Like Jeff is five but seven，。

 but you never think of Jeff as five but seven ever。， Do you？。

 You never think like that of Jeff at all。， So you think of him as taller。

 because he's playing to his strengths and he owns it。， As soon as Jeff no longer owns his strengths。

 and doesn't have his own swag and style，， you suddenly start calling him short，。

 you suddenly start calling him bad looking，， he say his face looks like a bird。。

 I'll give it a hand。， When he just does his thing，， you think of him as good looking，。

 you don't think of him as short， right？， If I'm doing my best job，， guys will be like，。

 you're saying that you're like a funny looking ginger， in your videos。

 but you actually look kind of cool。， Like what the fuck stuff with that？， If they see a pimp in it，。

 they're gonna think that it's funny on the works， right？。

 So basically the difference between like a bad looking guy。

 or a good looking guy is not even as much in his looks。， It's just whether or not he owns it。。

 Like take a look， look his like overweight right now。。

 But he's like a giggling fat boy wants a cake，， but you see him out there with like a super hot girlfriend。

 doing gorgeous and shit。， He's like， wow， he's really talented handsome。， He has very nice hair。。

 Right， you'll rationalize it。， So when you come into your own strengths， and you own it，。

 you probably even think like you need to get fat too。， Like if you see her like shit，。

 maybe I should get fat， like get that style to think。， It's true to be fair， what happened to me is。

， and this is the problem with being active in game。， I now see lean guys，。

 and I think they can't get laid， because they don't have a bit of manboo，， but in a belly，。

 and because they have too much hair，， unlike their hair's all thick。， I'm like， it looks so weird。。

 You know what I'm like，， I'm like in my mind，， I'm chubby right now。。

 I think I'm like a silverback gorilla with like，， I like in my mind，。

 my balding is like a silverback gorilla，， and my chubbyness shows that I'm powerful。。

 Instead of some like young guy， who's just like in the gym all day， because he has no power。。

 This is delusional。， It's not even healthy。， I'm just stop。。

 But because like you know what I understand？， That like my playboy， playmate girlfriend，。

 sucks on my titties，， and it's like I just love them and sucks on them。， I'm like。

 I don't even like you。， Cause like it's not really the kind of attention I like。， But like。

 you know，， and I say I'm gonna get lean， and she doesn't even want me to get lean。

 because she's attracted， and she doesn't know what she wants。， So like I was saying，。

 on one level it's gonna keep improving。， Like I wanna get into fitness and seri again。。

 Like I've been for many years。， But on another level，， when you own it，。

 it also produces great results。， Recognize that you wanna be coachable。。

 You wanna produce great results。， But at the same time，， you also wanna，。

 like wanna own who you are， and be comfortable with yourself， and be comfortable in your own skin。。

 Once you do that， again，， that's where you just go from being able to open certain groups。

 or open certain sets to closing a lot。， Where you get that girl back home， when you're chabbing。

 and she can see the complete congruent picture， who you are， your owning that persona。

 that who you are， and your playing to your strengths。， Again， like I said，， look up John Maxwell。

 and also，， and look up what's called your strengths zone。， I think it'll be very eye opening。。

 Remember the Kanye West example。， It's okay to start off by imprinting， what other people are doing。

 to get the rhythm and flow of it， and don't have an ego about that。， Guys have an ego about that。。

 Nuts，， delaying the results。， I've been over time，， keep incorporating more and more of who you are。

 and as you do that，， that's when your results are gonna go skyrocket， okay？。

 So I hope that what I'm saying made a lot of sense， here， Julian just came and asked me。

 to come and have some bonus content here， and it's a pleasure to do it。。

 I wanna thank Julian for having me on here。， Is there anything where you wanna add to it。

 or the good here？， The couple last points would be，， yeah， be willing to like try。

 like a bunch of different fucking lanes， even things where you don't know if it's like，。

 if this is you，， it's like try it and at some point， something will like just click。， You're like。

 oh shit， like，， you know， it's like， that's the one。， So it's like，。

 I did this in game where I just tried， a bunch of different things kind of found my style。。

 I did it in the dating videos。， Like if you go like in party，， join channel， like the first，。

 I'd say five， 10 are just kind of like general topics， until like the drama went hit， and I'm like。

 oh， boom， all out there。， That's the way to treat the bout success by the way。。

 I didn't wanna put out the truth about success videos。， I almost deleted it。， And then I was like。

 well，， I guess if people don't like it，， I could just take it down and then boom。， Yeah。， So yeah。

 you never know。， So it's like try a bunch and，， and then the videos I thought would be awesome。。

 No one even freaking responds。， That'll happen。， And also all my biggest videos on weekends。

 that I would shoot，， two videos of those weekends。。

 And I don't think one video is the awesome video。， And then the other one was like the okay video。。

 And those ones blew up。， In fact， funny enough， great example。。

 Where right now we're sitting outside， Seabed and Stakehouse in the wind in Vegas。。

 And here's the so funny。， The biggest video on the RC Tard Channel。

 was a video that I shot in Vegas， and there's shots from the Seabed and Stakehouse， in that video。。

 And funny enough， like that was the weekend， when that happened。， Like literally like I thought。

 this one video was so amazing。， Then it was okay。， And then it was okay。。

 And then when I thought it was awesome，， it was just like maybe got 100k views。。

 Maybe got 600k almost now。， So， and that was through testing different stuff。， You got to test。。

 Yeah。， You don't know what people will respond to。， And as you see the response，。

 you get excited about it。， And it actually is something you're good at。， And then it goes。， Yeah。

 and you don't know even like what you respond to。， It's like you're doing it like，， oh shit。

 like for the first，， it's like rediscovering yourself in a way too。， And yeah。

 it's like challenge yourself。， Like one thing I noticed to us with the travel，。

 like I'd be gone a couple months or a few months。， And then every time we'd meet again，。

 because we're away for a while，， like our game would develop a different style。。

 And then like we'd meet and every time it'd be like a two week，， or I'm like。

 what am I doing the right thing？， Like kind of like a challenge。， I don't know what you're doing。。

 So we'd be like crumble，， then build it stronger。， Crumble， so like there's those phases。

 you kind of have to go through as well。， Yeah。， Cool。， So right to the CD and master the CD。。

 Righting to the CD is trying new things。， The mastering it is where you own it。。

 It would be this time to broaden the musical interface。， So you get to meet all the。

 I really like theido part。， Yay！， Stars such a man！
