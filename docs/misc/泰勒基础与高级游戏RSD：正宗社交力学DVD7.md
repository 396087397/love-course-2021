 and how to make that part of the hookings device。。

 Does anyone else here have a good cold reader before I show how I do it？， OK。， Basically。

 the way that you do it， what of the most counterintuitive things about learning。

 to be good with women is that you can just spit stuff out and it doesn't have to fit。

 into the conversation。， It's a total shift in your headspace when you realize it is。。

你能 literally say random things at random times，and women will get sucked into that。

the way that you can think about it， is almost as if you were with Bill Clinton。

 or some really high powerful， high status person， and they just change up the topic of conversation on you。

 usually you'll just get sucked right into that， because there's that certain respect thing there。

 and a lot of the time when a man changes the topic on a woman， they just go with it。

 and in a lot of ways too， that's how women talk themselves。

 have you ever heard a girl talk on the phone before？， yeah they're just all over the place， so。

 are you about them specifically or are you talking about。

 you know you're doing a cold re-un on that， well I'm just talking how they think。

 so now so what I'm leading to， is that， a lot of guys will have to wait。

 they think they need to wait to a certain point in the conversation。

 before they can shoot in some funny little piece， when in fact you can be talking to a girl。

 she's acting completely normal， you say you are so feisty， and she'll lash and say why。

 and say you know why， see so it doesn't matter， you can just launch into that instantly。

 there's no there's no need to hold back， there's no need to you know there's no need to look for a perfect point in the conversation。

 to do it， same thing with launching into a story， if you launch into a story。

 it can be totally off topic， and you can launch right into it， no problem。

 you'll have no problem with that， yeah very very smooth， you make them part of it。

 you're like your feisty， you， you're really a bad girl， yeah I know that， I know that in my heart。

 evil， you're evil， alright， yeah and you just throw that in there， and they'll start giggling。

 do you do that too， also if you're doing you know if you。

 you know if you've got three or four people there， three or four women there， yeah you can say。

 yeah you can say you guys are evil， or you can look at the friends and say she is evil， alright。

 to the friends， and then they'll point in the lab， one thing I find so funny is that。

 anytime you call girl evil， they laugh， and I think that's a laughter recognition。

 I think that's like a laughter of， like they know like they know all the crazy things they've done。

 so it's like you know it kind of brings that side out of them， sure。

 and the funny thing is when you know when you call a girl bad。

 and you know when you're saying that she's feisty， you're giving her permission to act that way too。

 well there's no question it works， I mean I did it last night a couple times。

 and they absolutely think it's a it's a steric， yeah， they laugh， they sit there and they laugh。

 you know for friends are there she is evil， she you know and then you play the good。

 girl and the bad girl， you're actually the good girl， she's really the bad girl， yeah。

 and you just have a great time with it， yeah another great one is you say。

 which one of you two is the more dominant friend， which one of you which ones the boss。

 and then of course you know usually the one the one。

 who's the boss will sit there and the other friend will point at her， right。

 or you can confuse them you can say， you can say yeah she told me that you're the boss。

 even if the other girl didn't say that， so you can mess with them like that。

 yeah there's so many different ways that you can do it， cold reading is something that。

 actually works so well it's almost addictive， because when you do it， you know they laugh so much。

 because sometimes you might do it too much， but I mean I guess you know you were talking about the hooking before。

 and it's like you know when you go there， you open the conversation。

 and you just start making observations， you can throw stories out there。

 you throw cold reads out there， you show them stuff physically， you move them around。

 you take control， we talked about the sports team thing。

 where you know one sports team is scrambling， the other one is dominating。

 you want to just go in there， not let not in a reaction。

 not worry about how they're going to respond， but just going in there and conveying your personality。

 and just showing what you think is fun， the difference between the guy who's good with girls and the guy who's not。

 well you know among many differences， a major difference is that the guy who's good with women knows how to convey his personality。

 and put himself out there， he knows how to convey like you know， qualities like confidence。

 dominance， humor， you could have these qualities， but if you don't know how to convey them。

 it's not going to go anywhere， but if you do know how to convey them。

 you know we showed it yesterday， the handshake routine moving around， teasing her。

 so you're conveying your personality quickly， in a lot of ways， the art of meeting women。

 is the art of learning how to convey your personality very very quickly。

 so she can see different qualities about you， in as quick a time as possible。

 you want to think of it like that， did we have another question by the way？。

 so you guys at this point you feel like you understand it， you have a， a logical。

 understanding of how to do it， you understand it logically as a point of doing it。

 you know don't think that the only way to meet women is through cold approaching either。

 you guys know the easiest way to meet women is？， what's that？， hi yeah that's a good opener。

 the universal opener hi， the easiest way to meet women， is through your social circle。

 that is the easiest way to meet women， I think a lot of guys get so focused on you know approach approach approach。

 when in fact the easiest way to meet women is through your social circle。

 the reason why we learn approaching， is because you'll build the social skills that when you're back in your social skills will make you dominate。

 what you'll find is when you go out a lot， and you're putting yourself out there a lot when you go back to your social circle。

 you become a natural leader even if you weren't previously。

 and you know you go through a lot of transitions with that because sometimes your friends won't like it。

 a lot of the time if there's a pre-established role， like like a dynamic in a social group。

 if somebody starts to become more dominant， then the previously dominant guy that could make them uncomfortable。

 sometimes if you start to get ahead in your life， you know your friends will worry that you're not going to be friends with them anymore。

 and they can do little passive things to hold you back。

 there's all sorts of different transitions to go on whenever you。

 you know whenever you transform yourself， all sorts of things can happen。

 you can start to lose confidence in who you're becoming and want to go back and show behaviors。

 all sorts of things like that that go on， but in the end of the day。

 the guys that get girls are the ones that sort of understand what women are about。

 you know they understand that women are， they understand that women are emotional。

 they understand that women like sex， they understand that women are going out to have fun。

 they understand that women are going to respond to you qualifying yourself for trying to impress them。

 they get that stuff， they get the frame control， they get the sort of guys dominating each other kind of thing。

 they understand that women need discretion if they're going to have sex， and non-judgmental。

 I think guys that are good with women go with the flow， they're not mechanical， they're not robotic。

 they're not hollow， you know they have a lot of realness to them， they're having a lot of fun。

 they're bringing that kind of energy to the table， that is what they're bringing out there， that。

 not what most guys bring which is wanting approval。

 hoping that the girl will respond in the right way。

 hoping the girl will give them the right reaction， struggling to create conversation。

 you guys will have to build your conversational muscles。

 conversation skills is like a mental muscle， and you guys have to build that muscle。

 and it takes time， but when you build it， you have so much potential。

 a lot of you guys talked about how when you're on your own， or with friends。

 you can talk to your friends comfortably， you can talk to your friends with no problem at all。

 on the other hand around a woman， you feel these barriers， like you're not able to talk。

 if you guys have ever been around a guy who you thought was cooler than you。

 try to communicate with that guy， it's not going to feel anywhere near as comfortable。

 as talking to people who you're not concerned of what they think of you， that's the irony here。

 if you guys can see the irony behind this， the people， who matter the most。

 are probably the people who you shut down around， if you can get past that。

 a whole new world opens up to you， in terms of the jobs that you can get。

 the women that you can meet the friends you can meet the people who you can go out around。

 it's a fundamental difference， in the way that your mind works。

 looking at things as like an opportunity， and being afraid that you're going to blow it。

 versus saying screw it man， opportunities are going to come to me。

 and just being how you want to be， and that's really what this is about， it's like going out。

 chatting， having a good time， seeing those indicators of interest， seeing when she's touching you。

 seeing when she's leaning in， you know when you go away， is she looking for you， that kind of thing。

 you sense that， you see that the buying temperatures there， and you escalate a little bit。

 you convey your personality， you see that she's into it， you escalate a bit。

 you convey more personality， you see that she's into it， you escalate a bit more， move around。

 draw her into your world， make it fun， of course you approach a ton of women。

 you're not going to lot of doors， how do you do that， go out。

 that's what it comes down to is going out， so let's talk a bit about implementing a habit。

 I think one of the most important things that I had that a lot of guys don't have。

 is that when I was learning from people who were good。

 I never thought that I was cut from a different cloth than them。

 it was one of the major differences between me and most guys， I learned from a lot of great people。

 I had a lot of great teachers， and I appreciate all of them。

 some of them probably don't appreciate that， I learned from them， but I appreciate， all of them。

 right？， so， some are a little biter， but I mean， I think that one of the。

 some of the qualities that I had， was that I had a lot of respect for them， and I admired them。

 but at the same time I never viewed them as being cut from a different cloth than me。

 I think most people， you know who I work with， why they have some totally。

 bizarre impression of who I am， that I have some kind of ability that they don't。

 or they'll do the opposite， where they're so affected by the fact that I can do things that they can't do。

 that they'll try and sort of like cut it down， sort of like you know find reasons in their mind。

 why？， like you know he's got， you know he's younger than me or something like that。

 you know something ridiculous that has nothing to do with reality， most people will do that。

 they'll either cut the person down and become a hater。

 or they'll admire them and they'll become a fan， or a groupie， see I was never a hater。

 and I was never a groupie either， I was the kind of guy where it's like， I had a lot of。

 a lot of appreciation for what people have taught me。

 I was the kind of guy who if someone came out and taught me。

 even if they didn't do the best job I really appreciated it， one thing that you'll notice about me。

 is that， I say good things about just about anyone who I ever learned from。

 even if I didn't learn that much from them I will say really good things about them。

 because I opened my mind up， to whatever value they could offer me， and just sort of took it。

 and appreciated it and you know took it for what it was。

 a lot of guys have like these expectations like they want people to fix them。

 they want people to you know they want people to show them。

 you know the way of the you know the path of the light or whatever it is， and that's not realistic。

 someone that helps you is just a resource for you to use yourself， so where I was coming from。

 I was never cut from a different cloth I always believed that what one man can do。

 another man can do， so when I saw someone doing amazing， I never thought he was different than me。

 I just thought what are the actions that he took， that I could take。

 that I could follow myself to get to that path， I never it would never ever have occurred to me。

 that I couldn't do what somebody else could do， that never would have occurred to me that's just that would never have crossed my mind。

 and I always just showed you know that much appreciation and I think that。

 that because I had that appreciation， and I looked at the positive。

 it opened my mind up to see things that I think a lot of people couldn't see。

 because I remember some of the guys who I learned off of， before I went and learned off them。

 people would have a million of one excuses， oh he's tall you know he's good looking whatever it was that I have a million。

 of one excuses why they couldn't do it but I never had those excuses。

 never came up with that I was like oh yeah I could do it cool， awesome I'll figure out a way。

 most people don't do that those either they're haters or or groupies。

 don't fall into either one of those， give the respect， give the admiration。

 but don't be a groupy you know don't be like super effect just go cool man。

 great stuff I'll try and learn it， that's it， sort of a balanced perspective， um。

 also I didn't wait， you know I didn't wait to do this in reaction。

 like a lot of guys wait for a girl to dump them， and then when the girl dumps them。

 then they go out， and start trying to fix the situation by learning this。

 I think a lot of guys who come into this think that they're going to just go out for like two weeks。

 figure out how to become good with women and go fix it with their old relationship。

 they probably isn't going to work like that， you want to be proactive。

 that means having a series of habits that come together synergistically。

 to get you the outcome that you want， you don't want to just be reacting。

 you know in short-sighted reaction to every single situation as it comes up， you want to have。

 you know that series of habits， in your life， that can help you， so you come up with a plan。

 say that you decide that you're going to go out， three nights a week。

 say two or three hours a night， great， if you work， say in a place like New York。

 you there's happy hours that you could go out to， what a lot of guys do。

 you know any of you guys to use the gym， might have the experience where you're like。

 oh you know I didn't have my pre-workout meal， oh I'm tired。

 I'm not going to be able to lift as hard as I want to。

 and they'll use that as an excuse not to show up， I don't think that's good， for me， just show up。

 show up， go there， even if you're not dressed properly， even if you have a brush your teeth。

 your hair is messy， it doesn't matter， don't give yourself an excuse， if you're tired， just show up。

 except it that it's a part of your life， I think that that's probably why I've gotten to where I'm at today。

 whether it's work， school， this area， any area that I've been successful in。

 I make the choice beforehand， of what I'm going to put into it。

 and I accept that as a part of my life， there's no question， there is no possibility。

 of me avoiding， that task， it's going to happen， so when I decided。

 I mean there was a point where I decided I was going to go out seven nights a week。

 because I was living in， in Hollywood paying expensive rent to live near the club， so I said。

 if I'm going to live， in Hollywood near the clubs and pay big rent。

 I'm going to go out seven nights a week， and probably I'm not going to have a girlfriend during this time。

 I'm just going to really work on this area for this year， and I stuck to it。

 I went out seven nights a week， because I'd pre-planned it， you know on the other hand。

 different points of my life， I might go out once a week， twice a week， but I will stick to that。

 in the same way that I stick to the work that I have to do， you just accept it。

 it's a part of your life， there's no possibility of you getting out of it， that's how you'll do it。

 the number one way that guys fail to learn to become good with women is they stop。

 they don't have the habits together， to be successful at anything。

 they don't know how to learn anything， and then they try and learn this。

 but they can't because they don't have that， you know those habits of success， so point being。

 just show up， progress will be like a j-curve for you， it will be directionless at first。

 you have blind faith， you move forward you'll get it， so here's the basic steps。

 get an idea of what you want， formulate the plan of how often you need to show up to get it。

 say that you want to be， you know， solved with women， you have an idea of what you want。

 in my case I shot high， I shot very high， is that necessary？， it's not necessary。

 but have some kind of idea of what you're looking to get， and think to yourself。

 what do I have to do to get there？， do you have to do a bootcamp？。

 do you have to go out to certain number of nights per week？， do you have to change your clothes？。

 do you have to read up on confidence， and learn about your own psychology。

 so that you can build that confidence？， whatever it is。

 get that concept of what you'll have to do to get there， and decide that you will stick to it。

 except that new activity is being a part of your life， that you can't get rid of。

 you're going to show up， no matter what， what I say here， it sounds funny。

 don't worry if you're getting results， I know that sounds funny， but there was a lot of peers。

 where I did not have the best results， but I didn't worry about it。

 you want to know why I didn't worry about it？， because I had no other option。

 that's why I didn't worry about it， what how else am I going to get good with girls？。

 am I going to go sit at home and get good with girls？， no， that's not going to do anything。

 so I'll just have blind faith， and just keep working at it， and sometimes it felt rough。

 but that experience that I got， by having blind faith， made it work， and lastly。

 you have to make it into a hobby， this has to be a hobby for you， it has to be fun。

 because if you're going to do it anyway， you might as well decide that it's fun。

 and that's the decision that you make in your own mind， of what you decide to focus on。

 because if you're going to decide that this isn't fun， you're going to be miserable。

 so you've got to tell yourself， this is fun， this is my hobby， I'm going out and I'm meeting people。

 and something that you will build up， over a period of time， you guys have a lot of information。

 you want to review the information sporadically， but you don't want to be thinking about this information。

 when you go out， separate， the going out time， from the reading or watching CDs， or seminar time。

 there are two separate things， when you guys went out last night。

 what I would hope is that you're not， talking about all the stuff that you need to be doing。

 not always feel like you need to be doing something， you should just be going out there。

 and enjoying yourself， a crucial mistake that guys make all the time。

 is that they will correct each other， when they go out， they'll go out into a club。

 they'll talk about the ways that they're going to pick up girls。

 they talk about how they're going to pick up the girls， and then when they goof it up。

 they talk about the ways that they went wrong， what's that doing？。

 it's getting you into a very analytical state， it's not the place that you want to be in when you're out。

 when you're out you want to be having fun， that's what it comes down to。

 creating a good vibe within your own group， so that you have a good vibe to share。

 in the other people's groups， so remember that， so right now what I'm going to have you guys do。

 is and you guys can do this in groups of two or four， I want you guys to write down and decide。

 what your plan of action is going to be， and I want you guys to commit to it。

 you guys are going to do it， you're going to commit to each other， if you guys want to share emails。

 and see if each other has sort of commit， and be hold each other accountable， that's great。

 but you guys are going to commit to whatever path， that you're going to take for this。

 and you know what， if you don't have a lot of time， be realistic about it。

 pick something that realistically you could do， and commit to。

 so why don't you guys take five minutes， talk to each other groups two groups。

 before whatever you want， and make this commitment right now。

 to how you're going to build this into your life， all right guys， so you come up with a commitment。

 of what you're going to do， I've given you guys a pretty， pretty good， pretty broad strokes here。

 you know it's funny， because like I said， I've been testing these things。

 I've been testing the retention rates， on these seminars for years， and you know。

 sometimes I feel like I'm about to say something， and I'm like I know that I can remember that。

 and it just drives me nuts， so what I've given you guys right now。

 is what I think you're going to retain， and what I think you need to retain。

 if you guys can take what you learn here， and apply it， you will be fine。

 it will be everything you need， so what I want to talk to you guys about。

 is where you get your state from， I'm sure you guys must have noticed by now。

 that when you're in state， you feel better about yourself。

 and women respond better to you immediately， whenever you get into that zone。

 one of the really big head trips， about getting good in this area。

 is that you're constantly coming in and out of state， and we'll drive you nuts。

 because you know that when you're in state， that you're like the person that you want to be。

 you're acting in the way that you want to act， you're being the person who you want to be。

 in a lot of ways， being the person that you want to be。

 is about resisting all those external forces， that are telling you to be somebody else。

 you've got pressure from the outside world， that's telling you。

 you've got to have a certain lifestyle， you've got to act a certain way。

 you've got to you know you've got to， you know you've got to replicate what you see on television。

 the social conditioning， the social conditioning is very， very powerful。

 and this is always going through your mind， when you first learn to get good with women。

 you will find ways to put yourself in state， you will find them。

 one of the ways that you learn very quickly， is called the warm-ups， what warm-ups is。

 is you'll say the first three don't count， I'm going to go out， do my first three approaches。

 they don't count and as you get talking， if you go into state， that's one of them。

 another way that you'll find， and some of you guys who've gone out a lot， might have tried this is。

 new clothes， whenever you're wearing a brand new shirt， or you just got your haircut。

 you feel good about yourself， you kind of go into state。

 another one is like having your wingman with you， that might help you to stay in state。

 some of you guys might have noticed that when you have a girlfriend。

 women are attracted to you more often， and it's so ironic， because you're thinking yourself why。

 why when I have a girlfriend， is this happening to me， one of the things that I did。

 I really thought about this， one of the most important concepts in all this。

 is the concept of identity， as a concept， let me read to you how I would define identity for art。

 there's you know identity can have a lot of different definitions， but for our intents and purposes。

 identity is a concept in your mind， that relates you to and sets you apart。

 from your social environment， let's say that again， identity is a concept in your mind。

 that relates you to， and separates you from your social environment， alone。

 we have an understanding of ourselves， that are not contextualized。

 but in the process of interacting with others， and recognizing the differences between them and ourselves。

 we form a self concept that is more complete， so you guys see how you have a sense of who you are。

 and when you interact with other people， you get a sense of where you stand， of who you are。

 in the grand scheme of things， your identity is a presentation to yourself and to the world。

 about what makes you different or unique， and what you've learned will make people accept you。

 it is some of your beliefs about what kind of person you are， what kind of person you're not。

 what you're capable of， what you're not capable of。

 which is probably what a lot of you guys are thinking of， where you stand in the social hierarchy。

 and the ways that you're entitled to act as a result of all that。

 so let me process that mouthful for you guys， you've got this concept of who you are。

 you've got a concept of what you deserve out of life， this concept is affecting you at all times。

 I don't know if you guys know this but I went back to college this year， I went and I graduated。

 you know when I built this company， I had to leave school for a little。

 I had to leave school in my final year， and I never finished my degree so I went back to school。

 and I lived in a group with you know in a house with a bunch of guys， out of all of those guys。

 who by the way saw other RSD instructors come to the house， and bring women home every night。

 saw the girlfriend that I had， and saw everything that was going on。

 not a single one of them ever came and asked for advice， I found that very interesting。

 I know I try not to push it， sometimes I try to give a little tidbit here and there to help them out。

 but seeing a lot of those guys that I live with did not have any success with women。

 and I couldn't believe that they were not intrigued by this in any way， but the funny thing is。

 most people will never be wealthy， most people will never have hot women。

 most people will never get too far ahead in life， why is that？。

 you have a sense of what you're entitled to， when you think about the word acceptance。

 acceptance does not mean being liked， acceptance does not mean being liked。

 acceptance just means acceptance， just means no one will bother you， if you're quiet and shy。

 you probably won't get picked on that badly， if you try and elevate yourself。

 you watch what will happen， this happened to me， you will get。

 all sorts of things that will come up， especially when you're kind of not congruent with it yet。

 you're trying to be this cool guy， you're kind of not congruent with it yet， people can sense it。

 and they don't want to accept that in their reality。

 they're going to reject that out of their reality， it's tough， you look at a wolf pack。

 the alpha male wolf， has sex with all the females first， he eats the food first。

 he's got everything he wants， but why then， would the less alpha will stay in that tribe。

 they stay in that little you know they stay in that wolf pack， because it's better than leaving。

 it's better for you guys to live in society， even with no chicks no money whatever。

 than it is for you guys to， go live in the forest， like the unabomber， there's nothing。

 to be gained by doing that so you'll stay here， even if you're not getting what you want out of life。

 you'll stay， and that concept of what you deserve， will always affect that。

 now talk about something called entitlement criteria， before I go into entitlement criteria。

 I want to talk a bit more about state of what it is， your state is an emotion。

 it's an emotion like any other emotion， sadness happiness， it's an emotion that is within you。

 and exists within you at all times， the thing is in our society we're not really taught。

 to recognize it， we're not taught to recognize that emotion， because it's just not really discussed。

 the thing is it's that state that you go into， that women can sense。

 they can sense when you drop state， a woman can sense when she gives you congruence test。

 and it throws you off， and it messes with your flow and you react。

 she can see it by the way that your eyes dilate， she can see it by your voice。

 she can see it by your body language， she can see it by the types of responses。

 that you give to that test even the things that you say， that's where your state is coming from。

 you guys who go out a lot know about this state， because you know that when you're in state。

 you can drop every technique， you can drop every single little thing that you're doing。

 when you're so on， you can be out at a club， look at your girlfriend across from say， come here。

 she comes over， what's your name， she'll tell you her name。

 you just chat you could be making out with her， you could have me throwing her over your shoulder。

 within seconds， that is what it's like to be in state， it is awesome， but when you learn this stuff。

 it's this total head trip because， sometimes you've got it， and sometimes you don't got it。

 sometimes you're out of state， and you can't start a conversation to save your life。

 when you run workshops， you learn how to get over that quickly， because you have to。

 because you know， I don't think a guy who paid money is going to be too happy。

 here I'm out of state， not really going to care， just can't want to see results。

 so you learn to get over that， now let me talk about the way， different ways that people get state。

 there's different ways that people， find their state， but ultimately what state is。

 is whatever thing you think you're allowed to have， you have to think that you're allowed。

 to be in state， and that sounds funny， allowed to be in state， what does that mean， but it's true。

 if you're out with friends， you're allowed to be in state， you're allowed to dominate。

 because no one will come in and stop you， no one will come in and prevent you from doing it。

 because you feel secure to do it， here's the different， criteria that I think of。

 and depending on how your mind is wired， is going to affect your result。

 of whether or not you go in state， the first one is superficial social standards。

 superficial social standards， being money， having looks， having a nice car outside， when you see。

 society's superficial standards， and you know that you've got that， you feel great。

 you know that you've got it， so as a result of that， you have more confidence， you get more women。

 and of course guys like us see this growing up， and we think， wow man， just don't have that。

 and it further reinforces that reality， thinking that you need to have those things to get women。

 that's like superficial social standards， the next one is alliances。

 when you have guaranteed acceptance， because of who you have around you。

 or who you have in your life， if you're out with a big group of friends like last night。

 you might feel more confident than if you're on your own。

 a lot of guys have a hard time doing approaches， unless their friends are there。

 they're always looking for their wingman， their wingman dependency， that's like alliances。

 a lot of guys will find， when they have a girlfriend， women are more attracted to them。

 because they know that they've got something， so you know I watched one guy who lived in my house。

 get a girlfriend this year， and go from being a shy little guy， to being outgoing and cool。

 just because you got a girlfriend， and makes me wonder， what will happen if they break up。

 what will happen to his confidence， if they break up， I don't imagine it's going to stay but maybe。

 the next one and this is very interesting， I think you guys will find this interesting is competencies。

 have you guys ever seen a guy with a guitar， going to an iCloud before， if you've ever seen that。

 you'll see the reaction， the girls will swarm around him。

 how about if you have access to exclusive parties。

 how about if you have access to anything that people want， whenever you have something。

 that you can do for people， you'll feel more in state。

 because you know that they want something from you， so you have that anticipated acceptance。

 so your state goes up， next one， role plays， this is another interesting one。

 if you guys were to take out one of your friends after this program， and teach them how to do this。

 you probably would feel a lot more confident than if you're by yourself。

 another thing that you'll find is if you're with your wingman， and he has better skills than you do。

 it will shut your game down， you'll become a fan of what he's doing。

 you might have great skills with women， but if you're with someone who you think is better than you。

 you're going to find yourself reacting to him， you're going to find yourself trying to copy what he's doing。

 you're going to find yourself becoming a fan looking at what he's doing， all that kind of stuff。

 it doesn't work， that's a role play， if you're teaching someone on the other hand。

 then you've taken you've taken charge， so you feel like you've got that role it's the same thing as being in a teacher role。

 so that's another way that a lot of people rely on for going in state。

 but let's go back to competencies， because this is an important one。

 as a guy if you identify yourself as not being successful with women， you say。

 I'm not a guy who's successful with women， then your inclination is going to be to seek out lines routines。

 or techniques， that can allow you to take on a different identity， so that you can feel permitted。

 to have success with women， you're going to do that naturally。

 because you're going to think you're not enough， and that you need to take on something else。

 if I give you guys， an opener or a story to tell， probably you're going to go in with a lot of confidence。

 because you're going to think I've got that story that's known to work。

 it's the same thing as going in with a guitar， you've got something that you know people want from you in this case some cool story。

 so your mind says to yourself， hey dude you've got this cool story。

 if you approach people with that story， they're going to hear it， they're going to like you。

 they're going to accept you， so therefore you can feel good about yourself and you're going to go into state。

 that's how it works， when in fact if you were just in state anyway。

 you'd gotten the exact same result without that story， you'd have the identical exact same result。

 so that leads me to the final， entitlement criteria， which is the one that you have to strive for。

 that is identity， when on an identity level， you know that you deserve it。

 you know that you're entitled to it， because it's just who you are， identity level confidence。

 that is the core confidence， the core confidence， that doesn't depend on， how you look。

 having met anybody else's standards other than your own。

 it doesn't depend on who's in the venue with you， doesn't depend on if you have these cool stories。

 doesn't depend on if you've got somebody else with you that looks up to you。

 it's simply a part of who you are， that is identity level confidence core confidence。

 a guy who has core confidence， can learn how to pick up women very， very quickly。

 because all that he really needs to learn how to do， is。

 you know stuff like the plowing like just you know when you go up just keep talking。

 try and hook some attention， vibe with their get a number。

 a guy with core confidence can be taught to be good with women very quickly。

 I will have guys come on the bootcamp， who I can tell they have a strong sense of core confidence。

 and within three hours， they can do everything that I can do。

 they are awesome they're just machines， and they have an instant life style change the truth was all they really need to learn was just。

 that they're allowed to approach people， and it's cool and once they learn that， bang。

 instant life style change， on the other hand， a guy who has a situational confidence。

 not a core confidence but a situational confidence such as。

 he needs to look a certain way he needs to have friends there he needs to have a certain routine。

 stuff like that， it's going to take him a lot longer， to learn to be good with women。

 stronger effort that's what that's where I was coming from by the way。

 that's very much where I was coming from， and it's going to take him longer， because not only。

 does he have to learn the stuff that they got the core confidence has to learn。

 he has to do a complete overhaul for his entire world view， the way that he views himself。

 one of the interesting things though， when I was writing the blueprint really got me thinking。

 was why should you have core confidence， it's an interesting question。

 I mean yeah believe in yourself man you deserve it because it's who you are it's your identity， why？

 Why？ Why do you deserve， to have women？ Why should you have that？

 Why should you have that core confidence？， I think that's something that we all struggle with。

 we know that if we have core confidence that will be successful。

 but we don't see a legitimate reason， of why we should have core confidence there is。

 nothing that you can come up with it's like one this guy。

 there's this other guy next to me who has everything that I have。

 so you're seeing how you relate to that guy， you're seeing how you where you stand in relation to him。

 so you see no logical reason why you should feel， on his level or better。

 there's no logical reason for it and I really had to dig deep， to think about where that comes from。

 on one hand， you have internal validation， and on the other hand you have external validation。

 people who are externally validated， are always at the mercy， have other people respond to them。

 if you guys route last time every woman responded well。

 you probably would feel great but what if they don't。

 are you at the mercy of how they respond to you， do they dictate how you feel about yourself？。

 think if your mind is like a loop， your sense of reality， the tapestry of your reality。

 what makes up your reality？ You know the ceiling， the floor you know your mind is processing that reality。

 around you at all times， some people process their reality。

 only based on what other people think of them， they look to others to determine their reality。

 so somebody else doesn't respond well to them， they say， their mind processes it as， I suck。

 and their state follows that， their state follows the reality， because someone else says。

 you know from my identity to an identity perspective， I'm this guy， this is my identity。

 this is your identity， so stay down there in your little， fucking toolbox， place whatever。

 you're down there， I'm up here， that's that， on the other hand you've got people whose entire reality is determined internally。

 they don't really care what other people think of them。

 can anyone here think of any possible downsides to that， what would be a possible downside。

 yep that could be， absolutely， no reference for growth， absolutely you're gonna say the same thing？。

 yep， no reference for growth， you guys might know people or be like this yourself， where。

 once a guy realizes， that it's just all about only caring what he thinks。

 he feels like he's solved the game， he's figured it out。

 he's you know he's gotten behind the game he's figured it all out。

 and he gets a sort of a feeling of superiority from that， but as a result。

 he isn't motivated to do anything， he isn't motivated to get off his ass。

 and eventually the incongruence he's start to seep in。

 I'm sure you guys have met people who you know they have a strong sense of what they deserve out of life。

 you know maybe they've done like you know a lot of self-help work whatever it is but they've got you know maybe they've got it naturally。

 but they've got that strong sense of what they deserve and who they are。

 but they don't have a life that aligns with that， maybe they don't have the girl that aligns with that。

 there's nothing actually more nasty than a pickup artist， who knows how to pick up girls。

 he knows everything about it， but he really hasn't gotten those girls， that's an angry guy。

 very angry guy you'll see guys like that， they're bitter， right， and they'll have a million reasons。

 why going out is stupid and why it's all stupid all that stuff， but in truth。

 they're dealing with their own issues， so， there's a balance。

 see when you wait a think of it as like reference points， as a reference point。

 if you're an elevator if you're in a glass elevator， you can see where you are。

 you can just look outside， what if you're inside of an elevator and the lights are burnt out and it's like a regular elevator。

 you don't know where you are， so by having other people we create the context。

 through which we decide where we stand， and through that context we decide our you know our state follows suit。

 your state whether you're in state or out of state， when you go to a nightclub。

 and there's all these cool people there， and you feel like they're above you your state goes down。

 on the other hand， if you go to a club full of eighteen year olds， they're all kind of dorky。

 you might feel completely comfortable， as a result of that， a guy with core confidence。

 does not predicate his sense of reality， on something external。

 he does not predicate his sense you know his sense of reality is not predicated。

 based on the other people around him， it's just a part of who he is。

 so let's go back to what I said why， why should you， have core confidence。

 well something kind of scary that I realize is that， it's very possible that you shouldn't。

 because if you're not living your life the way that you want to live your life。

 if you're living your life in a reaction， and you're living your life in a shit way。

 probably you shouldn't have core confidence， so I really thought about this。

 when you think about the when you think about looks。

 certain women that are good looking have you guys seen how the standard of beauty。

 has changed for women in the past thirty forty years， you guys know what I'm talking about。

 you know the standard of beauty thirty forty years ago， was women who were more curvy。

 I have a theory， I don't know if this is completely nonsense but I have a theory。

 that the reason why the skinny skinny women are so popular these days， is because of fake breasts。

 because back in the day if a woman was really skinny she probably would have very small breasts。

 so I wouldn't like that but since fake breasts came out most women like in playboy。

 are like these skinny little girls that were probably flat as a little boy。

 slap some fake teeth on that they look awesome， right so that's the thing is that。

 you're seeing the standard of beauty is changing， how about the standard of looks how about for guys。

 the standard of looks is moving more towards this like， this like Eastern European male model look。

 that was not the standard of beauty， thirty or forty years ago for a man。

 it's different the standard is always changing， the standard of beauty is not necessarily what's genetically superior。

 is it， because what's genetically superior in terms of like， you know maybe strength or symmetry。

 might not be what social conditioning has dictated is popular at that time。

 genetics superiority is not necessarily dictated by， the quality of the gene， so much as。

 the likelihood that gene will reproduce， a tan for example is not necessarily healthy。

 getting a tan can sometimes be unhealthy but， it's considered sexy。

 so therefore that's a certain social center that's there， three hundred years ago if you had a tan。

 that meant that you worked out in the fields， so the standard changed。

 these are all standards that we have， the thing is you can dictate your own standard。

 it comes down to whether or not your frame is strong enough。

 people are always doing something called social， pinging， social pinging。

 is an unconscious process that's going on at all times。

 we're constantly looking out into the world and seeing what is normal， what is the norm。

 if you guys have ever heard a culture shock， that is when you go somewhere where the norm is so upside down。

 that you literally your sense of reality is just flipped out， it's just flipped out because。

 your whole social pinging system is being thrown out a whack。

 when you have what's called a strong frame， which is a strong interpretation of reality。

 you guys don't you guys don't get what a frame is， it's like the window。

 through which you look at reality， when you have a strong frame， people when they socially ping you。

 can sense your belief， in who you are what you're doing， the way you're acting， etc etc。

 this is why if a girl tests you， and you show no reaction to it， she thinks you're cool。

 remember that in any social interaction， there is always one person。

 reacting more to the other person， than that person is reacting to them， let's say that again。

 it's important， in any social interaction， there is always one person reacting more to the other person。

 than that person is reacting to them， if you're talking to a woman， she might be reacting to you。

 more than you're reacting to her， or you might be reacting to her more。

 whoever is reacting to the other person more， probably has the lower social value。

 as probably less attractive to the other person， this is why when you're in state。

 if you've ever been out in state， you are so indifferent to how the woman reacts。

 she can feel that off of you， she can feel that vibe off of you， she can feel it in your pupil。

 she can feel it in your voice， she can sense that you're not reacting。

 and when you can sense that person， is not reacting to you in any way。

 it draws you into their frame， it draws you to take on their belief systems。

 because remember that people are always paying for what， certainty。

 people are always looking to see， who is more certain of their reality。

 and whoever has the most certain sense of reality。

 is the person who probably has the most influence， on the group's opinion， think about rock groups。

 that dress in the most ridiculous clothing， or rappers， look how rappers。

 just by stylizing their image of growing up in the ghetto， have got entire countries of white kids。

 like where I come from in Canada， dressing like little ghetto kids， they want to be like that。

 this is what people who change culture do， people who are trendsetters， have a style。

 or have an identity that is unique， and that a lot of people would think is ridiculous。

 but because they have such a strong frame about， they're so certain about it。

 and they stylize it with humor， cool stuff， fun things， maybe good music， they stylize it。

 with that， and it becomes cool， so this is what I was thinking about in terms of the word authenticity。

 the word authenticity， see when you approach a woman， your mind is looping。

 your mind is saying where do you stand？， if your standards， of what is good and what is not good。

 is dictated by television， chances are most of us in this room。

 are not going to live up to that standard， because we're deciding to buy into the standard of television。

 but what is TV all about？， we live in a capitalist society， we're in Manhattan right here。

 we're in a capitalist society， what is advertising's goal？， advertising's goal。

 is to make you paranoid， that you don't have enough to buy their products， and I don't blame them。

 they need to call to action， they need to get you off your ass。

 if you don't have some kind of emotional reason， to buy their product， you're not going to buy it。

 so， what advertising does， is to say you're not good enough， you need these products。

 and you need to look like these people， these models in our products， and of course you don't。

 but you can try to look like them， but you never will probably， you can come close to it。

 probably never will， to me the guys that get girls， are the guys that have their own style。

 their own way of interacting， and they don't try to live up to other people's standards。

 they draw other people into it， let's say that I'm going to go do an interview on the media。

 say that before I go in there， I start thinking to myself， what are they going to ask me？。

 and I think， can I get the approval， and I start thinking that beforehand， if I do that。

 and I try to come up with all these perfect little answers for them。

 that I think will meet their standard， will I ever win？， what do you think？。

 no because they have a pre-judge， a opinion of me， already going in。

 and it doesn't matter what I think about， I'm not going to win that one， it's just not going to fly。

 what if I go in there， irrelevant to what they think， and when I get on there。

 I talk about what I'm passionate about， and what I'm focused on。

 and if they try to throw these weird questions at me， I'm just， anyway。

 go back on what I'm passionate about what I'm focused on， in that case， they will be drawn in。

 it's amazing how， you know I remember， I remember doing a speech once， about， inner game。

 and it was a very basic speech， and the guy who had just gone right before me。

 had just spoken about a lot of fantastic techniques， and these were amazing techniques。

 but because I spoke powerfully that day， he started to feel as if his techniques were ridiculous。

 and started saying to me， you know sort of qualifying himself to me， and I remember thinking。

 I really thought his speech was better， I thought that his speech was more interesting than mine。

 but because of the fact， that I had more conviction of what I was saying on that particular day。

 that's how he felt， it's that same thing is when you go out with someone。

 who you feel like they're better at picking up girls than you are。

 and you lose your confidence in the way that you pick up girls， you start trying to play their game。

 that's what always happens， whenever I go out with somebody， just because， I run RSD。

 I think people have like a certain preconception of me。

 and what I'll always say to them is play your own game， don't try to play my game。

 don't even watch what I'm doing， play your own game， don't get caught up with what I'm doing。

 a lot of the time I'll even try to lay back， and let them sort of build up some steam。

 so I can get the best out of them， because if they start trying to play my game。

 it's not going to work， they're not going to catch up to that， see so that's what it comes down to。

 is playing your own game， the word that I use here is authenticity。

 when you're approaching that woman， what most guys are thinking is。

 how have the women reacted to me tonight， how am I dressed， am I good enough， they're thinking that。

 your brain has to be rewired to focus on identity， I'm entitled to this because of my identity。

 because of who I am， because I am real， you have to have your own set of standards。

 for what you want out of life， and live that standard， that is what it's about。

 you have your own passions， your own things that you love。

 your own things that you respect and admire， and you have to do them。

 that's what we call self-actualization， you know who you are。

 you know that you've done the things that are good。

 you know that people have only had good experiences with you， so why should you ever think about。

 what they think， you have no reason to think that， when I think about， what it means to be cool。

 you know， and then the word congruence， it's an interesting distinction to me。

 you guys all heard the word congruence， you guys have heard it， you guys have heard it， guys right。

 I need a little bit of feedback here， alright so， you guys have heard that。

 you guys have heard of the word cool， of course， but how do you define a word like cool。

 what does it mean to be cool， any thoughts， any thoughts on that guys， what does it mean to be cool。

 use that word all the time， suggestions， self-confidence within yourself。

 self-confidence within yourself， sure， absolutely， confidence is standout， confidence is standout。

 definitely， yeah， on what， on flappability， yeah， you're not flappable， okay， that's cool。

 so it means unreactive I guess， yeah， so， you know too， strength， sure， okay， definitely。

 you know to be there's two different things， there's congruence， and then there's being cool。

 and I think they're different concepts， I think that they're， distinct concepts， congruence to me。

 is when you have sort of found an alignment， in your role in society， and you yourself。

 are in mentally in alignment with it， have you guys ever known someone who。

 you know he wasn't that compelling， maybe he's kind of boring， but he was comfortable with that。

 you guys know anyone like that， because there's you know there's different kind of things going on here。

 you can take a guy who's not that good with women， but he's very unreactive。

 he never qualifies himself， you know he's not trying to oppress anybody。

 but he's just not that good with women， why is he not that good with women。

 because he doesn't really stand out， there's nothing that stands out about him， he's a generic。

 and he's a conformist， he doesn't have that high sense of who he is， then you've got other guys。

 I'd say this was probably more what I was for a long time， who stand out a lot。

 and have that sense of who they are， but they're not in alignment with it yet。

 they haven't really come to believe it， I think a lot of guys that learn this game。

 that's what they are too， it's like you know you learn how to be funny。

 you learn how to you know bus balls， how to stand out， how to dress interesting。

 but you don't believe it yet， you don't you're not congruent to it yet。

 you know if I were to look back at， at my path to you know become a good with women。

 I think about all the things that I tried to do at first， you know I tried to get you know。

 you know my house car， education money clothes， all that kind of stuff， and I had this stuff。

 but I wasn't in alignment with it， I wasn't congruent to it， if I talk to a girl。

 it wasn't enough that I had this stuff， I would try to talk about it， I would try to bring it up。

 the thing is， it came across that I was not in alignment with that， a guy who has that stuff。

 does not need to bring that up，得罪了，这些不不干，他们想要，对罪，意见，F spaces，是，谪，U，年齡就能向 안發言，及當跟 solid 成，國家的控制，制室。

 Knowing whether you can come up with some，但真的，我們市民這個心裡，我們本來不決定，建議ū that，我並不在，我還沒見到，我 shelters，翻查，我說。

 told，後來，沒有，ou，okay，hh，好，value giver， Isn't that interesting？， The idea of giving value。

 because that's a little bit counterintuitive， The idea of giving value， Well。

 isn't that like buying drinks， or buying dinners， or giving money， That's giving value。

 or maybe like being almost like a clown， You know， giving value。

 But that's not what giving value is about， Those things that I just mentioned are taking value。

 Because when you do those things， you're doing it to get， people to be indebted to you。

 or you're doing it to get a reaction， to pump your own state， As soon as a woman can tell。

 that you're doing something， to get a reaction from her， to pump your own state， ceases to work。

 useless， She loses attraction， So to me， giving a person who's a value giver。

 means someone who offers value， not with favors， not with， you know， entertainment。

 but someone who offers value by their presence， and their individuality。

 So let me tie that back in with what I was saying， I talked about authenticity， being real。

 what that means， what that means to really be like， just transparently real。

 and to have developed your own individuality， on a very deep level， If you guys look at guys like。

 Axel Rose， or somebody like that， who are just so， they're so creative， that you know。

 got like two packs of core， or biggie smalls， they have that， they have their own style。

 and they're not following any commercial formula， they're not following a tried and tested business model。

 they're setting trends， they're changing culture， because they're taking what they do。

 and they're going to a place so deep inside of themselves， to find what's so real to them。

 and they're bringing it out of themselves， with so much emotion， and power and realness behind it。

 so raw， the people just feel that energy， and they want a piece of it for themselves。

 and that's what sells like， millions of records， and changes culture， because they're doing that。

 and a lot of ways， that's what being a pickup artist is about。

 it's like you've got these pressures on you， to impress， to meet other people's standards。

 and they're pulling at you， and they're pulling at your mind。

 and when you can just get down to a place， like so， find out like。

 you know who you are on such a deep level， you know who you are， you know what's real to you。

 you understand， that nothing is a threat to you， and because you understand that nothing is a threat to you。

 you can bring that side out of yourself， you know from a very deep place。

 that is what gets you girls， that is when you can just walk up to a girl， and you can talk to her。

 bang， she sucked in， she threw on into it immediately， she's qualifying herself to you。

 she wants to know more about you， that's what that's about， you know being an artist。

 like that's a tough job， anyone who's done anything creative， it's a hard job。

 it's like torture in a lot of ways， it's like a love-hate relationship， with yourself。

 and with your art， because when you're an artist， it's almost like， being a pickup artist。

 where you're always trying to go into state， but as an artist， you're trying to get into that zone。

 you're trying to get into that creative spot， in your mind， but it's so hard to get at。

 because you've got all these pressures， to be something you're not。

 to you know to copy what other people are doing， these pressures that are pushing at you。

 and you have to push through that， and get to that place， so down like so， far down inside。

 inside yourself， the realest place inside of you， to be able to bring that out， and to almost like。

 capture it， whether it's in a song， or you know a drawing， whatever it is， acting。

 that's what being an artist is about， and that's what being a pickup artist is， it's like。

 you've been in state， you know you've had， that glimpse， of who you want to be， that's what。

 Brad Pitt， Tyler Durin， the movie Fight Club， he says， self-improvement， is masturbation， he's like。

 well we're after his self-destruction， that is getting somewhere， and it's like。

 you guys have this identity， this concept of who you are， you've got your rationalizations。

 your blind spots， you've got blind spots， to all these different things， your reasons， your story。

 for who you， for why you are， who you are， you've got this story， of why you are the person you are。

 and for me， I had this story， I had these blind spots， these rationalizations， and I had to。

 I had to look， I had to look， past them， I had to say， screw it， screw my car identity。

 forget my car identity， just scrap it， my style， the way that I act， you know my opinions on things。

 I just let them go， I shove them aside， and I said I'm like a blank slate。

 that's what we talk about， self-destruction， you know in the movie Fight Club。

 he's so attached to his， like his IKEA furniture， you know he's like， he can， what could define him。

 if you got the perfect， clothes of perfect furniture， he could be defined by that。

 and he just scrap it， because he understood， that in a commercial society。

 that that is just buying it， to somebody else's frame， it's not real， and you'll die， unsatisfied。

 I think most people in today's society， die， very unsatisfied， our society has a tremendous。

 fear of death， tremendous fear of death， in our society， because people don't feel。

 as if they have lived， people don't feel like， they have lived their lives。

 they feel like they have， bought into the lives， of other people， they feel like they have bought。

 into the lives of other people， that other people， have， have dictated to， them， it's become。

 emotional topic for me， yeah， you know， I guess just getting out of that， like having the balls。

 you know to see， it's kind of very， very important topic for me， having that concept of who you are。

 and having the balls， to run with it， like you know who you want to be。

 and having the balls to run with it， it's just such a powerful thing， because that's the thing。

 when you guys go out， I see you guys， I work with you guys， every weekend， these guys that come in。

 every weekend， and they're so， they're so like pressured， you know， they're reacting。

 they're reacting to， what the girls think about them， and they're reacting to。

 all these different pressures， and they're like， and you just want to get。

 you want to pull them out of it， you just want to shake them， out of it， you know。

 if you can shake them out of that， and just get them， get that out of their heads。

 and get them in touch， with who they are， get them to find that sense of， individuality， you know。

 you can change your lives， you can change it， permanently， and set them on a different path。

 come。
