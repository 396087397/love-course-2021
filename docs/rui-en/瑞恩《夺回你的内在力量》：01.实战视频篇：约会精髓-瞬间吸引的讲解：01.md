# 瑞恩《夺回你的内在力量》：01.实战视频篇：约会精髓-瞬间吸引的讲解：01

在今天的影片我會 show you guys one tip that is gonna help you pull the girl from wherever you are。

 bats you place or your sex location，嗯， some are relaxing and hang out some are chill better than a dark alley。

哈哈， unless you prefer that，哈啰，你不想要的，哈啰，你不想要的，你不想要的，哈啰，那是怎樣，许多了吧，就走起柔修捕，收到 factors，用攻擊 1992在唐不正面開始。

從那坨的廢門方向，直上變化自己接近攻擊，換變難的玩家，假如攻擊� Wednesday，我當然希望一切事願，但便能就是說，得comes Mack who travels to that house。

他去住心这些情绪，不知道要爱歐学，吗，因为他只会爱一发，他 easier for you，运発，再见，他挺喜欢夜半，你对你对你对我觉醒。

 make something and what you're gonna do， So， you kinda have to say things。

 you kinda take the responsibility of her， Giving her that plausible rejectability， Okay。

 so for example if a girl asks me， as I'm pulling her back to your place， if she's like， oh。

 where are we going？， um， I usually just say， somewhere magical， somewhere chill。

 somewhere easy to hang out， okay， so she's somewhere along those lines， and then changed to topic。

 and simply just meet her there， Okay， and when girls comfortable enough with you。

 For a girl to go home with you，你不想跟他一起，你真的需要你，你能与你相同的，也能与你相同的，也能与你相同的。

所以 once you've already been through，you know those stages，now you're ready to pull it home。

and you know，and you should， the whole pull sequence， the main thing is， simply lead， and don't。

 put the responsibility on her， or don't make it obvious， that， you know， like。

 oh we're going back to my place， and fuck， because obviously she's not going to do that。

 she's not going to be， you know， compliant， she's not going to give you compliance， if you word it。

 or frame it like that， but if you simply just， you know， be a little bit elusive， about it。

 be a little bit， mysterious about it， you know， things like， oh yeah， we're going to， you know。

 hang out at a cool place， or I'm going to show you something really cool， really awesome。

 and just come， and then change the topic， you know， keep her engaged， as you're walking。

 so there's really no， any you know， awkward silences， where her logic， might kick in， and be like。

 where we going， and like， and obviously if she likes you， like she wants， to have sex， with you。

 but she doesn't， also at the same time， doesn't want to feel， just too easy。

 or she doesn't want to feel， like a slut， so it is up to， your responsibility， is up to you。

 to you know， kind of take that， off of her， and make it happen， and walk with her， lead her。

 to your place， which is how to， close once you get， to your place， okay， so number one。

 you want to set up， your place for the poll， okay， which means you want to have your place。

 as clean as possible， and you don't have， garbage and， you know， random shit laying around。

 that really， stink up your room， okay， or stink up your place， and on top of that， you know。

 especially the way you set up your place， you kind of want to have， you know， a lot of， lights。

 where it's like， dimmed， okay， you want to have your， lights dimmed。

 you don't want to have too many lights， you don't want to have very bright lights， so let's see。

 if you're back from a nightclub， you don't want the moment you enter， your house， it's like， boom。

 fucking light hits your， in the face， okay， you don't want that， you want them to come in。

 where as they enter your house， it's kind of like， very soft， and ambien light， okay。

 because the whole idea， of them entering your place， is they have to be comfortable。

 and that's your main focus， so once they've entered your place， don't ever jump on the girl。

 like right away， don't just jump on her， and start like， face raping her， and like， you know。

 humping the girl， literally， you know， let her get comfortable， with your place， you know。

 sit on the couch， maybe make her drink， and， put on some music， or， put something on TV， or YouTube。

 or whatever it is， it's something， entertaining and distracting， and once you've done that。

 you can basically just chill， have a drink with her， and slowly escalate the vibe。

 the main thing is， all about her being comfortable， this entire time， and there's a couple of signs。

 like for example， if a girl comes to my place， and the first thing she does， is let's say。

 take off her jacket， take off her shoes， and you know， throw it up， to me， that gesture shows。

 that she's really comfortable， at my place， she's really comfortable， being alone with me。

 so usually girls， who take off， take off their jacket， take off their shoes。

 I usually don't get a lot of resistance， or any resistance at all， closing them。

 but if you think a girl， who comes in， and you know say for example， she's got her jacket on。

 she's got her back pack on， and everything's on， she comes in， sits on your couch， and she's like。

 arms crossed， so in which case， she's a little bit defensive， shows that she's not very comfortable。

 and that if you try to close now， you're probably going to get a lot of resistance。

 okay so the key there， is to basically， let her be comfortable in your place。

 let her check out your place， let her explore your place a little bit， you know maybe looking at。

 your bookshelf， okay maybe watching something on TV， whatever music you've got。

 or even play some sort of video games， or board games that are laying around。

 just kind of like spend some time in your place， it's almost like， another location。

 where you guys are hanging out， okay， and then eventually， you want a leader to say， the bedroom。

 okay so this is actually my room， it's the place that I'm staying at at the moment。

 and as you can see， it's quite small， I've got windows on this side。

 and a massive curtain on this side， that blocks of my room， to the other room。

 so it's basically a solarium， okay so basically， this is kind of like， where the magic happens。

 and I'm basically living in the， solarium at the moment， okay now for you， if you've got a big room。

 right， but if you've got like， a closet， or some sort of you know， solarium or whatever。

 small den that you're living in， kind of like me， it's not the end of the world。

 okay like you can still， close even if it's， in a solarium， or a den like this。

 as long as you have a bed， it's comfortable， and your comfortable， and everything's all good。

 okay if you act like， if you bring a girl home， and you're the one who starts to say， panic。

 and start acting like， oh my fucking god， like my place is like， messy， you know it's so small。

 like what you're going to think about this， what you're going to think about that。

 if you start thinking that way， you're going to start freaking out。

 you know as a girl comes in your house， which completely kills her comfort。

 and you're not going to be able to close， so， so， so。
