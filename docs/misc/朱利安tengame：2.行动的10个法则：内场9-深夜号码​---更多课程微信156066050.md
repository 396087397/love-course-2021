 it's easier，No，Brenny Donovan，Yeah， like everyone born in the 80s，Like Brittany Cooper，Yeah。

But all of our moms thought they were created by adding our subtraction，Are you from San Diego？，No。

Where？，New York，New York，Jersey？，Are New York？，Oh Jersey，He has to buy some shirts，Now。

 a couple of little subtleties here，No serencing him and me，He's very jump red，OK，He jumps，Well。

 not just at the end but all throughout，It's like，Why is it that every time I say something。

 Her attention goes off him towards me，So I walk up，Brenny's spirit，Brenny's spirit is away。

That's how she might cousin，That's how fortunate，Because I fucking hate her for ruining my name。

So starting now，Brenny， your name？，Brenny Murphy，Why is she look at me，Brenny Murphy。

He's got a good name to her， Cause I'm giving he's taking，Like Brittany Murphy，Like this，Like that。

Like this， Him，I get that a lot too，She's good though，She's good though right，She's good，Give me。

She's good，Like Brittany Donovan，BOOM，On me，Like Brittany Donovan，Brenny Donovan，Yeah。

 like everyone born in the 80s，Like Brittany Cooper，Yeah。

But all of her moms thought they were created by adding her with subtracting，Are you from San Diego？。

No，Where？，New York，New York，He's like，Oh， aren't like taking，Needing her to acknowledge him。

Can't be at ease without it，I couldn't even tell he was trying to talk to her until you pointed it out。

I thought he was talking to the middle of something，Yeah， Cause it's not engaging，Yeah。

 it's like bomb， it's like，Psh， on the sidelines，Like hey， like that，Don't even exist，Pear's through。

Oh， Jersey，And even that little challenge，Like， oh， Jersey，Yeah， I think I was from Jersey。

Where do you think the others like to take her out to？，Yeah， I will hug you when I make the move。

I don't know， I can see，Nice to meet you by the way，Let's jump on the middle girl， wing him。

So I'm like， oh nice to meet you on the front，I know，I'm trying to look nicer on the shirt。

It's not mine，Check this out，I'm trying to look nicer with the shirt，It's not mine。

So I don't take anything，I don't ask anything，I'm like， whatever is the inside joke with myself。

So I'm wearing this pink shirt，It's like， nice to meet you，I'm trying to look nicer with the shirt。

So I always check this out， Best type of open，Oh， wait， or hit on me today，A guy。

I'm getting horrible，Who is the experience？，I'm getting angry，I'm not confident with my sexuality。

I'm confused，I'm lost and confused，I don't know what's happening，I don't know what's happening。

I just see，Oh， you are from Jersey，I'm from the shore，I was in the shore，My hand was in the shore。

I was in the background，You can put it on my hand，and it's one scene，I'm from the shore。

I'm from the shore，You have a body，Why would that be bad if I put it on my face，No。

 you can't put it on my face，I'm just gonna put it on my face，I'm nervous，Oh， you didn't kill anyone。

But I can put the camera on my face，I'm pressing your fingers，IT'S OK，Come closer。

 It's cool in talking，But somebody being yell，I am emotional，Pull her， But your group，会信。

I never feel a starting notation，Just me，You look just like his，I don't know。

This is pretty q and making herself feel good，好啊，你聽我唐寰，那是假一直驚訝，吃啤酒，吃啤酒，OK，你心想要做描述，像公会， regeneration。

就是，你一个老公，很好，但是我会想，感觉，你老闻，齐男，你爱你，我很很感应，你知道吗，能不能，就是这个OMG，她喂町， Really can，我竟然有请 stones，に好，我喜欢，我的意思，是这个。

展示能力螈接，但看來在一起，尤其是，放滑，就空氣，較 Slowly，Viony， peril，V sich，符號，對，我爹，免得，必頓，免得，狀態，放滑，等於，這才閃爬，等於，就語言，是，每時。

ball，R， Eng， R，感覺，把カット拔剖la，然後把背部剁進去，斜，你要不要踢，同時會變更換，雜作，該票調對了，那是不太好，不太好，Tod。

 Here's what he finds is good as me talking about this， being very technical。。

 The reason being so technical works for Todd is that that's what makes him feel this way。， For me。

 if I get like two technical， it just kind of kills it。 I just want more freedom for him。

 that's what turns him on。， So I'd say， yeah， I got like Todd， that'd be the furthest out。。

 Some guys， one thing I don't ever do is dance， and never dance with a girl。。

 Some guys find it really， they feel really good dancing。 They do that。

 or they break the girl into dance world for a little while。， So stuff like that， yeah。

 Those would be like two more contrast examples。， And Jeffy， like what is it？。

 Jeffy is very similar to me， actually， yeah。 We kind of go， if we game together， like Jeffy， for me。

 the ones that are most similar to me， would be Jeffy and Brad。， For fun， too。

 it's like any kind of inside joke。 A good example for that is， you know。

 one thing I would make sometimes like clients do back in the day is。

 there was like a challenge to see how many times they could slip in like a dog without the girl noticing。

， So it's like， so hey， how's it going？ What's your name？ She's like Jessica。 They're like， oh。

 that's cool， like a dog。 What do you do？， Like， what do you say？ Nothing like a dog。

 Like something like that。 You know， like that inside joke。 It's like that kind of sparks it up。。

 You could even like find it funny to go boring。 You know， it's like， here you go。

 It's like see how boring you can get。 And then you can find it amusing that the girl is even listening to something so boring。

， And then that makes it fun。 And that makes it even interesting to her。。

 So there's all these different ways like the possibilities are endless。 And you know。

 what you'll notice too is like the more you go out， the more you like fine tune your unique style。

 But then also the more you go out， you may start getting a little bit more bored of some stuff。。

 So you may have to start slowly and be getting it。 So it's continuously evolving too。 You know。

 like that open where I found it funny at the time be like， oh my god。 Oh， hey。

 I kind of grew past that。 So it kind of still changes every few months。。

 And sometimes I'll go back to it if you haven't touched on it in a while。 Then it's exciting again。

 But yeah， those are some examples。， Yeah， for me， I like stretching it。

 Whatever I can do to stretch things or make it awkward。 She's like， how old are you？ I'm like。

 go on 38。 Like straight face。 She's like， what？ I'm 18。 Straight face。 You know， or like， yeah。

 I'm 38。 My daughter is at the bar。 She's 21。 So birthday seriously。 I'm like， yeah。

 what are you saying？ It's Botox。 You'll learn about it when you're older。， She's not like that。

 It's so out there that it's not believable yet the way I say it makes it sound believable。

 And that kind of like， is he fucking with me or not？ Like writing that edge， I find that hilarious。。

 And this is pretty key to with what you find funny。

 Like the more you can find the themes behind what you do the better。。

 So instead of having specific lines or specific things you say or actions， find the themes。。

 You're doing it like you're more whatever。 You kind of like get numb to the sense of you're going on every day because you're like。

 all here's another fucking set。 But I noticed that sometimes if you like take a time off to kind of like。

 And the like， I would say like， if you go off five days a week。

 you cannot get recenter or you reflect on your game。

 I actually like feel more like passionate about going out more because more excited。， Maybe yeah。

 I'd say。 You don't necessarily have to cut off the door now， but like taking breaks。

 nothing wrong with it。 But I would say is like， change what those 30 minutes mean to you。

 If it's like 30 minutes of like， let's do this and plow through。， Then that's pretty bad for me。

 30 minutes is like even casual like I'll split it out throughout the day。。

 So matter the grocery store， hey， what's up？ How's it going？ There's like five minutes。

 Then later in the day， what's up？ I said， five minutes。 Then I do a date。 I can't for the rest。

 Dates count as well。 It's like just viewed as like 30 minutes， ideally。， Or not。

 you don't have to say 30 minutes。 Just like ideally， make it a part of your life。

 The you're a guy who just interacts with girls。， It's more like that versus game time。 Go。

 Because that'll kind of burn you out。 It's like it's a chore then。， So I'd say do that。

 And then it's not so much you getting numb to the sets。 Because if you're getting them to the sets。

 it's still a byproduct of you trying to take。， For me。

 it's like those 30 minutes or interacting with girls is like， fucking fun。

 Because that's me expressing who I am。， You can never get bored of expressing who you are。

 That's makes you feel good。 It's like， fuck yeah。， When I was in life， can you do that？

 I'd grow bored if I couldn't do that。 If I'm just stuck in my like a job all day。

 and then I just go home and go through those same old motions。

 and I can't put myself out there and share and give， that's what made me grow bored and unhappy。。

 The going out should be like， fuck it。， But that's also something you build up to。

 It's like fucking working out。 For a lot of guys， including me in the past， I can say。

 here we go to the gym， plow through versus fuck yeah。

 let's go exert some energy instead of being all complacent。 Let's do it。。

 I do a lot of frontline talk and not not the nights and teasing。 So I'm like trying to。

 how would I physically like actually consciously put my effort on it and work on it？。

 Write it on your arm。 Like for real。 It's basically you just need to remind yourself a lot。

 If you had someone，， in terms of like revisiting the conversation， oh， this is what I said。

 This is boring。 But how could I like reinterpret the，， I wouldn't， like again。

 I wouldn't do those recordings because it's like it'll give you two focus on every little detail and you'll have zero float your interactions。

， I would like to just focus on the main lessons from all sets。 And then it's like if you got to fix。

 for example， being less flatlined， you know， ideally it should come from getting out of your own way。

 but you can also just act as if。， How do you act as if anyone can talk louder。

 anyone can be less flatlined， but you get into old habits。

 So you just need something to constantly remind you to not be flatlined。。

 Thus writing it on your arm。 Hello， oh yeah， hello， oh yeah。

 and then time and awareness will fix it。 It's like breaking reports onality。

 You guys can all talk breaking rapport except that every time you go out。

 the habit is hello to the girl。， The habit takes over。 If every time it's written down on your arm。

 break rapport， break rapport， break rapport， you'll get good。， Whatever your big sticking point is。

 you'd want to like some kind of reminder throughout the night。 A lot of this is time and awareness。

 If you're not man to woman， you keep holding that back。， Man to woman。 Oh yeah， man to woman。

 Man to woman。 Play to win。 Think logistics， logistics。 Oh yeah， logistics。 Oh yeah。

 you need reminders all the time。 Like that writing on your arm is like crucial。。

 It'll like cut out cut off like tons off your running curve。 So once again。

 it's like bring her in with the fun。 And usually I'll do that too。 Like that's the 90， 10， 90% here。

 Me expressing real or in 10。 So anyway， what do you do？ Then I'll still keep the fun a bit。

 but slow down。， No， she is。 How about a friend in college？ I work with me。 Hold her。， I know。

 How did I know？， 28。 But it's 30。 That's so sad。， That's so sad。， I was going to say 30 something。

 I'm kidding。 I'm kidding。 I'm kidding。 How do you think I have a girlfriend？， I'm 10 now。 Older。

 better， more mature， smarter。 I think I'm getting what's got to have some to like work。。

 I'm so sorry。 Don't work out like the name of every great man in America。 My mom gave me George。

 What are you guys doing right now？， I'm for food at Burger Lounge。 So it's like chat。

 What are you doing right now？ Don't just hope for something magically happen。 Come to Burger Lounge。

， Right。 Nice。 Ever。 Burger Lounge。 So mean to me。 What the fuck？ What the fuck did I do？。

 I'll put you on the fucking track。 We'll step up。 I am from Switzerland though。， True story。

 For real。 Why don't you believe me？ I'm born and raised。 I moved to you three years ago。。

 You're going to ask that。 You cannot have lost your ass。， My mom's American。

 And two almost like beat the shit out of each other。 There's a noxious。 Beak for my number。。

 Can you beak for it？ And I'll let you on Facebook。 Beak。， Say please。 Okay， okay， okay。

 What's your phone number？， How are you doing？ And then when you give it back to me， like say here。

 master。， I'm kidding， I'm kidding。 You're too intimidating。。

 I'm just some loser to pink shirt with some necklace。， It's been nice and cute。 It was。， Okay。

 just simple。 So I got a fun， fun， fun。 Logistics unfortunately didn't happen。， So it's like。

 I would ever go for the number。 That's it。 Fun。 Balance bang。
