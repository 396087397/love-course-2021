現在是今天上次上次的跳舞，請向知名角度拍攝，我只iga十一版目前，我最重要的要來跟大家講問，我們我是塑劇時，那位年輕人就熱情的角度，但是歡迎优惊就講，身高的角度，所以各位やって一下，說不太是。

資源 pouring，料 跟拿艺教系，發展 are 結合，他有彧歐功練，他的電話，你要去巴時，他有一種高隱，超棒非常地高，因為他的伏電，超遠達12元。

 especially multiple relations with women all the same time is pretty outstanding， So Jeff。。。。

 I'd like to talk to you about a little bit about how you are able to successfully manage multiple women at the same time。

 through long term relationships not even just short term but long term。

 Well I guess the answer to that would be evidently I am fucking not。

 because my girlfriend dumped my fucking ass a couple of months ago。

 I don't know how many days or anything like that 105，但你不希望，但如果你想，但我覺得這個分析，我跟那婆婆，才會遊戲 Honestly。

如果你有社會影片，他們沒有遇到那樣可以，但基於我問X，我把XX，好 IIH Us，雖然好像失關的，跟其不申請，但，Sic，你可以給難的重新提及，但是讀書他制定，，過去的話其他的推控。

 Hispanic speak，我認為，每個事情的事件，是在 some way your fucking fault，在 some small way，是 your fault。

所以 rather than like， get angry， get bitter， and try to look for the fault of other people。

 because that's like the easiest thing to do， right？ gravitate towards how they fucked up。

 you gotta look internally and see， what mistakes you make， don't beat yourself up over it。

 move forward in a positive direction， you know i haven't really even talked about this。

 you're like the first person i've talked about this on camera with， it's just like over time。

 in a relationship， you gotta really avoid， situations where。

 it gets heated to the point where you say things， that， even once it's worn off。

 it's always going to linger， because the woman remembers everything you'll ever fucking say。

 at least every bad thing， and like four months later，我看一看，若于我这些东西，连继续被攻擊，因为这身工作力与我，我们这首集使用具处有关事，。

走高的案例，最绚连在维密から，我们不怀疑，而也是同学，这不是小学，刚刚事 Huawei Project，我相信，我簡直配合粉絲monogamy，令人讓我出招，自己明白好，怎麼會買呢，我像可是聽起來。

我作為讓人煥煔，我知道放了回來，在所有社交人員之上，想說不要為人家，你沒有必理怎麼樣，ou can open relationship namanagos relationship whatever you want to call it。

there is a couple things，number one is being， willing to， revisit the rules periodically。

and being open to having discussions about that not an unneeded reaction way either，and。

 again being open to that，and then secondly and this is honestly，這是最重要的事件，最重要的事件，然後它會覺得很凶，但是它是最重要的事件。

是，恢復了，的狀態，而恢復了，鑑林牙齿，是你鑑林的狀態，因為，我之前有過過的，我剛才提到的，是一種，的反應，鑑林的狀態，在鎖定，或在鎖定，所以，第1，你需要把鑑林放在鎖定上，第2。

你需要把鑑林的狀態放在鎖定上，現在這件鎖定是很簡單的，是這件鎖定？，對，是你，把鑑林的狀態放在鎖定上，對，我跟你們在一起，我認為，你能夠看見這件鎖定，這件鎖定是很簡單的，對，是，這件鎖定，但是。

在這件鎖定上，你會不會，放在鎖定上，你會不會放在鎖定上，你不會放在鎖定上，你有要會有一棟，或者取出 Yours，就是在鎖定上，你會有很簡單的鎖定，或者是，是，做的，士警， whisk，那種啊，回到了。

我在香港的資訊信息時，註本当要求賂當天 你知訊，為你們是出面，你也隨時就在一起，你已經早已飛出了，你居然在趕後啟數，像舞后街上情绪，她有过一个桿子，一个桿子，你们在一个问题里，我们在临场，在临主场。

打的时候，只是临面，我 finished，这个厄兵，你说，被村中的UFO動лен的共青口笑，回到後的遊戲，只是像珍桂，我剛回到順口差Bpop員，甚麼都不想，很厲害，夢名淦，第一種味券，是今天這回生意。

我要說，玉棠，最在此無關的，殒 slippery嗎，遇到了，老伯質你，封蘇criider，組織面子時，像電影史，ọi元素仰人，就能很有力量，嗯護長話，現在是洛羅的，一般人這樣，你作為主狀。

如果你是實在的，雞腹，你或者是，雞腹，可以直接，只剩一步，還是你們，祝你，你的喜歡，就是等你，我去看看，旁邊的角色，會正常，您的表現，特別別的女性。

这 I meant this creeps in to the dynamic of the relationship and it your fucked。。。 it's over。

 So with my ex that the most recent girl that I would go on pick up with。

 She knew what I did for a living， You know， because it's not stupid， It's funny。

 like as a law firm say， Does your girlfriend know what you do？， She has a computer。

 She has the internet， yes I'm pretty sure she fucking knows， right？。

 So she knew what I did and she was interested in it，然後她發了iele，說幫我們可以去お願い，一起去，她說，我们會加錢，黃面雨，手拿起來。

 rape，我們會加錢，所以這個已經要加價，然後findame，我好像會賠給她，我席，免費很好，我就爭 你知道嗎，但是不用叫說，我不聰明，公司如果你在下手，你已完成了，然後我們開始做。

因為我 wanted her，她是那樣看見的，從 Fight Club，她是在等於，在社交所，或者是，在某個電腦的電腦，或者是電腦的電腦，所以，她是電腦的電腦，然後她是在，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦。

跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，你把電腦的電腦，跟她說，她說， girls will say。

 women will say， like， oh yes， this， I， I would like to do this， but then when push comes to shove。

 they're like， they're， they're， and they don't actually do it， and why would a girl， agree to this？。

 well maybe she thinks that， you know， you won't actually， go through it。

 maybe she thinks it's just a phase， maybe she thinks that， you'll do it one time。

 and then that'll be it， that'll be it， right， so， that's， like a huge， huge reason。

 that you have to make sure， that they're，我覺得不同事件會甜點，不想要，有，好，好，唱歌，W 나중에，好，要，眼 commitment，我跟你講，Awmare。

我得排，推， cares，夢，活動，願意，經常，要，互 Download，我可以不可以做，所以在 both the instances。

 where I was going out with a girl， who was picking up with me， they were highly， highly aggressive。

 like highly aggressive， to the point where I would be like Jesus Christ。

 like I'd be sitting at home， like what do you wanna do？， watch Game of Thrones tonight。

 and she's like fuck down， let's go bang some horse， I'm like Jesus in shock， you know I'm like okay。

 I guess we'll do that， and then we go out and you know do it， not just like that。

 but also in terms of like， I'd be a lot of times， I'd be out with the girl。

 I'd be like oh the tab like an Eskimo kiss， or something， and then my girl was like yeah。

 and now we have a real one， bleh I'm starts like finger banging， and I'm like holy shit。

 like she used to wear this vibrator around her neck， it was like this little。

 this tiny little vibrator， necklace around her neck， and she'd be like equip vibrator。

 and like we'd be on the dance floor， or something she'd just like ram it up， some girls asshole。

 like I'm like holy shit， she's highly highly aggressive， so again I think。

 a lot of it's like lightening in a bottle， you know， the first time that I met a girl。

 that was you know down like that， and had that temperament， was obviously back in like 2003-2004。

 and then when we broke up， in like 0506， I didn't get another girlfriend。

 that was into that until 2015， you know 2014 so， ten fucking years， so once every ten years guys。

 right you'll find that lighting in a bottle， but again， it's also on you to capitalize on it。

 when you do encounter that， and you know， go through with it， because if you do， go through with it。

 I can assure you， it will be the best thing that you ever do， with your entire life。

 you know having three sisters， was probably the best thing， I've ever done my entire life。

 in terms of philanthropy， for the world， aside from possibly， obtaining ripped abs。

 that was probably a close second， and a lot of people will tell you， they'll say oh you know three。

 since it's kind of cool， but it's not that great， these people are wrong， it's fucking awesome。

 it's like， driving two sports cars at once， if that was， somehow possible， now how do you think。

 your online dating， has affected your life， because you just came in with a program。

 called execute the program， and it was like 2。0， 2。0 version， and I guess， the technology has been。

 till we change， and you've done so much， of your life focusing on， cold approach。

 but these last few years， you've been focusing so much， on online dating， programs and videos。

 right， well it was interesting， because you know， a lot of people。

 that's the kind of the perception， but even back when I first started， no two。

 I was heavily into online dating， now of course I wasn't， called that back then， it was like。

 my space， no actually it was called， Friendster， that was like the original， space which was。

 of course the progenitor， Facebook， and I would just like， meet girls on， fucking， Friendster。

 and just message them， on there， like you're kind of cute， dork， winky face。

 and then like go from there， get a phone， over and just hook up， like I was doing all that。

 I was doing all this， ever since 2002， so I've always seen， online as a viable way， to。

 take it girls， and of course， in this day and age， I think， we've yet to really see。

 the full ramifications， of the mainstream， acceptance of online dating， you know it wasn't really。

 until like， 2011 that we started to see， you know， okay cute would come to the， fore and like。

 sides with actual， functionality that was， because I was getting， laid off like Yelp。

 you know what I mean， people always be like， Yelp， what's that it， restaurant reviews。

 yeah like post， restaurant reviews， and then girls will be like， your reviews are funny。

 I'd be like， thank you， you appear to be， like a baby polar bear， sliding down a rainbow。

 with no pot of gold， what's your phone number， yes， you know， what is saying， you can enabling。

 you should probably， call me， good， and be able to， put something， in ten， of the， devices， because。

 my，以前， at once， finally，Kid in the Candy store，And that's what enabled me to，You know。

 So methodically， map out， What it takes precisely to have success in that arena。

 And that's what I intended to execute the program to be， Was an encyclopedic， cataloging of every。

 scrap of， relevant information that I had， With regard to online dating， And so you know， And again。

 When I when I did the first one in 2014，我不是像市民，available，A driver，貼口， Item，Set， morning， Rama。

on dynamic， wait next week， from the whole program，that's the day after，at 8pm， 9 h'ık，alæd。

we don't really want to， мире， We want to put out classics，and we can see they'il， gonna be like。

Its gonna be like，oh，Oh，oh，oh，oh，所以百合一切的，等会突然結束，罗诰 desperate，南霜，所以在民群參與問題港版的。

你爸爸，還是，因我íve Actually took the， time to fashion an opening message。

 and craft an opening message of their own， and took the time to actually send it to you。

 so if that happens this almost on you did not fuck it up， and another kind of side effect of that。

 itís so funny to see， Because you know， women have never had to come up with， the openers before。

 So itís funny to see their openers， and theyíre just so bad， Theyíre like in fact， itís like dudes。

 In fact Iíll read you some like，這就是一段時間了，所以，今天，Hey， How's it going？，Hi Jeff， nice to meet you。

What's up？，So， you're a minister who smokes weed，OK， that one's pretty good， My profession on here。

 it says minister，And then when they say， are you really a minister？， I'm like， well。

 there wasn't an option for Jesus， Pretty good， too， So。

 I'm really loving Bumble for that particular reason， Because it's more qualified leads， So， yeah。

 check it out， give it a shot， give it a whirl， What do you think are the keys to actually gain the girls to meet up with you？

， As opposed to the next guy， OK，OK， well， that's kind of， that's a very complicated topic， But。

 where do like three things that make you just stand out？。

 To the point where she actually wants to meet up with you？， Well， OK， yeah， Well， all right。

 I think there's a lot of things going on here， That's a very broad question， But number one is。

 a lot of guys I think they pushy-foot around too much on the app。

 They don't really go for the clothes， quote unquote。

 Most guys that I see that are posting their interactions。

 It just seems like two girls' chit-chatting， Like two girls faffing around trying to make plans。

 Like， so how was your weekend， herp-d-d-d-d， herp-d-d-d-d-d-d-d， like look， Now， granted。

 on the opposite pendulum swing， you'll see guys that just like go for it。

 Without building any sort of like rapport， connection， whatever you want to call it at all， So。

 you have to have a happy medium， And what that comes from is having like a， excuse me。

 what I call a， you know， essentially a sales phone， And so， you know， girl sends out message。

 I send response， I might say， you know， one of a number of prefabricated lines， Like。

 I'm going very normal these days， I go， so are we dating now？ I'm not sure how this works， Right？

 Or like for openers， you know， that's a good one， I know Max has one， what is it？

 Just a small town girl， Right？ You know， another one I like is when I say 10， you say， dur。

 And then they， and then you say 10， and then they respond， dur。

 And then you just take it from there， so， you know， different opener， not even like good。

 just different than what's up， Because that's what they're all fucking saying。

 Like literally everyone's fucking saying that， Then。

 maybe ridiculous over the top compliment of some sort。

 then I will do a series of qualifying slash screening questions， What do I say？ Do you drink？

 Do you， do you have tattoos？ Do you see karaoke？ Are you a vegan？， Right？ And then they answer。

 and then I give my answers to that， like I drink， I，， Well， San Francisco karaoke champion of 2005。

 that always sounds cooler in my head before I say it out loud， And then if they respond to that。

 I'm like， okay， I'm sold， let's meet up for a mother fucking romantic date， Okay？

 And then if they say， okay， I go， here's my number， what's yours？， Then it goes to the phone。

 then the sole purpose of the phone is to arrange the date， Again。

 I go into like extreme detail on how this works on ex-cath program， However。

 understand that getting a girl to meet up with you is not necessarily the end all be all。

 Like just like a good metric for a good opener isn't how many girls respond to it， Okay？

 Response rate is not the sole metric that you should be judging your opener on。

 Just as getting a girl to meet you out is not the sole metric， Like， oh。

 I got her to meet me out because she might be a fucking moron or a psychopath。

 Or a bamboozler or just a waste of time to prove to any number of things， So again。

 the hallmarks of the program are number one， it's a volume-based program。

 Which is required because the signal to noise ratio is so poor online。

 Because every shlamel like Johnny Schmuck is on there without fear of rejection， You know。

 because you can just approach approach approach， And he doesn't have anyone to like give him the look and laugh at him like in real life。

 So you know， balls， everyone's got balls online， Right。

 real internet tough guys and so everyone's on there so you work volume number two。

 You're running a system of some sort， you know， you're not just haphazardly going about things。

 You know， it's systemized， Number three， you have a relative amount of automation involved。

 Because otherwise you can't work the volume， So on my phone I have a variety of keyboard shortcuts on my computer。

 What I'm going through things， I have a variety of shortcuts that just insert。

 Of course you flesh out in between， but this stuff， you know， is going to provide that skeleton。

 It's going to make it very easy for you to go about working that volume， Right。

 and then last but not least screening， You know， and screening is very important too， Screening。

 you know， are you even going to get along with this person。

 Should you meet up in real life with them， And that's very big as well， Right。

 so I'd say those are kind of， you know， those are kind of the broad brush strokes。

 Of things that take into consideration with， you know， online updating， Go ahead。

 if you guys want to check this out， to execute the program。com， One final question。

 I wanted to find out how do you use some of the skills that you've learned。

 Through dating and pick up in the business world and building the Jeff Brand and managing your teams。

 Skills that you've picked with RSD， how it relates to business， I mean， I think， I mean。

 the number one thing is， Well， there's an old joke， right， you know。

 because essentially every instructor is self-employed， You know， their brand is their job。

 that's their company， You know， we're under the umbrella obvious of RSD， but at the end of the day。

 Everyone's on their fucking own to like hustle it up and make it happen， And so， you know。

 you've got to， what's the joke？， Like， you know， become self-employed， start your own business。

 be your own boss， You can get to choose your own hours， Any 16 hours a day you want。

 any 16 hours a day that you want， you can just select， So， you know， it's， it would， look。

 could I see myself ever going back to corporate America with like a name tag， And then you're like。

 yes sir， Mr。 Johnson， I have the GSS scores from last quarter right here。

 Let's go to the meeting now and hold a fucking clipboard and pretend to be awake。

 And then the customer comes up and I have to like not be a fucking dickhead to him。

 And when they're like clearly on the wrong， no， obviously I can never go back to that。

 Like I'll never have a job again， like even if like for whatever reason I'm not working with RSD in the future RSD collapses。

 Or the government fucking collapses， I guess no one would have a job then， But， you know。

 I'll never go back to that again and it's a rough grind but you know， it's very worth it， I mean。

 you're obviously an entrepreneur， like what do you， what's your take on that whole thing？， Well。

 I've spent 10 hours building an RSD founders club。

 And I've been doing this program to kind of go through the whole process。

 But I think I'm pretty much in summary and as executive summary， the parallels are pretty extreme。

 Because the skills that you should have built through core approach and relationships that you build in terms of。

 Do have the comfort to trust， rapport and the whole process， And the process of picking up a girl。

 you do the same thing when you're building teams and relationships in the business world。

 I also think that management of contacts in terms of all these girls。

 you do the same thing in the business world， And I also think a lot of the live events and things that you do。

 kind of like setting up live events for RSD， You do it in your day and life， for dinner。

 for meetups， what have you， and the day to process， Well， you know。

 it also gives you deeper insights into the nature of work itself， I think， You know， what is work。

 what does it mean？， Like， yes， it gets you money to buy shit， And you ever see that one， Louis CK。

 where he's like， what if God came back， he'd be so pissed， He's like， what the fuck did you do？。

 What's all this shittles over the ground？ Like， what is this？， Why are the poor bears brown？

 What the fuck did you do？， Like， well， we need the oil， the oil， like， what is this？。

 What do you need this for？ Is that for money， like a job， like， what's a fucking job？， Right。

 so when you have a job， you just report to it every day and you get a paycheck， a salary， whatever。

 the same amount every two weeks， You know， it's easy to kind of just like not think about it。

 but when you're an entrepreneur， you're on the road as much as we are。

 There's also times when you have downtime， like， if you're not crazy， like， you know， you know。

 a lot of the younger guys， the new guys， they go fucking literally crazy from traveling for years on end and take zero break。

 It's like， dude， you got it， like， that's why I've always like maintained a home， I have like pets。

 I have like friends that are not involved with this shit， And like， don't even care about it。

 like if I talk to them about it， their eyes glaze over， like I'm talking about。

 like I work at the bank and I'm talking about like mortgages or something。

 But I do just shut up about this shit， like， so it's like normal， like I have like。

 I'm like rooted in normalcy， So I'll travel hardcore for like a long time and then I'll take like periods off。

 And the thing is， when I'm at home and I have like several weeks where I'm kind of doing nothing。

 I'm just like going to the gym， cooking food， going out， going to sleep， Like。

 and like just digging around on my neighborhood， it gets very existential， You know what I mean？

 It almost seems like you're in this like， gilded bird cage of like， white privilege or something。

 You know， because like， you have no worries， you don't have anywhere to be or anything to do。

 but then you're just kind of seeing there like， what the fuck should I be doing right now。

 Have you ever read the book by Henry Rollins， the singer of Black Flag， Get in the Van？

 I've heard about it， but I have to say something， One of the very inspirational me， in fact， any。

 I think that should be a must read for any fucking RST instructor to be honest。

 He actually got a Grammy for the spoken word version of that book， but he talks about his。

 when he started with Black Flag， he was a， just a fan who went to one of the shows。

 And then he got up and sang one of the songs and they brought him on to be the singer of the fucking van。

 In a van with them， you know， and getting in fights literally every single stop of the tour and like。

 interactions with the police and like riots and shit getting arrested， violence， breaking his hands。

 breaking his bones， And how shitty it was on the road， but then when he was at home。

 he just wanted to get back on the fucking road， You know what I mean？ He's like， god， I'm home。

 but then when he's at home， he just wants to get back on the fucking road。

 And I can really relate to that in a lot of ways， like， look， you know， sometimes when you're。

 you're schlepping your ass， You've got a bunch of equipment on a six hour cross， you know。

 transcounted or flight or worse， you know， like to Australia or something， Like。

 recently I went to Australia for a weekend， for a quick weekend trip， Thanks Julian， so I， I， I， I。

 I， I， I， I， I， I fly from San Francisco to Australia。

 Give a program and immediately come 14 hours back， right？ But the thing is， even with that shit。

 it's like， Even if I'm reluctant to get up on the stage， once I'm up on that stage。

 giving the free tour or whatever， that's when I'm like in my， my fucking zone， You know what I mean？

 Even if I don't want to do it， like Tyler sometimes will drag my ass， like just get up here。

 just fucking talk， I'm like， dude， I don't want to fucking do this shit， it's like just do it。

 do it， and I get up there and then I'm like， Okay， so anyway guys， do， do， do， do， do， do， do， do。

 do， do， do， and then I'm like， boom！ And it's like， it's like， that's my home， I live in that。

 I live in that space， you know， just like boot camp， even like sometimes， you know， these guys。

 I'm just like， oh， you fucking go， I'm like， like， you know。

 the angry dad or whatever with these students and stuff， it's like。

 could I ever see myself doing something else？ No， why？， Because when I work in corporate America。

 you don't get the same， I guess you'd call it fuzzy， warm。

 fuzzy feeling inside when the student does have success， you know what I mean？。

 Like my students this weekend are not the sharpest crayons in the box， let's put that way。

 but they both pulled last night， first night of the program。

 they pulled the girl with extreme coaching from us， you know， and then they。

 of course they blew it back in the room， But they pulled， because we， you know。

 we can't hold their dick and put it in for them， but that's not a part of the program guys。

 we don't， we don't go back to your hotel and hold your wee wee and put it in and out of her hoo-ha for you。

 unfortunately。， Nick hasn't permitted that yet， I wish， I wish one day he will， but， yeah。

 but they both pulled and， you know， just seeing that happen and seeing like their eyes light up and realize this is possible。

 you know what I mean？， Like you're changing their lives in a measurable， quantifiable， actual way。

 you know， and so that's ultimately that's why I continue to do this job， and you know。

 I know at times I come off as a little arrogant crass， what have you？， But in reality。

 every single day of my life， I am just like filled with gratitude for being in a position that I can present this information as material to people。

， Awesome， well thanks Jeff， let's， she got the world summit venue and catch up with the boys。， Okay。

 I'm too excited， cheers。。
