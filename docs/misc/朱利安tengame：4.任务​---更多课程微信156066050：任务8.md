I told you before I laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，I'm not sure，I just can't take my eyes。

Can't take my eyes off you，This is Julian and welcome to mission number eight。

 okay now this one here， We're still going out every single day。

 So that means for the next seven days straight， You're going out for 20 to 30 minutes。

 minimum daily， Okay， but don't worry， This is the last stretch。

 next week you'll be able to slow it down a little bit， So you just have seven more days to go。

 And to be honest here at this point， Okay， we've done seven weeks of this， This is the eighth week。

 It shouldn't be that hard， You know going out every day， Should not be that big of a deal。

 You should pretty much be desensitized to it， It should be pretty fucking chill， Okay。

 so that's the first thing， For the next seven days， 20 to 30 minutes every single day， Okay。

 number two， And I mentioned this in the last mission video， We're going to work on merging sets。

 Okay， so the last one， We did the Mass Approach Challenge， For this one here。

 I want you to do a series of merging， Of five sets minimum， Okay， so what does this mean？， Okay。

 merging sets is basically， Introducing two groups of people， To each other， Two girls to each other。

 Two people who don't know each other， I just say to each other， Okay， and I do this a lot。

 Especially in the first part of the night， When getting myself into a very social mood， Okay。

 so I'll go out， And this is what I want you to basically do this week， Open a girl， Has it going。

 And now instead of just being stuck on this one girl， And then end your interaction。

 Go to the next girl， End your interaction， You're going to go， Pretty much like Tarzan。

 Branch to Branch， Girl to girl， So I'm talking to the first girl， Has it going blah blah blah， Hey。

 coming my friends， And then I'm going to go with her， And open the next set， Okay。

 and I mean introduce them to each other， Then when I'm in the next set， I can either stay with her。

 Or just fully focus on the next set， Or go back to her， But the mission here， Is you cannot open。

 Another girl without the previous girl in hand， And try to do this for five sets minimum， Okay， so。

 Has it going to the first girl， Hey， come here my friends， Boom hey， this is， Open the next set。

 Then take your girl from that set， Go to the next one， Hey， come here my friends。

 That's so on and so forth， Five sets， Okay， if you get up to three， And then it just somewhat ends。

 And you let your left no girls， Start back to ground zero， And try to get those， Five girls。

 Five branches， Okay， now with merging sets， You can make it fun as well， You can be like， Hey。

 come here my girlfriend， This is my girlfriend， Okay， it really doesn't matter。

 As long as it's part of the fun， Be sure to keep leading， Okay， I'm big mistake。

 I see you guys make when merging sets， Is there like， Hey， come here my friend。

 And they open the other girl， Hey， meet my friend， And you're always going to get like， You know。

 this look where it's like， What's happening， Like do we know each other， And if you're just like。

 Hey， meet each other， And then you just shut the fuck up， It's going to fizzle out。

 So be sure to lead with a smile， Like hey， me my friend， Shake her hand， Yeah， this is Susie， Yeah。

 this is just like， Shake her hand， Okay， leading with a smile， Tell them what to do， Okay。

 like when I merge sets， I'm pretty much coaching boot camp， Or I'm like， hey， I contact。

 Shake her hand， Shake， I contact， I'll just shit like that， Um， I'll uh。

 And I'll make it ridiculous， You know， I'll even like do a little role play， It's like， hey， no。

 this is， Susie I was telling you about， Yeah， she's the way Tristro Dredor。

 Like just random shit to make it fun， And understand too， That it doesn't matter。

 If it doesn't really stick， Okay， it's like， They're you don't expect them to spend the next。

 Fucking 30 minutes talking to each other， Sometimes they'll just say， High little fizzle out。

 And then you have to choose， Are you gonna stick on the first girl。

 Or are you gonna jump to the next， And even if it does fizzle out。

 You can always just bounce in between the two sets， Okay， and don't， Oversell it either。

 Just think leading with a smile， Plus it's not a big deal， Okay， if you're like， hey， so。

 Meet my friends， It's like this huge deal， They're like， what the fuck what's the catch。

 You would not， Overdo it， You know， if it was just meeting your friends， Okay。

 realize it's not a big fucking deal， Hey， it can be my friends， Come， it's just right over here。

 You know， and even if she won't say go meet the friends。

 What you can do is just walk to the next set， Tap tap her， Hey， it can be my friends。

 And then introduce her to the first girl， Okay， but I want you to start being the introducer。

 And uh， I want five introductions， In a row， Minimum， Okay。

 so that's the second thing for this week， Number three， I want you to practice moving girls around。

 And this kind of goes hand in hand with merging sets， You know， okay， come here my friends。

 Like move the girl， A lot of guys have trouble doing this， So I want you to do it when merging。

 But I also want you to do it with three girls， Moving them outside of the bar or club， Okay。

 so you're gonna have to go out at night this week， At least you know， one of the nights， And uh。

 it's basically walking them out of the club， That's your mission。

 I want you to walk three girls out of the club， Now with this， Okay。

 that doesn't mean you have to like pull them already thing， I just want you to get some reference。

 Moving them out of the club， You can say whatever you want， You can be like， hey。

 my friends in front can be my friend， You can say， hey， let's go for some fresh air， You can say。

 hey， how can you， You can literally say， hey， can you just walk me out in front。

 And then we can walk back in， It's just a little fucking challenge， Okay。

 whatever the fucking takes， Try walking three girls out， Of the bar or club。

 And when doing this too， Okay， remember， Baby stepping。

 And remember how much compliance you're asking for， If you're just like， you know。

 say the girl's sitting down， Hey， walk out of the club， You're asking for a lot， But if you're like。

 hey， uh， shake my hand， You know， stand up one second， You know， can I see something？， Hey。

 just take a step over here， Okay， take another step， Take another step， Oh。

 let's go grab some water， Oh， let's go for some fresh air， Like baby step it， Uh。

 your chances of success at this will be much higher， Okay， and you'll be surprised。

 Like just doing this， Like shaking the girl's hand first， Before being like， hey， don't rush it。

 You'll be like， out of the club， Be like， hey， how's it going， You know， just come on set。

 come on set， If you just do that， How's it going？， Shake hand， Come on set， come on set。

 come on set， come on set， You can literally almost， You know。

 pretty much walk into the fucking door， Okay， as long as there's a fucking smile。

 So that's the third thing， Okay， walk three girls out of the bar， Or club or venue， And number four。

 This is the last one， It's getting over any superficial insecurities， So this one here。

 On one of the days， What I want you to do， Is， uh， you know。

 Pick your most embarrassing set of clothes， Okay， where it might be like some old clothes you have。

 You just really don't want to wear， Whatever， You really feel insecure， Wearing， Okay， or whatever。

 Way you're dressed， It makes you feel kind of insecure， Like， oh， shit， I'll stand out。

 People will mock me， I don't feel comfortable wearing this， Uh， don't do your hair at all， Okay。

 it's like if you're a person who uses， Hair gel or hair spray， You're not allowed to use it。

 If you're a person who doesn't， Then you have to use a lot of it， Okay， but I want you to。

 Basically hit on all those， Superficial look insecurities， Okay。

 so where clothes that's embarrassing， Where your hair in a way that's kind of embarrassing。

 Or then that you're not accustomed to doing， That kind of gets you in your head。

 And go out and gain that way there， Okay， and you'll realize， It doesn't matter at all， Okay。

 and just one of those little challenges， To kind of get over those， Dumb little insecurities that。

 You know， after a while you're just like， Ooh， it just never was a big deal in the first place。

 Okay， so to recap， Next 7 days straight for 20 to 30 minutes minimum every single day， Number 2。

 merging sets， Okay， I want 5 merges in a row， If you fail， start over grand zero。

 But try to get 5 in a row， Number 3， walk 3 girls out of the venue， And number 4， one of the days。

 Dress in an embarrassing way， And get over those insecurities。

 Good luck。
