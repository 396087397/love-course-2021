I can touch in the topic of social networking skills，not like networking within the social circle。

but social networks， these online tools that you could use，like Facebook and other kind of sites。

 just combined people together， there's many that relate to dating as well。

 just like how our destinations when they pick up， there's ones of any kind of interest。

 the ability to use social networks， to share interesting experiences with other people。

 is a great value because，that allows you to reach out to people who what you want to capturing。

Have interesting experiences and you can learn from them。

 Some people will just use Reddit as that tool，As opposed to using CNN。

Because they learned more from personal experience， Some knowledge of others。

 Or from them sharing those stories that are more valuable。

 And from just searching the regular mundane resources， Of going to a site like CNN。com。

 Which has one journalists here， And one journalists there for like maybe five or 10 topics。

RZNation is For Educational Purpose，但是那是 Business，How I did and you know。

I still have a appreciation for the power of social networks。

 to allow you to stay in touch with your old friends， and stay in touch with your family。

 I could play a video game with you each other， you share pictures to allow people。

 who are in toy different parts of the planet， to stay in touch with you and know what's going on。

 I think that's really cool， On the other hand， if you look at social networks and how fast you're growing。

 how the average person is making social networks， into like thousands of people。

 or tens of thousands of people， and yet they maybe only know 10 of these people。

 or maybe they may have even met like， less than 100 of these people in their real life。

 but only 10 of them are like their real friends， it makes it even more so that the power of text messages。

 the power of the phone and power of being in person， becomes even more powerful。

 because the user social network kind of becomes overplayed out， and that's where it loses its power。

 and it becomes more like a photo album， or a press release， than it is an actual meaningful network。

 of a real social circle， so you can use it to stay in touch with old friends。

 or connect with new people， but utilize it mostly to connect with particular people。

 and develop those real meaningful relationships， because if you're using it。

 mostly just to stay in touch with people， and convey your life that's cool。

 especially if you're doing it for business purposes， and you have a brand as you want to build。

 on the inner hand most people don't need to do that， especially if your product or service。

 is not built around that brand， if it's not built among you。

 if it's built instead around a product and service， that product and service might be better suited。

 to have that social network， or how that particular brand， yet it's still fun。

 people just naturally love sharing their adventures， sharing pictures sharing their stories。

 and it's cool， on the other hand be very cognizant， that if you are a single guy。

 you will have girls Googling you， looking at your social media， and finding out who you are。

 if they don't like what they're going to see， it will definitely affect your dating life。

 you can also they'll use it， to make introductions to other people。

 or get introductions to other people， to not just connect with particular people。

 but connect other people that you're connected with， to other people。

 and that power being a connector， is being brought up again， because it is the basic。

 and not just basic， it's like kind of an advanced principle， but it's one of the strongest。

 foundational principles， that are important to getting a high network。

 and it's having that as a basic practice， course doing it in real life， is more powerful。

 going out to a event meeting people， and then hey I want you to do somebody。

 who I think you should really meet， I think that kind of thing， comes across really well。

 it's also fun， because you like a feeling of purpose， when you're doing these kind of things。

 I used to go to social events， not really feel like why I was there， okay I'm supposed to have fun。

 well I have fun networking， interacting， tinkering with the social matrix。

 and seeing what was going to happen， and I guess the social skills， impacting the social skills。

 and networking with， kind of these common purposes， gave it a little bit more of an edge。

 for more fun， but you know I very carefully， manage my social calendar。

 I very carefully manage my events， I used to basically say yes to everything。

 now I'm saying no to almost everything， I have very particular things， I get invited to。

 all the time over the world， I know that this week。

 I was thinking that I might be in the South of France， going with some friends and belly hills。

 to meet a Duchess， and going to her ball， in the South of France。

 I also had an opportunity to go to an esports arena， with some friends。

 and another opportunity to go hiking， with my wife and see George。

 and then look at beautiful mansions， instead I'm here in Los Angeles， speaking videos。

 yet at the same time yesterday， we had a cocktail party at the house， I'm trying very tightly。

 or organized with my social calendar， and a schedule， because I have business events。

 and social events， that have very carefully managed my time， Social networks。

 though can be a way to manage that calendar， you can post your events， and things like Facebook。

 and what have you， and share with your friends， I think that's kind of a cool way。

 to use social networks， that's a share of business ideas， fun thoughts， and videos。

 I know a lot of people prefer to do it， with email， that way， and know for sure。

 that people that they only want to see it， are going to see it as opposed。

 to all these random people that can see it， there is still a lot of value， in having a private life。

 especially if you become a public figure， like myself， where in the eyes of the law， in most places。

 it's very difficult， to fight when anyone says about you， and most business owners。

 are forced to become public figures， in the public spotlight， but it is a very fun tool to have。

 and a very valuable tool to have， if you know how to use it properly。
