對面還有Game，但是我們是這樣，你為什麼要聽到你自己，為什麼要聽到你自己自己，我聽到她的朋友們，就是在這裡，你知道嗎，我聽到她的朋友們，有很多人在這裡，我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起。

我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起，我跟她們在一起，July， Another thing to notice is facial expressions。

Good amount of my game is in fucking facial expressions，I communicate a lot，Like look at this shit。

It's like，I'm like high，I'm like a joker，Okay， observe the face，I don't know who's name is。

What's the，I want to try it with sitting on the name，July，This is me，Bone， just this subtle things。

Gets her hooked in，I need a lovely girl friend，And that's where I know her。

And you're getting lovely lovely，Who's the，What's the name of the singer anymore，No。

 I can't remember，It's like，I thought I was here last night，I knew the singer a year ago。

When I was here，How are you，And just that too，It's like，How are you，What do I do with my eyes。

Facial expression，I look down，How are you， How are you，Suddle，How are you，Just that，Okay。

This is something you'll kind of，Naturally notice the more advanced you get，You'll do a lot less。

But something you can practice to kind of get there faster，Is try to accomplish。

Whatever you're trying to accomplish，Do in the bare minimum，So what does that mean。

Say you're trying to get a reaction，Like the girl is like，What the fuck。

What are some ways of doing that，You could look at her clothes，Be like，What is that，Nice dress。

What's the reaction，What，That's the reaction you want，What's some other things you could do。

You could like dumb down or simplify to get the same reaction，You could be like，U，What，Or，Just that。

What，You get the same reaction doing a lot less，I do a lot in my game，It's like little things。

They get the same reaction，Which most guys have to do a lot for，Okay。

That's the more advanced you get，Actually a lot of it for facial expressions。

It's cheesy as it sounds，It's from the TV show，The Vampire Diaries。

I used to talk about that show all the time，For you guys have been around for a while，But no。

 that's like where I learned a lot of subcommunications，Because and a lot of drama，It's like so。

In that show，Super cheesy show，But there's every single dramatic plotline in the book，On a repeat。

So all the characters at some point，Date each other fall in love with each other。

Break up with each other，It's the same emotions over and over and over again，And number two。

The acting of these guys，Especially this one actor Ian Sommerhalter，It's so exaggerated。

It's ridiculous，But you can't help but zone in on the subcommunications，Like every little emotion。

It's like the eyes are amplified，It's like，Like that，You can even go on YouTube。

Do like Vampire Diaries，I think，And there's like copulations of all these little eye movements。

He does，So it's like your zone in you're like，Whoa！，So you can communicate different emotions。

And stuff through that，So that kind of got me in touch with it，And then you kind of amplify it。

And we'll do some exercises，I was doing that actually，I was doing that，Yeah，What was the quick thing？

，What was the thing you said in part three the night。

You can speed up the pull by amplifying something，Oh this is the one，This is part two though。

I amplified by doing that vacuum effect， Basically，Which I'm going to start doing in a bit。

But it all starts with these playful challenges，That I then start stacking，Rinkles right there。

Oh my god，So like this，Rinkles right there，Now once again the reason。

She doesn't get offended here is one，I'm not doing it to bring her down。

I'm doing this playful challenge，My challenges are pretty out there，And number two。

Because I'm on top of the 10 laws，I'm offering a lot of value in the vibe。

That's what's keeping her there，If you're offering nothing and you're just like wrinkles。

She'll be like，Fuck you dude and you're done，Okay，Oh，I'm going to be a warrior。

And a lot in the eyes too，And I'm like wrinkles right there，The eyes are like。

What you're going to do，But it's still like，I like you what you're going to do。

I'm totally showing that lot，And the time of girls like，You have wrinkles，It sounds so sorry。

It sounds so hard to keep her like，I love your voice。

So this girl has the most annoying voice in the world，Heads up，So I call her out on it，I'm like。

Man if I had to listen to you falling asleep，I'd kill myself，I hate you boys。

So if I had to listen to you falling asleep，I'd kill myself，Good and good，Good and good。

Good and good，Good and bad，It's like，It's like a bird chirping，Over，Over，I'm kidding。

I just never talked to girls，My French is perfect，My English is perfect，She's a little bit。

Your French is horrible，Say a Bonjour，It's not bad but actually that's not bad，Most Americans like。

Bonjour，No，Withjour，I mean I learned，I studied French in high school，That was many years ago。

When did you move to，I have a pro speed，Massive，But it's so sexy，I feel very pervy。

We could roleplay to hear my mom，Grammather，What，No，You know what，So there's like one little example。

I do the push，Funny enough in a compliment，So here you get really advanced，So I'm like。

You know it's so awesome，You're sold，We could roleplay to hear my mom。

So I'm complimenting her doing the backhanded thing，Then before she has her comeback，She's like，What。

What do you move to LA，DLEED，CUT THE THREAT，And now there's that little need。

Where she needs to have her comeback，That gets her chasing，My nonprofit，I'm never going to call you。

This is my nonprofit，I'm never going to call you，It's pretty much everything I'm doing。

It's like a little playful challenge，A little playful push in a way，You don't have to call me。

I'm outside your league，She's like，You don't have to call me，I'm outside your league。

Another stack it，Stack it，But thanks for trying，But thanks for trying，You know what，It's all good。

But if you go to my web，If you go to my web，If you go to，If you go to，Littleone，Littleone，Littleone。

I just cut it，Littleone，Littleone，Littleone，I'm so your mouth you're talking to me。

Let me tell you something，Wait don't move，I just want to see something，I'm just saying something。

Get on your knees and beg to talk to me，Go to the web，I'm going to my face，Look，Look，I never。

I like it，I like it，I like it，I don't know，I like it，Get on your knees，I don't get on my knees。

I don't get on my knees，I don't know，You very loud，You know me，I thought we had a special connection。

We do，But，Just do it，Now I'm the chair，It's not on the floor，It's on the chair。

I don't get on my knees，And that's I know you，Well get to know me，Do you live in LA。

Whatever you live in，Wow，I'm very forward，What's your address，You are forward，Mum of us，I'm gay。

You have to break down the walls，Get to that，What's your address，What's your address，Tell me now。

I'm beg，Mum of the book，I'm gonna give you a gas pedal，I'm for Philly，Yo，I can't like you。

You know what？，You're very fun，I gotta say，You're old to be your fun，I like you。

You're old to be your fun，Bang，Winwin，Good damn，Winwin，You can't ask it，I'm gonna，Oh my god。

You know I got it，I love me，I love you，I love you，I love you，I love you，I love you，I love you。

I love you，I love you，I love you，Yes，Petal，Shake your mouth， girl，You're making a fool of yourself。

There is something really special about you，But I'm being serious，There is。

There's something very special，So mean，There's something really special about you，Shut the fuck up。

That's my answer，That's like what I like，I'm honest，No，You won，You call me old，If anyone call me old。

I'd be like，Fuck，And please don't，I'll see you now，I can get away with anything，You call me old。

And then you set up a bunch of other stuff，And I'm like，Okay，Only compliments，But you have。

There's something like magnetic about you，You have，That's my looks，I'm just so beautiful。

No no no no no，But you have this energetic force field，Welcome to Los Angeles。

Are you kinda a job people in，So you can speak，And attract people。

And if you're taking something positive，And you wanna change the world，You're gonna change the world。

Time she's in the world，Okay so we should team up，And change the world，I'm so outside your league。

I'm so outside your league，Of course，Come back time，No，Everyway，But，But，But，But。

Personally and personally，I'm outside your league，Professionally and personally。

I'm outside your league，You might be outside my league，I might have done a lot more things than you。

I got it，I doubt it，Looking away，So again you start seeing the need，Just growing，Casing the chasing。

Casing，No I don't doubt it，I started a nonprofit in Kenya， Africa，I'm out of noble，Little one。

Little one，Little one，Little one，It's cute，You might have influenced like 10 African children，Honey。

I travel，I just finished my first tour，I influenced hundreds of thousands of people，Dude，Me too。

I think that's great，You influenced 10 African kids，Honey，I'm the second，I'm the second。

I'm the second，I'm the second，I'm the second，I'm the second，No no no no no，It's okay though。

But I've changed the lives of thousands，Thousands，But I'm smarter，But I'm smarter。

Bas is like stack stack stack stack，Honey，It's okay，You're smarter than me，Say it，Say it。

You're smarter than me，You want me to say that I am，No say it，I'm smarter than you。

Say you're smarter than me，It's not this time，Just do it，Just do it，No，Do it，And I'll totally。

Fuck love，I do，I can't fake love，I can't fake love，Are you ready？，No I don't fake love，I'm for you。

Baby，I'm for Daniela，Look at me，I'm more good，You love me too，Is it？，You love it by her。

Don't kiss me there，But it's for you，I can't，I actually do，Look at me，You're，You're the worst kisser。

Bang，You're，So make out，You're the worst kisser，And before she has her，Challenge back。

What is your name？，What is your name，What is your name，Like Stopic，Tell me your name，Oh my god。

Oh my god，Oh no，Don't worry about it，Okay you just，What's your name？，My name is not Morgan。

You get as try number two，I thought it started with an M，I was like M-something，Oh my god。

You can go if you want to，I heard you have a girlfriend，I don't，I told her that last night。

When I was a little girl，It was a girl I just met，It was not my girlfriend。

You don't have a girlfriend，No，No，Actually that's something，Okay，I fuck around，Listen to me。

Okay I fuck around，And I lie about a lot of things，So I will totally fuck around，You'll be like。

Oh this is this，Okay，But girlfriend and faithfulness，In relationships I would never fuck around。

You're lucky to the right that，These are lying，So tell me the truth，Girlfriends relationships。

I would never fuck around，That because I was part broken，I was a kisser，You just，What？，Ah！。

It's a different fight again，Tell me the truth，Look at my eyes，And don't look right。

Girlfriends relationships，Marriage，All that stuff I will never fuck around。

That because I was part broken，I was 15，Oh！，What is that？，Okay I can't，You're the tension，Okay。

I was part broken，I was 15，And it was kind of my fault，But，Wait， stop，Stare my。

It was kind of my fault，It's okay，We are a human，It traumatized me so much emotionally。

That I never wanted anyone else to experience that，And I will fuck around，But everything。

 Except for that，But everything else I will lie and fuck around。

But I would never fuck around in terms of like my girlfriend， or anything like that，I swear，Okay。

Not for you，But for her if I was dating her，Hey man，It's not good，Because you stare to my eyes。

Thank you，You're welcome，So you trust me now，Yeah，Okay，To a certain extent。

I don't trust anyone but myself，I only trust the actions，I only love myself。

I wish you loved me as much as I love myself，You know what？，I think when we love ourselves。

 that much，We can love everyone else，We are more capable of loving ourselves。

How does it feel to know that you are a horrible kisser？，Bang，Innerrupt。

How does it feel to know you are a horrible kisser？，Link back to the kiss。

 Dude you just fucking grabbed my face in the middle of nothing，I was asking you the same。

How does it feel？，I feel like oh my god，Shit，You have a front？，Maybe I am the old way of kissing。

I haven't learned the young way of kissing，It's not about that，You just grabbed my face。

And I will play，You gotta do worse，No I've never been told I was a bad kisser。

I've been told I was bad，You're average，But I have low standards，It's fine，You're average。

But I have low standards，It's fine，Look away，I'm a great kisser，You're old。

I want to break your heart，You're old，You want to break your heart，Look away，And again the need。

Building，Well we are，We are each other's mirrors，So what we see in each other，We see in ourselves。

So if you are saying that I'm old，You are seeing yourself，I'm very old，I wish I was older。

Because for a guy the older you get better you are，From girl，Downhill。

And then of course next comment，Not for me，I just finished a 200 mile relay。

from running to reach the San Diego，You don't have to qualify yourself，You don't have to try so hard。

You don't have to qualify yourself，You don't have to try so hard，So it's like stack stack stack。

And you see it building and building，Chasing and chasing，It's not that I'm trying。

It's that I know that I just account for something，You don't have to prove yourself I like you。

It's fine，It's like baby baby I did all this，It's like you know what I'm doing，You're good。

I just do something really great，And I feel as young as I want to be。

Is it young as a 12 year old girl，I am as young as I want to be，I'm as young as 12 year old girl。

I love it say daddy young 12，No no 12 is not good，12 12 is too young。

Do you ever watch the vampire days？，I have never，Why，It hasn't intrigued me。

I don't know if it's kind of afraid to kiss you again，It was so bad。

Bang kind of afraid to kiss you again，It was so bad，I'm sorry，What's my name？。

My name is whatever I want you to be，I forgot your name so it's fine，But what's my name？， Pull back。

And you just see that need building and building，What's your name？，Tell me now，Please tell me now。

Please tell me now，What's your name？，I'm the one who's the best，I'm the one who's the best，So again。

 you can see the tension build big time，Chasing big time。

You have to have the bind temperature big time，Here she's a lot closer to you，Let's go fuck，Tell me。

Tell me your name，No，Tell me your name now，No，I'm pretty sure it's Morgan，You're kind of sexy。

I'm not，Just saying the opposite，Whenever she compliments，You're kind of sexy，I'm not。

I'm like average，I just felt like something really awful，I'm really hot，I just felt like passion。

 desire，I felt bad about that because you're so，Bang， felt bad about that because you're so old。

Back at it，I'm so old，Yeah，Fuck you， you know， fuck you go， leave me，You have something going on。

 you're funny， Beautiful，Tell me I look like a Greek God，You have a pain here， so you can say。

Say baby you look like a Greek God，I didn't see you make it first。

Tell me I look like a Greek God first，I have the small penis as well，I'm like Korean。

I'm the way it's down，If you have a small penis， a large penis is all this，It's like this classic。

 like this and the rest，No， it doesn't matter the size of the penis，I know， all I hear from girls。

Well， I've heard， like when I watch the listen，I don't know how，I don't make a penis work for that。

Listen， listen baby，When I watch porn， all I hear is，Oh yeah baby， but in real life， all I hear is。

Baby， use your hands， I don't feel anything，I just settle for less， I was settle for less。

Stop settling，I know I should leave you right now，Dude， stop，Stop，I like you， honestly， really like。

I don't care if anyone do it， I don't even know you，You have no idea，She is gonna be like。

 how the fuck are you kissing these people，You know that， right？，It's my sister。

I just sometimes come to some sort of club，Do you trust me enough to have a drink with me somewhere else？

，Somewhere else， meaning outside of the venue，If they come with me， because I'm right home。

I'm really not a guy，My friend will drive you home，It's 1240，Can I have a drink？。

We'll come back here before you do before you close this，I don't，You don't wanna have a drink here。

But wait， my legs are really sore，We're not lucky there， we're not having a drink，Trust me。

Cabrio's illness， more chill， there's less people I hate this place。

But I'm gonna just go in like a corner on having a drink，No， I'm not drinking the first，Please。

 we'll be right back，We'll be back in like an hour next，Yeah， but here's the thing。

I haven't seen them and I can't see them，We'll be back in 20 minutes，It's changing right now。

 we'll be back in 20 minutes then，Trust me， just walk me out，Trust me， just walk me out。

Just walk me out，Bang， just leave，Just walk me out，What？，What？，Oh， nothing，Okay。

 so you don't have to wait until the end，This is more advanced， you don't need to do this。

But it's an interesting dynamic to kind of play around with，I'm gonna find advice。

 like get the 10 things down， get that fun vibe down，And then it just keeps you engaged。

 like do these little tweaks，Play around some dynamics for the fun of it。

Built on these good emotions overall，Where it's not gonna work and you'll also be very poor。
