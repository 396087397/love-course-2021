我們要引入大功機，一切保持基督，一些主要的問題，看來，它現在要插在上一屆，第一，第一，大勝利，真的很悔于，可能，只是urryUP，打幾後，而且不方便，還是還沒，前半，看著迷的，過來一半，第一。

這才是怎麼回事，那是1% of the night，再次打一支，Zoe他就忽焰，Rigit，Hasbist， enter the night，你畫什麼 Boys，直到尾印，你 practicing。

系列園，好，comments，儘管，打開，空調，想法，仔細，或者鼻子，唱歌，如果，也不得欢迎你，然后如果还要哄哄他，现在你会弄成，那不太好，好，好，你们尝设，其实牵手平平几期，这不是免出牵手。

他们必须找人，那不值得，不简单，对，而不宠个，不简单，不是，不能太多，我们问its，什么，这个 find，你 fight，你做方便，那是最初的一天，一天一天三天一天，那是時候會比較接近。

因為有些人都會有更多的感染，他們已經說過了很多人，現在就說好，我們會讓他們再多一點，這就是要讓他們拖到一個延遲，要讓他們拖到一個延遲，然後拖到一個延遲，然後拖到一個延遲，然後拖到一個延遲。

但如果拖到一個延遲，例如並不拖到45分鐘幫忙半個延遲，例如我在延遲，例如當中拿出了 every45 in 時間，因為是 airplane，就像那隻一個 each。

� Deswegen Help Make my narrator，我号仙没有，派报我，白土，都陪我，证虑，没问题，重点，只有一种，程度，就在这样一下，把它，一定鬍子，一點，想起，那种，丫头，提早。

这艘核掌，我发听过，大一断的，资金，5-10-minute game， and in your mind if you look back at some of your interactions。

 where it didn't go anywhere， you're like，， I can't see how I could possibly get better in terms of my game。

 and your game was perfect， it just you didn't reach the 45 minute line， okay。

 so committing to a set is big， having that long set， and also sticking to that commitment。

 because what will happen is， as soon as you pick a girl， and you guys probably all experience this。

 a million better options appear， you know it's like the grass is always greener on the other side。

 you talk to her and you're like，， fuck， there's her。

 and then guys just kind of bounce between at the end or left nothing， you know。

 or you kind of hesitate， you're like，， why don't I know which one to commit to？。

 which is the right one to commit to？， you know， just commit to one。

 you may have committed to the right one， you may have committed to the wrong girl。

 and nothing will happen， but if you don't commit， nothing will happen either way。

 so around midnight 30， you need to stick to a girl， it could be a new girl。

 you could text your numbers， and I commit to one of those， but you need to have a long set。

 and the skill set here is to build the muscle of endurance， a lot of pulling is endurance。

 it's holding that interaction， for 45 minutes to an hour and a half， and it's tough。

 okay it's tough because， we're so used to the short sets， that is kind of weird， like well now what。

 that'll pop in， and it's harder to endure， good reactions than battery actions， counter intuitively。

 because we kind of go in and it's like， yeah if you get rejected whatever。

 but if things go well now what， you freak out， guys panic， and you might have experienced this。

 you open something's going well， and something your mind's like， oh shit it's going well now what。

 what do I do it's going well， I'm so used to the rejections， what's happening it's going well。

 and then you'll either freak out， and do something a little too far out there， like make out。

 and she's like no it's over， or you'll reject for no reason at all， every guy does this。

 you reject for no reason， why it's a success barrier， it's like you're scared of it。

 actually going well， it's going well， you panic， and the muscle， where skillset need to build。

 is endurance， learn to be with good reactions， and to endure it going well。

 which is harder than it seems， okay， so we're going to crack into a， longer interaction here。

 I'll play this one all the way through， it's uh， well okay， it's 24 minutes 40 seconds。

 when this actually happened， I cut this one down， it was an hour and 10 minutes。

 so this is an hour and 10 minute interaction， cut down to 25 minutes， the reason I cut it down。

 is you'd be bored out of your mind， if we just play through an hour and 10 minutes。

 and you may even feel bored， after 25 minutes， like this will feel like an hour long video。

 to you watching it， but the lesson here is you need to start， aiming for this。

 and if this feels long， if this feels long， there's like the little red light， the blinking light。

 like you're too focused on these short sets， this feels long， that's a big same point。

 need to fix now， it's like get those long sets going， okay， and what you'll realize too。

 is that when you get that little question， like what do I do next， try to think more of the same。

 and the way I kind of go about it， is my game's little bursts of everything， on repeat。

 a little bit of fun， a little bit of push， a little bit of pull， a little physicality， lean in。

 lean back come for it fun， do it， and I just keep that going， and it's like building a muscle。

 you just keep enduring it， 45 minutes hour and a half， and then you pull， okay， but this here。

 and this interaction here， this is your ideal， situation for pulling， most pulls will results。

 from interactions like this， it's not in the first part of the night。

 and it's not in the third part of the night， that's when the club closes， and it's on the streets。

 and it's chaotic， you can pull third part of the night， and you will， but it's chaotic。

 and it's kind of out of your control， the bind temperature is high。

 like the girls are ready for sex， so you have that on your side， but it's too chaotic。

 unpredictable， this is the predictable method， this is where most results will come from。

 it's around midnight 30 or one， boom you stick on a girl， you spend a nice hour with her。

 you get all the logistics， you win her friends over， you build that vibe to the point。

 where it's logical， to take things further to sex， and it's a smooth fucking pull。

 that's most results， this is the ideal， so， here i am， i open the girl， these are two friends。

 she's there， and i'll play through it， what， nice laugh， nice laugh， fell in love years ago。

 i've been waiting for the opportunity， to fall back in， why the hate girl。

畜� Principle， and that's why it's so hard to learn too， because you can't put this。

 like it's not logical， it's emotional， it's like if someone told you like， you got to feel this way。

 it's like what's way， you know and that's why people can't really learn， it's really tough to learn。

 it's like you have to emotionally recognize it， which you guys see here。

 then you have to kind of experience it with yourself。

 and then you need to find ways to keep experiencing it， to become your default， that's the game。

 and then once you reach that point， all the game really is， it's a game of logistics。

 you might have heard that， it's like that vibe there， like at this point when I go out， all of this。

 is like taking care of pretty much， I don't have to think about it so much。

 because I mean I know half years， it's just default， and all I think is。

 okay what are the logistics， how can I move it there， what's the situation。

 okay when friends do this， do this sometimes it's impossible to do the logistics。

 but it's just a game of logistics after a while， yeah it's pretty fun。

 but yeah prioritize feeling good， and that's why I even break it down in these 10 laws。

 it's like whatever you can do to feel good， because if you're not feeling good。

 you can be doing all the perfect techniques， you're not feeling good， that'll transform the girl。

 she's not going to feel good， it's not a win-win， because when she goes out。

 her goal is to have an abundance of fun， okay， yes， and you were saying earlier about。

 when you get the validation from girl， because you put third you feel less。

 you're trying to continue to set， yeah， that's a big problem for me。

 and I wonder how do you deal with it， how do you motivate yourself to stay in a set for that long。

 when you know you like to you and you know， I like that。

 well first of all just realize like the absurdity of it all， okay because what is it like。

 what's the reasoning behind it， it's your view of yourself is so low， that in your mind。

 not necessarily consciously， this is all subconscious beliefs， and most people actually have them。

 and you have to work out of it， but subconsciously it's like， your view of yourself is so low。

 that if someone likes you， there must be something really wrong with them。

 or they must be really low too， because no normal person would like someone so low as you。

 that's what it that's really the reasoning， it's like oh she likes me， what's wrong with her。

 why would she like me， yeah you wanted her like you， but as soon as she does。

 you're like oh that's weird， so it's like you're always kind of caught in the middle。

 where it's like you don't have her， and no matter what。

 so kind of realizing the absurdity behind it， and from there also realizing that it is coming from pure taking。

 because that's your main motivation is going up trying to take， and then once you got it。

 you're like well now what I got everything， so it's fully kind of。

 you have to go through the process of like， you know sobering up from that addiction to validation。

 and getting used to or re-addicting yourself to like that giving vibe， so one challenge I make。

 almost every guy do at least they do a bootcamp after the bootcamp is go out。

 one night at least if not more， if this is something you encounter a lot I would even do it more often。

 where do you have a wingman so when you go out with。

 where you give say a thousand bucks to your wing and you tell him no numbers， no polls tonight。

 no numbers no polls， so， this is more like general say sex outcome。

 but there's no you basically eliminated everything you can take。

 you can still get the validation I guess but， you're now stuck there。

 where there's nothing to accomplish， you know and you still have to go out。

 and then it's like okay well now what do I want to do。

 no matter what you do you're not going to get the girl。

 and now it's no longer doing something to get the girl。

 that motivation will come from a different place， and that's kind of what everyone has to discover like when I'm going out。

 it's not to get the girl it's like what I genuinely want to do。

 and we're so conditioned I was looking at the girl like what is a girl like。

 what can I do to get the girl， that you never really take the time to ask yourself what do you like。

 what can you do to make yourself feel good， and you may encounter that blank too where it's like。

 you give the money and you're there and you're like， I don't know you know。

 and that should be the realizations like that's gaming yourself like you。

 need to figure it out and if you don't know stick it out and do a few more nights。

 like that till it finally kind of clicks in you're like oh maybe I could do this。

 maybe I could do that， what else could I do and then that's when you start getting creative like。

 what do I find funny， apart from the girl's validation what could I do， another one is also。

 another little one is like you can try， having genuine fun like interact with unattractive girls。

 because that too if you can't have genuine fun attractive girls you're taking。

 and because there's nothing to take your mind's like well why waste energy， why waste time。

 so it's like forcing yourself to do that like， you're not going to like it at first or maybe like oh I'm doing this to get。

 to the hot girls eventually， but at some point if you do it long enough， it'll click。

 and then you'll be kind of that'll be like the joy of like giving if you will。

 and it'll help you with the hot girls because， the reason you have trouble with hot girls too is that pressure of like labeling them as a hot girl。

 once you have genuine fun with girls you label is， unattractive， that means the label's gone。

 that's how you can have a general fun， and when labels gone with the unattractive it also is gone with that attractive。

 so get rid of it on one side it goes off on the other， so some little technical stuff to do， yeah。

 so I have a subtle question， if you're very caught up in having fun for the moment， yes。

 but are you ever feeling attraction back？， yes， those seem kind of strange like you pick up that your has had fun。

 well I say fun， think， think more how I wrote it here， I say fun a lot in the way I talk。

 think more feel good， I like feel good， it's more feel good like， fun carefree， passion。

 being attracted， you know anything that feels good that's your goal， yeah so it's not so much。

 necessarily fun， fun's part of it， but it's like what would make you feel good。

 that's what you prioritize， the way you should even judge like how successful you're doing throughout the。

 night because you're like well how well am I doing， and they look at their interactions。

 your only criteria is like how good do you feel， if you're continuously feeling better and better and better。

 you're on track， as long as it's feeling better and involving women， you know， uh。。。

 you're on track， but um。。。， yeah I know definitely feel attraction。

 but the difference is it's like oh it's cool if she's there but if she leaves。

 there's no longer that deep， it's like you already feel awesome。

 or make you feel better sharing that with the girl。

 would make both of you feel better sleeping together， you know kind of writing that there， yes。

 I just wanted to know if I missed it but how do you， hope that you know。

 like getting yourself in that position where， you're really not worried about the outcome。

 like you were really grounded in the video， and that shit has to be like that。

 how do you cultivate same grounded， uh。。。 I'll give you the ideal and then the practical， ideally。

 you just kind of realize like， you don't need that like you are it's like you're enough and then you just。

 get there and you don't give a fuck， practically， find a way to give your。

 find a way to achieve that outcome you think， she'll give you without her， that's how you do it。

 it's like， I want her to feel good， this is why law three is make yourself feel good。

 how can I feel good without her， because if you want her to feel good and you know how to make yourself feel。

 good you don't need her to feel good， now you're in abundance， does that make sense。

 it's a head truth， you want the girl to feel good。

 that's why you're attached to it so the assumption is I don't feel good， I need her to feel good。

 if I don't get her I don't feel good， so you're coming from scarcity taking。

 so the question that becomes on a practical level okay how can I come from。

 abundance why don't need her to feel good， make yourself feel good without her。

 once you reach feeling good， there's no longer that need for the girl to feel good because you're already there。

 and then you can talk to her coming from abundance， that's why law three is like how can I have fun。

 how can I make myself more carefree how can I be more excited passionate， how can I do this to me。

 versus how can I get the girl to， give this to me， like accepting losing her。

 no it's directing your actions to yourself， most guys they go up to the girls like to the girl。

 then her reaction comes back， it's good it's bad， me it's to myself good to myself good。

 and then that transfers on the girl， are you constantly asking yourself what does like feel good to say this or。

 at this point no because it's just， I mean that's what you should naturally just be doing at all times like。

 you would never really choose something that doesn't feel good。

 but temporarily kind of condition your mind to be like。

 what's next thing to do if you're in an interaction what do I do next， what would feel good。

 then you get creative just good anything good， anything that feels good。

 notice how it's like the fact that your， well that there's like the red light that you haven't ever even brought。

 attention to that， it's like if you don't know it feels good how do you want to bring the girl in。

 what feels good it's like that step one is like now。

 just keep bringing awareness to what feels good， there's no logical answer like it's this it's only this。

 it's just like a general feeling just start being more aware of how you feel。

 don't get so obsessed with the girl like is she investing is you qualifying。

 what about the girl what about girl， what about you how do you feel well out。

 start bringing some awareness inside， and then you'll kind of notice sometimes it's tense sometimes there's an。

 honor stomach sometimes stress worry torment judgment， that doesn't feel good。

 you know being carefree at ease that feels good laughing feels good。

 being passionate feels good sharing giving feels good。

 anything just it's just feels good in general， but just start bringing for you it's like a lot of attention inside and for all。

 you guys like， focus more on you， you know， don't sacrifice that just to get the girl if you sacrifice feeling good she。

 won't feel good either because she feels what you feel。

 so it's ultimately like you're gaming yourself， 100% yeah so， this year is the long set the ideal。

 we are going to crack into some of the late night game though because that is， still part of it。

 so throughout the first part getting phone numbers， getting logistics。

 part two midnight thirty hits time to commit， if the girl you committed to say it fails， now what。

 now you're in part three， guys sometimes give up at part three and this is also a different way of。

 kind of viewing the night， most guys are the beginning of the night is more important than the second。

 part， the second part is where the game is played by the way there's a little sign， notes。

 the first part until midnight thirty that's practice the game didn't even， start。

 i'd rather you guys do poorly in the first half， then in the second half。

 because nothing will happen in the first half no matter what you do。

 guys give up it's like oh you know second part I'm tired now。

 now maintain energy so you're awake in the second part if you burn out。

 in the first part that's retarded， okay so second parts when it played say the committed that goes to shit。

 now you're part three that's when the clubs kind of closing people are out， on the street。

 by temperatures high so that's on your side， but people also going home。

 okay and you don't have enough time now to really spend say forty five minutes。

 talking to a girl because no girl is going to stand in the fucking street for。

 an hour talking to you， so you got to think open， and then， either pull or go with。

 you got to go somewhere with the girl and you better know where you're going。

 I see a lot of guys do like these opens at the end of the night and they're like hey what's up and the girls like。

 oh so the club closed kind of looking for a place to go and they're like。

 oh um so I don't know either， it's like have a place to fucking go。

 okay could be your place it could be going to their place if they're going home it could be bouncing for food。

 have a place to go， and realize to the part three of the nights。

 a lot of your results are going to come from going with the girl， instead of pulling， a。k。

 walking her home a company at home go with her。
