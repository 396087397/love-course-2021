通常看隨時隨時時間，IDAC或背Book，九雷的網站都是，那是 how we developed our business， and then you should share those。

 assessed stories with other people， to ask them to write that review。

 and ask if they can share a review， what that is and then post it on the internet。

 other people will see it， they might even share it with their friends， but you could publicize that。

 and if you do that enough， that word of mouth marketing， that grill is our marketing。

 which works for us， and the main source of our business， is what works for most other companies。

 that are really successful， Now that was our marketing strategy。

 everyone else has to develop their own， our marketing strategy was to do most of it online。

 other people you have brick and mortar businesses。

 they'll have to use a lot of that first impression， instead of having a website。

 but having a flashy， attractive， well-positioned place， in a place that has that target market。

 from doing a lot more research， other people use the news， or television commercials。

 so what have you， For us we believe that the generation that we're in， is focused mostly online。

 so almost all of our strategies focused， on having that global presence on the internet。

 so we went online on large organizations to sponsor us。

 now we're looking more into that kind of thing， we're chasing more sponsors。

 you've gotten alcohol sponsors， condoms sponsors， and all those sorts of other similar things。

 you get more involved， and we're probably going to chase that， a lot more in the future。

 and you'll see that， but develop a strategy that works for your company。

 even if it's just grill is downmarking， you're going door to door。

 every strategy that I've talked about， so far is stuff that I've considered and looked into。

 or even even done myself， because I have done everything from that。

 you know I've been on reality TV shows， I've done the online marketing， I've done news ads。

 you've been newspaper ads， you've done every single kind of ad， but we just are smart about it。

 we're looking at what works， what doesn't work， tracking with or getting that cost per acquisition。

 in terms of is the cost of advertising， going to be more or less than the profit margin。

 that we have， and we're looking at the net profits and growth， because more than anything else。

 we don't have that gross margin， which is， hope we're going to give you a healthy。

 margin to pay yourself， and then have a net margin， that's over to grow your company。

 if you don't have that， and you're going to eventually feel some suffering， and pain。

 and need to figure out a way to push forward， and the only way you'll be successful。

 to get out of those tough situations， is to get a smart team， most times you can't do it yourself。

 sometimes you can， if you're really talented， and you're on the ball， that's great。

 we have many people though， on our team that are in that situation。

 and by having many people who have that， we're overall stronger， and having that smart team。

 is why RSD is accessible today， when I invested in this company， my entire future， my career。

 all my money， and my identity， into this company， it was based on the investments。

 in those R-stean structures， and guys like Owen， who I believe， for hardly can accomplish any goal。

 they set their mind to have the morals， or work ethic， most importantly。

 and that positive attitude to push forward， that vision， the background， desire to see， to learn。

 and to be resourceful， to get the knowledge they need， for those things they haven't yet learned。

 and by having that mental attitude， that will help you succeed in business。

 and parallels in every aspect of your life， for those of you， don't have those resources。

 especially the money， get that free support， the power of the internet allows everyone access。

 to every single other person on the internet， and also to all the information。

 that they're interested in sharing publicly， that's not just those confidential private information。

 it takes a long time to short through all the jumble， but you could find out almost anything。

 what I'm doing so， especially to see YouTube videos， and on YouTube。

 people are publishing themselves out there， and trying to share the most valuable things。

 they have to share with the world out there， and most of the time they're doing that。

 just for fun to contribute to society， and help other people， I think that's fantastic。

 so many people should get more involved， with watching all these things， and in fact。

 Winder's training manuals， instead of watching a training manual。

 and trying to figure out something for a new gadget， new technology， new audiovisual equipment。

 like a drone or some other kind of weird gadget， what does go on to YouTube。

 and watch YouTube videos， instead to get that fatter quicker way of it， having it being explained。

 and I find so much more power， in that kind of technology than in typical papers。

 like using Google Maps instead of the Thomas Guide， to map your way around a city。

 and the key is don't reinvent the wheel， of course， always improve upon technologies。

 that will get you what you need further faster， is always better software， and you hardware。

 new knowledge， people that have higher skills， because they learned from McAdami。

 or from some other specialists， but you don't need to reinvent it from scratch。

 look at what's working with other people， and their businesses， especially because most businesses。

 even they're selling completely different widgets。

 will always have the same basic premises as business， almost any kind of business。

 I'm not an advisory board， I'm having to advise you boards。

 from everything from health and nutrition supplement companies， to junk removal businesses。

 to businesses that have management consulting， to educational service marketing companies。

 and video games， and video game teams， and I'm able to have that diverse base。

 because I have a basic base in business， and they're staying in the dynamics of that。

 and the same thing goes with using these skills， for any kind of soul for life。

 and any kind of social setting， getting that kind of mastery。

 and you can distribute to almost anything anyone。
