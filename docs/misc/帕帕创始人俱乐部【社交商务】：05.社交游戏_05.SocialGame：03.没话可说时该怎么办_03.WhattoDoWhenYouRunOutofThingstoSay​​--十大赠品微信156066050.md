特別讓他們一些，医荷及基於，我的妻理 take，在新加坡的世界上，有些人有做些些的运动，但我喜欢去看，《 World Class Improv》的，《 In Prof Show》，是因为你得到。

看你能看到，人们有用的，《 Conversational Skill》，在《 The Billion 》，《 Daps  Situation 》，《 The Ball 》，《 The Ball 》。

《 The Ball 》，《 The Ball 》，《 Do Your Eyes 》，是有点 pause，是很多你们，把你的话採训，这些话，情绪，和运动，也要发翻，走脆，一个 cut，然后，让这些听头。

如果你不看，许多在鬼，之后，说道具，运动，的Мы，虔谱，达，这家座，《空间  Mom's Denying 》，和我们之间，忘記，你把番茸，餺 scream，但没了撥正，Divine，I paint。

但這個就是，我一點心事，把我的朋友活過了，時刻使得到，就是一半的，致命資格，現在特朗普跟輪环，博尼一樣，中間是領導員，也發生有警告，性率，管理力，有電影，有一個不同言論。

我看 Don't Serve Auch，所以我們就，就擁有啊，因為我打氣，所以我像要有沒有，我還一 kindly，在我忍耀，有些都沒純緒，台crosage，我拿出去，等於有中國音樂。

要說人生 whether，用指保功了嗎，也不知道，例如鑫的是，我們想點個，臺灣且圖，以為依種一陋，並且示威，基因 advice，很清理吧。

我也要試試看那些 things that are most important to them， especially in the business world。

 but in the social world for me， in terms of how I was interacting with。

 whether it was my dating life， or my social life in general， or anything in my personal life。

 It's always been to try to figure out， what that is that's important to a person at the present time。

 thinking what might be on their mind， and then relating it to that。

 and then trying to elicit those responses， it allows you to avoid those uncomfortable situations。

而它的重要詞曲是，所謂是一個阿好吧，否則結束，反而整個從政治面前，因為這裡致是，在墨原體利用，估計是為其它現 暗出來的，不然你要進行，沒有解決，有覺得，而且我們想法，由它這麼簡單，對你看知情，能申請。

要做什麼事，或要做什麼事，或者是什麼事，要做什麼事，或是什麼事，或是什麼事，我記得在影片中看過，《The Usual Suspects》，在《Kevin Spacey Character》。

在《The Kaiser So Say Mofi Aboss》，在《The Bullets and Board Behind Him》，在《The Labyrinth Story》。

在《The Labyrinth Story》，在《The Labyrinth Story》，在《The Labyrinth Story》，中UNDER，台灣安排匪蘇，這通 entend請定，而江公佛。

let them go about ivenasures and stories，it's a skill set that you can develop。

but not necessarily in a way that needed， in terms of complete fabrication。

 firing a way that you could just create， conversational stories and sets to make things。

 interesting and fun， so that， that keeps the interaction moving forward， and its useful to do so。

 because， in the business world or whether you are social life。

 just being able to comersate in a way， that has entertainments and interest that。

 are people a huge skill set， a very valuable skill set， that is why public speaking。

自己是最最�女 ş腊視對腦屏心的，活善，其他其妝較精準，有疑 simples，言詞，會被ミ符，但可能很多恨，但即將別人說，想 Ignoring koń的，跟你不一樣，到 what you to say。

你說如何面對，或者你已不方便，否則你便跟你所說， 怎樣，你跟你說，我與你們今天的安全，並且解決你的，提無點，你的能夠，結 up，並且帶你跟我對。

因為 when you give people a feeling that they have an authority， and most people。

 especially if it's about social situation， most people can give you advice about business。

 especially if you're talking to somebody you don't even know what your skill sets are。

 but if your situation involves whether it's friends or some kind of drama。

 you can go relate to that because everyone has the ability to share experiences。

 everyone has the ability to share stories that are interesting to other people。

 so if you can just find those situations people love talking about relationships。

 particularly girls if you can find those interesting relationship topics。

 you can also learn a lot about that other person， how adventurous they are， how risky they are。

 how they will respond certain things， you can also talk about some of your most unusual news stories。

 some of your drama， like if you had somebody mess with one of your friends。

 in a particularly interesting way， or if you had an interesting adventure in Las Vegas。

 or if you had a friend who had a particularly life-changing， altering situation。

 I mean a lot of these deeper interesting personal touchy stories， maybe unusual。

 maybe difficult to list out as somebody might have just met。

 unless you are the kind of person that is talkative and able to kind of listen to all these responses。

 but this is not a skill I've always had， this is a skill that kind of had to listen to just being in the field。

 and talking to a wide variety of various different people。

 and is building it over time from tens of thousands of interactions。

 and maybe even more and I think a lot of it has the deal with knowing what you really care about。

 and then developing those commonalities than going deeper。

 then thinking about if you have an unusual common experience。

 from an unusual social experience and dating advice and dating experiences。

 is usually the most common of all of it， people love sharing stories about their dating past and what have you。

 and also allows you especially if you aren't a situation where you're on a date with a girl。

 figure out what she is looking for or what she's willing to do。

 how risky she's willing to be in terms of like her sexuality。

 and how you can elicit law of this as just being really open about you yourself。

 the more open you are about yourself these things， the more she's going to be wanting to open up。

 a lot of the reasons why people are so open to talking to me about sexuality。

 and their dating and life and doing it in the most extreme ways is because they view me。

 as the pick-up artist guy， the guy who's the CEO of this little pick-up artist company。

 you're going to listen to the same kind of response though by just conveying that。

 you're the kind of person who has that kind of response in life。

 and how they view the world in that particular way as well。
