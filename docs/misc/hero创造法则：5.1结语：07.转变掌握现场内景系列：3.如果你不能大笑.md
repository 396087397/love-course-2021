you are gonna try to disown that aspect of you，the last that is positive， that is happy，and like。

will this is bad，it must always be negative，and this is becoming more and more apparent。

if you just jump on social media now，and it's reinforced now too， with the whole hustle mentality。

 it makes you realize like oh my god， my head's blocking me。

 And another great exercise to get out of your head， to kill that front if you will。

 is to narrate what's going on in the moment， That little voice， that little chatterbox。

 like what's going on oh my god， people are staring at me。

 I'm supposed to laugh and not be able to laugh， oh I'm on stage and Julian's here。

 and everyone's oh my god， that voice narrate it， you know， by narrating it in the moment。

 kids，I hate，现在教育方向，不要来了，10 seconds even，OK， so I'm sitting here，This guy is looking at me。

 I think you're good，OK， Be careful not to go into story， like what your mind's thinking。

 Like right now when you said that and say people start laughing， What did your mind say？。

 Nairid that， Yeah， I felt a bit relieved because， Everyone's laughing now。

 I can also just let go a little bit， And then， OK， They're still expecting something， Seriously。

 no thought about this， No thought about this， OK， now Jiren is touching me。

 He's trying to take a picture of her， OK， now I feel like I'll go back， I'm stuck here。

 I don't stuck here， Hi， You're laughing， You're gay， you're laughing， That's why I'm just， No， no。

 it's not， it's not over yet， it's not over yet， Hi， Now， Let's just break this down， OK？。

 It's like basically you reach the point， Like we all hang on a certain image。

 we all want to do well， We all want to be cool with me here doing this shit。

 You reach the point where you just can't be cool no more， With some dude massaging your shoulder。

 Touching himself， licking himself， Like you can't be like， So cool bro， there's no way。

 You can sit here and be cool in that scenario， And that's when laughter kicked in。

 So as I mentioned before， it's robbing him of his coping mechanism， You know。

 trying to be cool and not laugh， that's you coping， If I rob you of that， Laughter kicks in。

 Authenticity kicks in， Fuck trying to be cool， OK？， This whole trying to be cool is not cool。

 When you hear be a cool person， A cool person doesn't give a fuck about being cool。

 And it links what we talked about before， You know the serious person， oh it's disciplined。

 Fuck that， the cool person， Oh， is serious， no， cool people don't give a shit。

 The guys who are the coolest are the guys who are the most relaxed， We're just like， yeah。

 just don't care， The people who can feel， okay around， The guys who are carefree。

 it's not someone who's like， Hello man， I'm very serious， it's like， ah， loose， You know。

 and you can feel it like an event like this too， And I've done events， a lot of events。

 Where I try to be fucking cool， There's a very different vibe。

 there's a different vibe with me going up here， Like， okay everyone， Do it like super serious。

 there's like a little bit of a tenseness， Versus， ah， fuck it， let's have fun， We're all here。

 let's fuck it like loose， You know， and a lot of that is destroy your fucking image。

 Destroy that ego， And you don't have to do obnoxious things。

 Like people read into that way too far like， Oh， let me like piss on the ground。

 just throw it in the back， No， But just do little things， Like， just laugh， it's like。

 what can I do？， Like， what am I hanging on to？， If I let loose， what am I afraid of losing。

 And then destroy that？， And the best way is like learning how to laugh at yourself。

 Like take yourself way less seriously， You know， here we're all thinking like， oh， it's so serious。

 And so it's like， no， nothing's fucking serious， You know， do shit like that， it's like。

 whatever you think， You might be doing like little gay thing， Don't get hooked on that。

 and it'll become the guy who does the gay thing， But little things like that。

 Like stuff that sparks up that genuine laughter， And understand this too， Like。

 getting yourself to laugh， Like， there's no logical thing to do。

 Because if you're thinking logically， It's not going to work because now you're logical。

 It's doing something that disrupts that logicality， Doing something that disrupts your ego。

 For example， something that's out of left field， Something that's kind of unexpected。

 So you interrupt your thoughts， Yeah， it's like you're like， oh， I'm very serious， I'm talking。

 I'm here in front of the audience， Something like that， it's like you know， expect you're like。

 what？， You laugh， The glimpse of looseness， Alright？， So， make yourself laugh。

 What do you feel like doing？， It's like we're chill， we're all just fucking around， You know。

 it's not like there's 300 people to stay in there， You know nothing about me else， Yeah。

 one last thing to do， just whatever you feel like doing， Well， make this fun， you're sitting here。

 You're stuck here for like 15 more seconds， Well， make the 15 seconds fucking fun。

 So I put the pressure back on in here， Everyone's staring at you to really get him to do it on his own。

 Okay， alright everyone， this is Tyler from RST， There you go， There you go， Now， do you feel better？

， This is just like a little five-minute example， but do you feel better than before？， Yeah， I'm bit。

 Alright， now this brings up the last point with fun。

 It's like learning how to give yourself props as well， Okay。

 somehow we have this distorted view where we get so hooked on again like misery， Negativity， misery。

 negativity， you can't laugh and you can't give yourself props， Okay。

 I see this with clients all the time， I'll give you two quick stories， one guy in Chicago。

 This is Link 2， Success with Women， Goes out on the first night of boot camp， At the end he's like。

 he stays with this girl as a drinks one and so forth and the next day ask him， So what happened？

 He's like， well， we stayed there for a while， And then you know， I asked her。

 she wanted to come hang out and she said no， And I'm like， okay。

 so then I texted her today and we met up during the day， And we had a blast and I fucked her， Okay。

 what？， So he's saying that， now while he's saying this story， We're all sitting。

 why he's saying this story， We're in a restaurant， some girl walks up from her fucking table。

 interrupts， excuse me， I'm like， what the fuck is this？ And she's like， she tells the dude。

 I saw you and， Can I just have your number？ And he's like， okay， I guess here。

 And we're all out having a blast at the end of the night， she's like， texting him。

 here's my address， Come over， like pictures her in her bed， he's like， should I go fuck her？ Like。

 yeah？ He's like， okay， And then next day he's like， I fucked her on the third day。

 Like literally talking about as if someone died， like he's like at a funeral， like。

 Then I fucked her the next day， and I'm like， what the fuck dude， And then another guy。

 this is two weeks ago in Stockholm， same thing， First night goes out， boom， goes on with the girl。

 awesome night， next day he's like， I guess the first night was pretty good， Well， what is amazing。

 you know， like if you could see her face here too， just laughing with the Tyler thing， You're like。

 I like Tyler， and he's like， yeah， if that's how you have a blast， like what is， You know。

 and I have to do this sometimes with clients where they're talking to， for example， girls。

 I can't see the girls smiling back at them， I live to take my fucking phone and be like， Pfft。

 run away， it's like who the fuck says， I'm like， oh fucking weirdo， it's like every time。

 They're smiling， take it in， So it's like， take in like success。

 like we always place this far way too high no matter what we do， We think， no， but there's better。

 there's better， there's better， constantly beating ourselves up， It's like， no。

 like if there's three things I could say， like if there was an app， like I might even make this app。

 Like three things where I appear， whether you're out interacting with women or in life。

 it's like one， it's all good， Like literally， whatever you're happening tonight。

 like oh I fucking just like， it's all good， Two， realize you're there， you've made it。

 a lot of interactions for example， it's guys realizing they haven't made it。

 It's like you think there's somehow you need more and you just keep chasing and then you just turn into a try hard。

 A lot of those girls you think you haven't hooked， you've hooked， you just haven't realized it。

 And then you fuck it up because you haven't realized it， And then you're like。

 well it's because I haven't hooked， like no you're hooking but you're not acting accordingly。

 And three， it's give yourself fucking props， You know。

 even here the fact that you're still somewhat negative beating yourself up when you used to have fucking a mate。

 Like you went up in front of this crowd， most people like a lot of people here would be shitting their pants。

 Or would probably say no and miss out on this opportunity， you didn't， you stepped up。

 And you were able to fucking laugh， Yeah， I want to do it when I feel down this shit， Yeah。

 well didn't you feel down before you looked miserable as shit， you know。

 And notice how you're still avoiding it， like I hope that I want to， it's like no。

 At some point you got to sit the fuck down and you should ideally do this every day and like give yourself props。

 Like were you looking for this event？， Yeah， where you don't look like it， Here you are in front。

 you killed it， you're here with me， I'm like dude you fucking awesome， And you can't take it in。

 If this was me， like if this was me like ten years ago even like。

 say I go to a Tyler event and this was me with Tyler。

 I'd be like when he did this I'd be licking the finger， That's how psyched I would be。

 I'd be licking that finger like there was no end to it， I just thought， I got。

 that's what I wouldn't even talk about， shut the fuck up， let me lick the finger。

 That's all I would do， take it in and it requires effort to take it in too。

 Because there's so much charge around like negative shit， like every time you fuck up it's like。

 I suck and people tell you suck， when you do well it's just assumed。

 Where's the party when you do well？， You know， at the end of every single time you go out at the end of every day sit down and be like。

 fuck what did I do well？， Reflect on it， take it in， You know， you don't have to always be like。

 no okay it's next thing， next thing， You know， you should be licking the finger。

 Stand up and give yourself a fucking round of applause man， come on， Hi， Now this is key again。

 it's like hooked on this negative cycle and we think it's gonna get us somewhere。

 It'll get you off your ass in the beginning but it won't keep you going。

 You want to keep going into the long term， create a cycle of positivity。

 Create a cycle of you giving yourself props so you're gonna give up very fucking fast。

 So I want to emphasize this too， if you're someone who has trouble laughing， You know。

 trouble giving themselves props， make this a habit at the end of every day。

 write down your successes， You know， don't fall asleep just replaying all the failures， Oh。

 I fucked this up today， this up on， I'm probably gonna fuck this up tomorrow， Oh。

 and there's this thing I'm gonna do， fuck fuck fuck， What did you do well？。

 What did you do well today？， Come up with three things， and lower the bar， you know。

 give yourself props on， Hey， you know， I woke up today and I brushed my teeth。

 I brushed my teeth well， Fuck yeah， that was a success， You know， I woke up today。

 that was a success， I'm watching this video， that's a success， what are your successes？。

 And if you have trouble， there's the warning sign， make it a habit， Again， this is not。

 it won't make it permanent but why not hit it from both angles again， This is the external approach。

 okay， the outer approach， To make this permanent for him too。

 it's really sitting down and letting go of all that resistance， You know。

 letting go of all the trauma that made you suppress it in the first place。

 And another thing too with laughing is get rid of that image that it's immature， You know。

 laughing is like for kids， bring that back， You know， that's where a lot of creativity comes from。

 just change the label from immature to creative， You know， get of course a good work ethic。

 But add that creativity， add that passion， That's worth missing， You know， a lot of people， yeah。

 they have this miserable work ethic， That's coming from compulsion， desperation。

 which you should let go of， But beyond that too， we're losing touch with this creative side of things。

 You know， returning into these miserable robots， And lastly too， with laughing。

 realize it's the ultimate form of self forgiveness， You know。

 when you're able to actually laugh at yourself， that's when you've truly， you know。

 forgiven yourself， Because otherwise， it's all these suppressed things。

 you just take way too seriously， And you know， a lot of people just get triggered and have these pain-body attacks all the time。

 When you're able to genuinely laugh at all that， it just shows you've released all of that charge。

 And I mean， it's a sign of just total self acceptance， Okay。

 so start fucking laughing。
