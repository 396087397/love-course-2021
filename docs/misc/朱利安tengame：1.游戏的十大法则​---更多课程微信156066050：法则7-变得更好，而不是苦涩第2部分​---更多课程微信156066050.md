 Law number seven，get better， not bitter，and this is an attitude， this is a choice，as we mentioned。

 pick up as messy as fuck，you're gonna counter a lot of adversity，you're gonna go out。

 you're gonna have good interactions，you're gonna have bad interactions。

 you're gonna have good nights，you're gonna have bad nights， a lot of shit is gonna be thrown at you。

a lot of， you know， we call these congruence tests，the girls are gonna test you。

they're gonna throw a lot of shit at you，this is not bad，ok， on one hand， expect this from the girl。

she needs to do this to see what type of person you are，ok。

 she's determining how attractive you are on the，you know， behavioral cues。

not just visual superficial cues， say she's like ok， I like this guy。

she needs to be sure you're that guy，anyone can fake it for a little while，is he really like this？。

and she'll test you，how does he react when I throw this shit at him，can he keep his cool，no， ok。

 thank god I figured this out early，so she's gonna throw shit at you，and you have a choice。

 you can either get bitter，get all pissed like oh fuck this or get all negative，or you can brace it。

 get better，you can kinda roll with it，get creative as we talked about before。

and link it back to one of those 300 buttons，and also accept the guess what？。

the more shit it's thrown at you，the more you kinda desensitize yourself to it。

and the stronger you grow，ok， that's how you grow，getting good at this is not avoiding the adversity。

 the same with rejection， most guys try to avoid rejection， they have a phobia of rejection。

and the key here is not to learn how to not get rejected，it's desensitize yourself to this phobia。

 desensitize yourself to the bullshit， desensitize yourself even to， the judgments， the pressure。

 the social pressure，it's not about avoiding it，it's about， getting better with it，ok。

 and understand too that， as you grow in value， you're gonna be tested a lot more。

 there's gonna be a lot more judgments， a lot more social pressure。

 that comes with the territory if you're the main guy，get used to it，ok。

 so it's not avoiding these situations， it's dive in and you have a choice， you either get better。

 or you get stronger and brace it， or you get all negative victim mentality， and pissy。

 same with a rejection， you get better or you get all negative。

 that's the choice you make and this mindset， you should apply it all the time。

 the more shit's thrown at you， the better， the more adversity you deal with， the more you grow。

 take on this mentality at all times， ok， and embrace it all， go through the fire。

 go through the fire。
