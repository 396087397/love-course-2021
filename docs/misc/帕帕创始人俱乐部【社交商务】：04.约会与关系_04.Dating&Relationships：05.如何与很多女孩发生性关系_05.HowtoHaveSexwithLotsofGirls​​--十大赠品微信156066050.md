 most people come to RISD， because they want to not just have a girlfriend。

 but they want to have sex with lots of girls， I would say that if you look at the majority of our guys。

 though in terms of what， that you want in the core deep down。

 is they wanna have a long-term relationship， that would be maybe two thirds， but then again。

 I would say one through very customers， have that as， the furthest things they would mind。

 and then they just wanna pick up and have sex， with as many girls as physically possible。

 you have guys like Joian， who in six months， might have sex with one to two hundred girls，两颗腰子。

有人甘疼，偷偷，暂楚，你要管为什么，用这一样，如果谁经常，练区，准备，飞机， And you have a lot of beautiful girls and they are soul circle。

 is a traditional those situations where you are in group situations and the one on one situation。

 And not just one on one situations， that， Are you and her just hanging out the one one situations that could have the contacts that you're actually there for her connecting with her and。

 you know taking the time to show that you're actually interested in her physically using touch and。

 interacting with her in terms of，你好 trying to mess up，我不懂了吧，我朋友，想要101，可以吃加多渊，地產，也找不到了，回欠他，他現場說，我選拟。

所以我只說，然後說，沒有真話，但是我，想無rue，很難地，回應，但，我要懂得回應，在美國，共壯國，共壯加多渶，坑高，在說，共壯銀行，有一位，他不想要想要想，他不想要想要想，他不想要想要想。

所以我只說Kisser，他就說，那就是有什麼意思，但是我認為， finding is not the hardest part， the dating process。

 but it takes a lot of time， going out there， and building this network， takes a lot of time。

 going out there and building a business connection network， takes a lot of time。

 and in the dating world， you got to invest in that， if you want to get those very experiences。

 most people don't have a network， unless you're a photographer， where you're really connected。

 to a massive amount of beautiful girls， in a metropolitan city like LA or New York。

 most people are not travelling to Vegas， and thinking of the party of I。

 where you have gorgeous girls， in the clubs， and there's like thousands of them， as a result。

 you got to take the time， refine your game， and build that skill set in person。

 so that when you do meet these girls， and it might be those rarer occasions， there are situations。

 that you're more likely to capitalize on， you got to go out there， and get as many experiences。

 as you can take those risks， and if you are one of those guys， from like a smaller city。

 like I grew up in college， into a smaller city， was it Wisconsin， it had a college network。

 and of course it was a really large school， into larger schools， but I consider that still。

 way smaller than like a metropolitan city， that's a huge much hopeless， I viewed that as rare times。

 rare rare times， when you just meet like a beautiful girl， that you want to interact with。

 pick up date， as a little bit more pressure， but you still have to take the time。

 to practice your game， get that internal intellectual tech， and then you know move forward。

 to communication verbally， and physically， you got to be able to consciously。

 clarify your intentions， when you're interacting with women without fear rejection。

 you got to know those situations， you're always going to build reference experiences。

 when I look at the social experiments， I look at it as if， you're somebody who's viewing the world。

 like your own social laboratory， where you can build any possible thing， and anything is possible。

 and whether or not what you built， is successful or is not going to lead to success。

 it doesn't matter， because you're going to calibrate in the future， it's going to be a failure。

 to push things to the limit， the same thing goes in sports， you will play a sport。

 and you might go too far， kick the ball to the left too far， if you're in soccer。

 hit the puck a little bit too soft， or too low if you're in hockey， or what have you。

 and it takes massive amounts， of autopilot responses， that you have to build within yourself。

 to get it right， and get it right on a consistent manner， and you'll have a social， professional。

 and business interactions， and the only way you can calibrate， your ability of conveying interest。

 and calibrate to skill is the gain that attraction。

 is from having massive amounts of field experiences， and those logistical game plans。

 so the strategic plans that you have， on dates， you'd also be conducive to this。

 look at where you're positioning yourself， are you positioning yourself。

 in a place that's close to a place， where you're gaining some isolation， and public places。

 is your logistical game plan， going to be something that's going to give you conducive times。

 to talk to her， are you going to go to those louder environments。

 like the bars and clubs for your one-on-one time， are you going to take her into a restaurant。

 or like an activity where you can talk， or you're going to take her to a theater。

 where you're just going to sit and have the entertainment talk。

 and where you're not going to be able to convey who you are， you have to look at where there's。

 a possibility to be alone with her， but have that time where you were alone。

 and have that time where you're going to be able to convey that， adventurous side of you。

 and really ask great situation， if a girl is really interested in seeing you spend time with you。

 you have to find out what her intentions are， and ask her about those things。

 that compel the conversation to go into the more of the topics， relating to romance and dating。

 have fun adventurous jokes and spirits， if you want to get the humor side of her out。

 if you want to like it， dirty and make it， more the humor like a dirty。

 or if you're going to do that kind of stuff， you got to do it without judgment。

 I know that Owen made a video on YouTube， where he was walking up to beautiful girls。

 and talking extremely dirty with them， calling them like dirty names， and doing that to a girl。

 and she was like laughing， and then we had this conservative dentist， walking up to her。

 and you know just asking， questions and then having boring statements， and then he would talk about。

 you know a random thing that， was not necessarily taboo， but was something to the effect of。

 would you ever consider doing this act？， it was like a very serious way of conveying it。

 and she'd go oh no of course， you're so dirty it can't be you asked that。

 and then Owen said the same thing， and he really wanted to do this and this。

 and he said that's so cool， and then he said the exact same thing。

 and the same matter and then she also laughed， and he's like see I'm the fun guy。

 I thought judgment or freedom， guy the guy who's willing to explore， and take this more。

 interesting and adventurous way， than the typical mindset。

 and you're able to convey that kind of attitude， with girls then you're able to actually get that more likely。

 than being that serious boring guy， that obviously， has a lot of， traditional mental constructs。

 they kind of get in a way of the typical way of thinking， so be ready for that。

 even in the position of being， RSD and studying all this stuff， it's so easy to fall back into。

 all-part response if you're not used to doing this， so many people。

 that maybe will get into relationship， or be out of the game。

 or what having to use to having this experience， will revert back to your core self。

 because a lot of people will revert back to their childhood， person， or person up， just naturally。

 just because that's who they were when they grow up。

 but you gotta remember that if you want to gain loss access， you gotta go out there。

 gotta find a place where the girls are， the beautiful girls are， a developer soul circle。

 get them into one-on-one situation， if it's from online or offline or what have you。

 but make sure those situations communicate verbally， and physically your intentions， calibrate。

 have that adventurous experience， and escalate， and if you want to see a lot of great videos。

 about how we do this， check out our hot seat， I mean that's what pretty much。

 majority of our programs for the last decade， have been about， in the future you'll see about。

 a lot more about maybe the deeper topics of， sex and sexual communication as well。

 however before you get there， you gotta convey that type of game。

 you gotta convey the right communication， and you gotta develop those feel-experience。

 and reference experiences。
