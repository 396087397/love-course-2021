通常推便在我們由預計時，，但有感覺都招商算不入一點數題。，所以，眾人交易修理成兩色。，用一個派對這些速度與如果更忻憑地是尖的。，相當地的小平下的過程時，，中間的長期半例，。

的正向不會成為其他的性能平在政人之X children去族產地，與令導致科幻的屁板 它與這樣的消費者在現實，，那 be ing 把方形式抗消，您是不清 heartless Airport。

你需要当日就先掉入，就知道你是在结析，然后這個現在毒藦，用法治来 durch认识，于是打破队 colour，装掉第一次，关键顺著，强舞，如果你個人重要，取得其公反复，来囗案，就是可以返律，而好乎。

那是安全夹，要不要愿意取消，第一， 全能，会用light，剧斜，知道，了解，我觉得，但是 Everything you do is going to be reinforcing that being。

 okay， and this is big， even if you do get a girl， because it's built on that assumption that I'm a piece of shit。

 it's going to reinforce， I'm， a piece of shit， And there is no winning， you have to fix the beam。

 Now if you're conscious of this， it's pretty easy， but， the big fucking obstacle is that。

 a lot of these assumptions，com much of the place is coming from a lot of the being。

 They're all subconscious， They're buried away in your subconscious， Until then you bring them up。

 into the light of consciousness， until you let go of them or get rid of them， You are fucked。

 You can tell yourself as much as you want， I guess I get it。

 I guess I am up here and there is a bullshit in the way， If deep down inside， You're subconscious。

对于那一条行李，你还剑 peoples阳神上跑去，对于说得更加重要的，这些地方是，我记得这个 synth，哦，像最好，有很多 Hi，eti，A，N，。。，OK。

 subconscious and subconscious， don't get caught up into words， but that's the basic definition，OK。

 a common metaphor to illustrate， the two is that of the iceberg。

 where there's the 10% of the iceberg， above the water， OK， that's your conscious。

 and then there's the 90% below the water， that's your subconscious， and the subconscious is where。

 again， it's all those thoughts， you're not aware of now， and this is also where you store。

 all of those thoughts， that， again， you don't want to deal with， all of those traumatic。

 Instagram 美 行業。，新闻的人不在此，町高隻，任務的弱點，是嵐的，蛋也好，什麽湊亂，憋鬱，我這場，這場，每天去吃，東西的，喝著，你會發現有些人會有多好男人，我會說，好，我們會有多好男人。

你會看到一段影片，我會說，我會說，你真好，你會說，我真好，你真好，你會有多好男人，你會有多好男人，你會有多好男人，你會有多好男人，那是真的好男人，那是真的好男人，你會說，我會說，我真好男人，那是10%。

但是，你會說，10%，90%，90%，你會說，你的穩定性性吃 males，因為你的穩定性好男，我就教你一個大跡，既然沒想到阿富汗，很想來煮這個水分，你為了做得好男人，但是每一個人，都沒命運。

去 the surface，ok， and until you deal with them， until you dive into your subconscious。

 you identify them， you process them， they're going to keep running you。

 and you're going to keep ending up thinking， like I'm not good enough， even if you succeed。

 even if you get the girl out of luck， let's just say， it's going to reinforce。

 that assumption I'm not good enough， and you'll probably self-sabotage。

 your relationship will go to shit， ok another example is， kind I had where。

 yeah the traumatic experience where， I was with his family， I won't go into too much detail。

 but with his family， and basically， you know the traumatic experience。

 reinforced that women can't be trusted， the women can be trusted， the no one can be trusted。

 and he gets in the game， and he's learning game， but again everything is coming from。

 ok I can't trust anyone， I can't trust anyone， and even if he you know。

 he actually started getting pretty fucking successful， but all of his interactions。

 like there was something a little off， and even the girls who he kept seen after that。

 at some point it would just end， at some point it would you know， like the girl would like。

 either leave or he would fuck it up， why， because there's， I can't trust anyone。

 I can't trust women especially， there's that assumption， and everything's built on that assumption。

 and oftentimes we're not even aware of it， like this guy was not aware of it， this guy was like hey。

 all my relationships are going to fucking shit， what， what am I doing wrong， how can I fix this。

 ok and it's again， what we talked about where you're trying to fix the effect， not the cause。

 the cause is bringing awareness， and be like hey wait a minute， what the fuck is this， ok。

 if I take some of my own， like here's an interesting one not， like funny enough with success women。

 but here's another one just in life， um， this is something I realized， it was last year。

 that I really kicked in after the media scandal， is that one of the assumptions or thoughts。

 that that been fucking festering in my subconscious for years， like my entire life almost， was um。

 kind of identifying with， well one it's like valuing drama over being happy。

 and kind of identifying with the， self-destructive， artists let's just say， um or you know。

 it's like， when it kind of shit kind of hits the fan。

 it's like you're this artist and everything's kind of like， shit's hitting the fan。

 like debauchery so on and so forth， um， that， was something in my mind， I'm like oh this is。

 this is who I am， and uh。。。， it would push me like this is what's interesting。

 is like it would push me， to succeed to a certain extent， just so I could， pop it。

 ruin it and deal with the drama， and then I would build something up， pop it， deal with the drama。

 build something up pop it deal with the drama， and that happened in different relationships where。

 I would succeed， to get the girl but then subconsciously I would be succeeding to。

 pop it and deal with the drama， if you look at the media scandal same thing。

 build the brand pop it deal with the drama， it's like this self-destructive pattern just keeps repeating repeating repeating。

 and it goes back you know if I look at my past like even when I was a。

 fucking kid it's like looking at different， bad guys in movies。

 I'm like fuck that's so cool look at us like， they're so successful and bomb the drama the pops you know if you take like。

 the movie， below the movie casino shit like that I'm like yes。

 and subconsciously that is a cat is a kid， like you know it's like that's that's the shit。

 and I didn't realize it consciously at the time I like why is everything， happening。

 and then subconsciously like holy shit， it's this fucking assumption everything's built on that。

 and then of course， once you identify it， then you process that you release it。

 but the big problem with our subconscious like， again as I said we don't often we don't know it's like。

 it's hard to identify it， it's like it's buried for a fucking reason。

 if you right now it's like there's all these traumatic experiences like it's， buried for reason。

 and you don't know that they're actually running your entire life， another one is。

 say you're definition of love or of a relationship， if you know say you're a kid。

 and your parents fight or something and， or say you know it's like。

 you feel like a massive sense of abandonment， that's your definition of love。

 and that becomes like in your subconscious， and now it's like consciously you may tell yourself hey I want a really healthy。

 relationship with a girl， subconsciously what's the belief no relationship equals abandonment。

 relationship equals fighting like my parents used to do。

 and then that's what's going to run you and that's what your relationships， are going to be， so。

 just with these examples here you can see how important， you know it is to。

 dive into a subconscious and how important is to identify。

 the different thought patterns that are running you。

 the ones are not helping you those assumptions you want to。

 get rid of and the shit you really have to process because until you do。

 you know it doesn't really matter what you do externally like。

 there is like reference experiences help， willpower helps but you want to be hitting it at both angles。

 okay if you take that example of um， let's just say that thought I'm not worthy I'm a piece of shit I'm bullied。

 you can change that by just， fucking tons of willpower on no I am enough， I am enough I am enough。

 and then getting external references with women that you are enough with time。

 yeah that'll kind of like， get like the balance will tip let's just say。

 but at the same time why not do both， why not be like I am good enough。

 get references reinforcing that while at the same time releasing， all the bullshit， uh。。。

 in your subconscious that I'm not， good enough， uh。。。 so this is important to understand。

 if you look at your life right now and you can often see it by just different， patterns， uh。。。

 if you look at say your life story or life situation is like。

 what has been happening more than once if you look at game if you're going， out talking to a girl。

 what's the usual， uh。。。 interaction what's the the usual， sticking point， uh。。。

 what's you know what what's just like what are the。

 patterns if you take a like a year of you going out what are the patterns in， your interactions。

 what are the patterns in your relationships what are the patterns in your。

 friendships so on and so forth， and you have to kind of identify those patterns and， as I said。

 most of the time they always link back to， uh。。。 childhood， and until， uh。。。。

 yes pretty much you just re-experiencing like those childhood traumas over and， over and over again。

 um。。。， and it doesn't matter like most of the time to it's like how successful you become。

 because even if you get say more girls， uh。。。 you're probably going to self-sabotage like all those relationships and。

 reinforce once again like see i told you you're not good enough， uh。。。

 it's what i said in the beginning here where， if you're。

 dating a girl and i'll see this with guys who break up with a girl， there's that saying。

 to get over your ex go fuck ten other girls， to kind of get you back in abundance。

 but what guys do is they break up with their girlfriend they're like oh i'm。

 gonna go fuck ten other girls but they're fucking the ten other girls。

 because of the break up always， reinforcing the break up built on that assumption there。

 and of course， uh。。。 that just makes it stronger and of course you're gonna mix miss your ex。

 even more if you fuck the ten other girls because you're always thinking about。

 the x reinforcing the x， it's until you， process that you can then move on， if you're learning game。

 on that assumption i'm not piece of shit i'm not good enough， you're gonna keep reinforcing that。

 even all your successes you will find a way to link it back to， i told you， you're not good enough。

 okay， so， one of the practices that i highly recommend you take on， and this is a practice you do。

 when you're at home okay this is not the out in the field practices the practice。

 when you're at home， is uh。。。 sitting down and kind of going through your entire life like your。

 life story， and going through these different， usually traumatic experiences。

 the kind of originated， uh。。。 these thought patterns or these assumptions okay if you were bullied in。

 school， it's bringing your attention to okay， here's the experience when i bullied。

 case we all go through it okay we all go through， anxiety， uh。。。 turbulence like all these like。

 just again traumatic experiences and they stay with us， and uh。。。 you have to go through it。

 and you have to read you have to learn to one identify them into， learn to process them， uh。。。

 so this means go through your life story and will crack in some q&a here， and uh。。。

 you know just kind of take a few examples， whatever it is okay it's like we all have it and it's usually。

 it may be tough by the way maybe like oh i don't have anything but it's like。

 get personal it's like personal introspection， uh。。。 that that's a skill you develop funny enough。

 but it's like not running away from it and just going into it like dive into。

 your fucking so much back okay， what are some like really traumatic experiences， bully just one， uh。

。。 some others are are usually in the stories just don't even tell your。

 friends about like the shit that's just really， personal different insecurities that's a big one。

 uh。。。 you know especially as a guy it's like if you're insecure， but just say uh。。。。

 you know a big one for a lot of guys is they're insecure about sex they're。

 insecure about their body they're insecure about their， dick size she like that， uh。。。。

 you can't really tell anyone about that if you tell your buddies are。

 it's super embarrassing so it's like your own little secret。

 and then you shove it in your subconscious， and guess what that should run you， uh。。。

 so it's it's usually stuff like that where it's like extremely personal， um。。。

 you know if it's something that happened in your family if it's， something， uh。。。

 you just any kind of like trauma okay it's like， the stuff you try to ignore。

 the more you try to ignore it， that's the stuff you have to bring your attention to， and uh。。。。

 basically the process involves okay it's not suppressing it， it's not。

 expressing it it's not trying to escape it， it's learning how to process it and release it。

 okay and the uh。。。， way that i personally go about it and i'd recommend you try out is uh。。。 in。

 once again the the happiness series on my youtube videos here below， um。。。

 it's the video how to let go and it's basically through breathing it's。

 you know bringing your attention to， the feeling， of uh。。。 that traumatic experience， and uh。。。

 it may be tough at first because you'll be scared of re-experience it， and then uh。。。。

 processing it by bringing it up and letting it go。

 like not judging it just letting it runs course bring it up letting it go， uh。。。

 watch that video for sure， but this is something that you do it on a daily basis like。

 you you again it doesn't mean don't go out you self to go out at the same time if， you do both um。。。

 you'll just fucking kill it， okay and even me uh。。。

 like here's another reason one like the media scandal。

 there's one like that that was huge you know it's like me going through that， like。

 i remember even after i'm like oh i'm over it now over it you know learn my。

 lessons one is over the over it， but now there's still like parts where it's like。

 there's different little things that are just not， resolved。

 and probably at this point to there's still little things are just not resolved， and um。。。。

 what do i do it's like， well one it's like you know don't prevent that from taking action like still。

 go out to get action but other ones just like for me it was like just sitting， there and like。

 replaying different things， um。。。， summoning the different emotions like the shit that at the time i'm like oh i。

 don't have time to deal with this， like suppress it， bringing that back up， you know， uh。。。

 different things that happen like boom now this happened it's like oh fuck。

 everything got worse it's like， replay it， and it was literally just like sitting down like this like replaying it be like。

 or where the emotions i felt， picture myself being there。

 whatever dramatic experience a was bullying， it's you sitting down right now and be like well。

 what was it like， like really picture it like， why was bullied was it like。

 or the kids name was the situation what's like the first environment that， comes to mind。

 how did i feel， if it was hurt， let the feeling of hurt like fully come up。

 it's like you have to let all those emotions mature。

 and then through that breathing exercise let them go and until you do， they're gonna stay there， um。

。。， and that's really the skill set it's like， understanding this this whole dynamic of conscious subconscious。

 understanding that a lot of those， uh。。。， assumptions a lot of the place it's coming from a lot of the being is in your。

 subconscious， uh。。。 and it's the wrong shit， then from their identifying it， and from their。

 releasing it letting it go， don't expect to， pull everything up， out of your subconscious right now。

 okay like you're usually， there's a lot of fear around it's like。

 remember you've been suppressing the shit， and keeping it there， probably for years， uh。。。

 you're not to be like， hold it let's let's bring up all that shit let's bring up all these。

 traumatic memories it's like no that you've been suppressing for a fucking， reason， uh。。。

 probably like the the thought like if you really follow it the downside is， like。

 you think if you bring it up you're gonna die， okay you think if you process that you're gonna die so it's like you're。

 gonna fucking like keep it there there's a lot of resistance around this。

 often i see with the breathing exercise， you have to release， the resistance。

 about bringing that out of your subconscious before bringing it out。

 but understand that there's resistance it's there for a reason。

 and you'll probably just get a little bit out of time， okay this is a practice that you do。

 on a daily basis， okay daily basis you tap into it， you bring some up every day。

 sometimes your subconscious give you a little bit more sometimes， just a crumb。

 okay it's like whatever you're just ready to release right now。

 and a lot of it you won't know till maybe like a couple weeks in。

 like for me if i take that identifying with the um。。。， kinda like the destructive artists。

 just making situations pop， at first i was like oh that's weird like i noticed the pattern。

 came in the spot， where did that come from， like shit i don't fucking know， um。。。， and then uh。。。。

 you know， i was like okay i don't know， it's there to my subconscious i just don't know i couldn't bring it up。

 and then after a while it's like wait a minute that kind of goes back to， different movies。

 that i that i watch when i was younger， that's interesting。

 oh shit that comes back to this one specific movie， that's over time。

 oh shit even when i was a kid playing toys， i was like created these dramatic situations with the toys。

 so it's like all these memories that just kind of you know once you kind of。

 bring your awareness and you just trust like， stay with it in like over a period of time like。

 your subconscious will release more and more and more。

 so don't freak out right now if you're like i don't know it's like。

 no it's like at least you bring your awareness to it。

 and this is a process okay it happens over time， reading through some of the comments now。

 okay my parents divorced when i was five felt abandoned。

 my parents keep comparing me to other kids and how good they are。

 now i've issues feeling not good enough， boom there's a classic example。

 okay now if you think of it here it's like， there's the situations where it's like you know your parents。

 you feel like abandonment so it's like， there's probably massive fear of being alone。

 and obviously that like if you're like well why am i so attached to the。

 outcome it's like do no shit like there's that fear。

 of you being alone if you being abandoned you know， and until you do that like。

 you can work on on the actions you can work on the doing but you have to release， this too。

 um the other one too or it's like hey i'm not good enough for those comparing， me to other people。

 like you may tell yourself even now like oh i'm over it i was a kid like i。

 really like your parents may even fucking like hey you know we we apologize， um。

 we we were way too hard on you you were an awesome kid。

 uh we love you you're not abandoned and so on and so forth you're like yeah。

 consciously that makes sense subconsciously it's like。

 it's still there so for you what you're gonna have to do is sit down and like。

 go through those experiences go through what it felt like。

 at a time when you were fucking kid experiencing this abandonment experiencing。

 um you know like oh shit i'm not good enough， oh these uh you know other kids are better than me like how did it feel。

 how did it feel when your parents did that， like those specific experiences it's about bringing that up okay uh。

 bringing it up not judging it and then of course， through that breathing exercise releasing it。

 and uh this is something you do once again on a daily basis and you'll。

 realize suddenly when you go out， there'll be a little less of that thought okay。

 it's not just gonna flip to oh i'm perfectly good enough like these are。

 thought patterns you you know that are on repeat over a long period of time。

 but if you combine this with going out your results will just。

 fucking explode true and my family is pretty fucked up growing up。

 my mom and dad were cheated on as a kid um， i bought into the idea that polygamy is bad。

 now i've accepted that abundance is key but now that you mentioned this old。

 feelings are resurfacing and turns out i never really dealt with it。

 perfect there's another like awesome example dude it's like。

 yeah you you're like oh you know abundance is key and。

 and it's so funny like this is how i like this okay this is how your。

 your subconscious will give you to it's like you think consciously you're。

 over it and if you want a little test to see it's um。

 um well here for example we talk about it it's like those old feeling。

 surface again so you're like oh shit there's still there you've been telling。

 yourself consciously it's over i'm over it i'm over it abundance。

 no because you haven't fully processed them um i have the same with um。

 like let's just take the media scandal um there were different uh。

 you know different different people that i'm still close to now but they。

 there were different arguments or certain things， and um there was one person in in particular was there was like it was it。

 should just got very heated okay just the nature of the circumstances。

 and uh i hated that person like at the time i hated there were like。

 deep feelings of hate towards that person， and uh once everything kind of quieted down i'm like okay um。

 i logically looked at him okay i can see that person's perspective okay that。

 makes sense so on and so forth um i'm over it， conscious i'm over it until and i'd even see that person i'm like oh。

 yeah whatever i'm over it all good um until， any kind of little disagreement popped up again。

 nothing to even do with the media scandal just little disagreements。

 and that just triggered all that other shit like oh this。

 fucking person like all that shit would come out um so anytime you're。

 you're triggered i carto uh calls it a pain body attack。

 a little thing like you oh like it just triggers a lot。

 that there's where you have to fucking bring your attention like holy。

 shit like i'm suppressing something there you know um so。

 so for you here's one right now you know it's like that brought it up like holy。

 shit you have to go dive deep and like actually process it are we mostly。

 looking at childhood or recent events too um all events all。

 events but um most of the time the strongest ones are from your childhood。

 because at the time you don't really know how to process them。

 let's just say as well as now like you don't have as much of an。

 understanding of the world like things just overwhelm you。

 a lot easier when you're a kid so like uh like it's overwhelmed and。

 maybe if you had that same experience now you'd be like oh whatever but as a。

 kid it's like oh my god like say you do something bad and uh your parents。

 punish you you may interpret that you know just something like that is like。

 i'm abandoned i'm alone i'm gonna die， traumatic boom they're now stuck with you um so usually it's as a kid。

 and also because it happens when you're a kid it's running your subconscious。

 for all those years so usually uh there's a lot more momentum and the thought。

 pattern or the assumption is a lot stronger than say more recent events but。

 recent events too like me with immediate scandal that affected me big time um。

 but recent events usually and this is what's interesting are always linked to。

 a childhood event some of these traumas to actually like bring them up。

 it's as traumatizing if not more traumatizing than going out and。

 interacting with girls it's pretty wacky it's like the the big ones。

 bringing that up like sitting down and like really bringing it up like i'll。

 do it ice-close and really letting those emotions take over um you'll。

 fucking cry it's it's it's intense okay like remember you've been。

 suppressing it for a reason how do we know it's been done successfully um。

 i don't know man so i don't know if there's like a a finish line i would just i。

 personally just keep doing it and then you know with time i just。

 everything just gets a little bit lighter a little bit lighter uh you'll see。

 you'll just get less you know reactive like you'll get less triggered by。

 different things uh and you'll just notice like your results will just kind of。

 improve like there won't be as many of those thoughts like all your piece of。

 shit um i don't know if it's like perfect like how do we know it's like how。

 how do i know when i've mastered game 100% there's no finish line really。

 i just recommend doing this as like a on top of going out like as an extra。

 practice one thing i will say too is that sometimes it does。

 have to get quote-unquote worse before it gets better like say you know it's like。

 you've been suppressing like this traumatic experience so i'm bringing it up。

 usually there's that resistance because you're scared of bringing it up。

 and then once you bring up a little bit sometimes it's like sometimes it's just a。

 little bit but sometimes the floodgates open and everything comes rushing out。

 and as i said you're overwhelmed uh in tears like all that shit takes over。

 and it may even take a few days to uh you know keep doing this like really let it all。

 out so during those few days there's a little fucking dip um but you need that。

 dip to go up okay otherwise it's still it's always。

 gonna be there you know you can't keep running away from it you can't keep。

 pretending like it's not there uh because even though you're not necessarily。

 aware of those thoughts or assumptions uh there's still active my self-esteem is。

 tied entirely in terms of what people think of me uh。

 made fun of being fat and having man boobs from my parents families at。

 kid i'm in better shape now but still feel like a piece of shit。

 another example it's like no like how crazy is this it's like。

 you you're a kid and people mock you it's like okay you're fat man boobs。

 so on and so forth now you you got more in shape， conscious like hey i'm in shape i did everything i could subconsciously。

 no you're still fat you still little fat boy like that's the。

 shit that you're you're sometimes just mind telling you。

 it's pretty crazy it's the same as someone's like again it's like you could be。

 like i don't deserve women so even get a girl in a relationship like you'll。

 fuck it up it's like i have the girl i did it you don't deserve her。

 it's like that shit will run your life until you bring it up and release it。

 so for you my advice to you is like like sit down and like。

 bring up all those fucking memories all those um， you know feelings surrounding you being made fun of for being fat。

 for having man boobs your parents your family your friends making fun of。

 you like specific situations like sit down and replay it how did it feel。

 you're sitting there how did it feel what are the mean things they they told。

 you what were the the motions you felt， bring them up experience them again now which is lasting you want to do。

 experience them again now and then watch that video that i'll put here below to。

 release them say you had like a troubled childhood with your your father。

 maybe you moved away maybe now you know you're like whatever you think you're。

 you're cool with your your dad and you may be right at this point you're like。

 oh you know it's young we had a little drama but we're all good now。

 and although you may be good that same emotion that you experienced with him。

 most likely is still active in your life and you'll project it on other people。

 so um you know i i remember feeling this like i felt like a lot of the。

 times like different employers that i have i'd kind of project the dad rule。

 and be like oh it was like the same type of fucking energy um。

 those surrounding say i dad to me when i was a kid so that's pretty interesting。

 so it's like that same thing would just keep being there and until you actually。

 process that it's you're just going to keep experiencing it again and again。

 and again so what have you experienced again and again and again。

 identify that and then look at where did that come from when was some other。

 times i experienced this maybe when i was younger anytime when i was a kid when。

 i experienced this and just bringing a lot of attention to that and。

 through the breathing exercises trying to let it go keep in mind uh。

 you're subconscious that's 90 percent that's most of what's running your life。

 um there's a lot of stuff in there that's not the right。

 being or it's not the right place that stuff you know the doing should。

 be coming from let's just say and until you bring it to the surface and。

 release it it'll keep running your life and it doesn't matter what you do。

 it'll be built on the wrong being so you need to bring that into you know。

 awareness um look at different patterns in your life。

 you know different times where you might over like emotions kind of take over。

 um try to identify those patterns try to identify where they come from。

 different traumatic experiences different things you haven't processed or。

 released and then make it a habit on top of going out it's doing both。

 of uh following again that breathing exercise and letting it go。
