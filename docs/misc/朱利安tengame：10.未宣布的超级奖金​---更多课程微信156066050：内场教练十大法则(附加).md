# 朱利安ten game：10.未宣布的超级奖金​---更多课程微信156066050：内场教练十大法则(附加)

 instead of resisting it， embrace it， tell the girl， oh i'm really in my head。

 oh i feel like everyone is judging me right now， oh i'm really nervous about how i look right now in this club。

 there you go， just by embracing it， suddenly a lot of those negative emotions are gone。

 and you're being real and you're being congruent， it's trying to be cool when you're not feeling cool。

 or like again cool， because being cool is actually being congruent， that's what fucks you up。

 it's like you're in your head you're worried and you're like， hey trying to be like， it's not real。

 it's gonna be like oh hey you know i'm really in my head right now。

 i feel like everyone is judging me， i haven't taken it， i haven't generated enough。

 i feel like i'm reacting to the environment， i probably gripped a little bit too hard。

 at that point i kinda like squeezed a little bit too hard， the second i was in my head。

 i did do the congruence， the congruence thing， that's actually when the girl came to the pitch。

 because i walked up to her and like， i told her， i honestly think you're cute。

 i don't know you too much further than that， i want to talk to you。

 because i'm really sad right now， so i'll just do this anyways， so if we talk， then she's like this。

 like alright well this is what we're gonna do， so what she said is that。

 it's not gonna be that shit， she goes， you're gonna， this is this are all tomato。

 you're gonna go get us two drinks， and you're gonna come back with them， you're gonna come back。

 and i was like， like these are just two of us to say， that she goes， yeah i was like。

 look i probably wouldn't mind buying a drink， otherwise， when you're cool。

 but the back is actually made me a little sad， that's not why they make you sad， maybe it's not。

 i don't know because there were nice people that first， like the girl was super nice， it's actually。

 i wasn't even coming from a gaming mindset， you should be happy when that happens。

 you determine very fast， there's no chemistry， it's not something someone you'd want to be with。

 what if she didn't say that， then she， would come out later， that's awesome， again it's like。

 this is not about making all the girls like you， it's sorting through the bullshit。

 finding the ones you're meant to be with， there are gonna be a lot， you're not meant to be with。

 and there should be， zero negativity， it should be like， okay sorry great night， duh。

 i put pressure myself， because i feel like she reacted that way， because i was acting。

 it's her thing， i thought it was my fault， yep， again for you it's as long as。

 it's coming from good intentions， as long as you're offering value， you're being real。

 trying to make yourself feel good， yeah， the only other angle you could think， is like okay。

 are the requirements met， can she hear me， etc。 etc。， is it win-win， relatable， yeah。

 and if so all that is met， let it go， okay fair， there'll be a lot of girls that will happen。

 like even inside you'd be like hey， and they're just like fuck off， okay， and also accept too。

 that these girls don't know you， it's not like this girl， who knows your entire story。

 where you're coming from， is telling you to fuck off， could be anyone， imagine like again。

 you're walking down the street， there's a bunch of homeless people。

 and say it's like you get ten in a row， and next is like really pissy， but like okay i'll be nice。

 and after a while you just， like you know what fuck this， like fuck off， don't was like why。

 you know it's my entire life， why would you do this， you know。

 finding where you generally find funny， but also lowering that fucking bar， guess what。

 when i say like， this will happen， i said like right down three things。

 you said it and you found funny， you're immediately thinking， the best shit you said。

 or like stand up comedy level， it's like what are three things， if i said it to join me。

 like really smart， it could just be， i asked her how old she was， like， that's often one in my list。

 like anyway how old are you， i mean it's not， maybe feel good， lower that bar。

 you said like fucking， thousands of these， i was literally just trying to， come across。

 it's like i don't care if i sleep with you， this is for me， this is fun， and i got caught in that。

 and i never actually， had to execute it， like the whole， okay， you know i mean i think that's where。

 i got caught， that explains it， but then getting deeper， it's asking myself。

 okay why did i get caught up in that， what was i fearing by not getting caught up in that。

 like you were fearing something， which was why you stayed caught up in it。

 because otherwise the way things go， and everyone that occasionally， falls into this。

 it's like remember expansion， if you actually play in the， when you're talking to that girl。

 you enjoy the girl， you would naturally gravitate， towards something more， totally。

 the fear is not always like obvious， but it's like， hmm， what was the blockage。

 unconsciously that kept me in that state， for sure， it's like at some point i let her go。

 because it was just like， okay i'm doing really good at gaming her， it's like， good watch。

 and i just want to keep a gaming， really good， first of all， sticking in the sack。

 and like the sack is like， all the nice， yeah， so what do you think it is， go deep， honestly yeah。

 fear of what， yeah， i don't know， this is where it's tough， this is where you have to go。

 full introspection mode， and it's like， it's can be tough to put in words， like go inside like。

 so if i'm going to like， take it off the face， i don't think it was like， you're， like not close。

 because it's good， like i'm pretty confident， i'm going to grow in the real。

 like it's going to happen， yeah， so the roof is so busy， and good shape， and the issue was。

 they put it， new， g c， you're， uh， they gave you the roof， right， like， we're the g c， i mean。

 it's stuff， go into the room， so we have the next， we're， that's the thing to reflect on。

 yeah right， do you have any， i don't know， like you're going to speculate， like what you say。

 i would probably link it to self-image， in a way， yeah， um and to what you mentioned， before。

 you're quite， too， for success， where it's like， gaming well， it's not to win。

 it's not to get the girl， it's not to bring， the interaction， to its climax， it's to。

 do well i game， and doing well i game， is very different than， f， you know， so it could be that。

 so then it's like， okay i identify， and then kind of， going， deep inside， okay what is my goal。

 what is my win here， because the community， would also， condition you on， it's not actually。

 to get the girl， it's to not fuck up， it's not to reject it， it's to actually get。

 good at this you have to， step out， out of a lot of the， community talk， so it's like， okay。

 what's my win， hey， in general your win， is feeling good， and in interaction， feeling good。

 that will translate into， the expansion that will， lead to the sport sex， it's not gaming well。

 it's not looking good， it's feeling good， and tapping that， with the girl， so。

 at least now it's like， it's something to reflect， on this just speculation。

 it's unique to everyone， whatever the fear is， but it's like， it's like， why did that happen。

 what was I， afraid of， what's so bad about that， how am I going to try to fix it。

 so kind of being aware， of that goal tonight， it's okay， my goal is， feeling good。

 and just keep on feeling good， following expansion， throughout the night， you know。

 and that's what make you feel， better， it's like at the end of the night， even if you get it or not。

 the fact that you kind of， stuck through and pushed it， to how far it would go， then maintain。

 like a superficial， okay I did well， say whatever you want to say， as long as， overall you're like。

 what you want to observe， is she relating or not， and if not， pick another course of action。

 that's still congruent， that she can relate to， now， except though， that at some point。

 I mean with some girls， no matter what course of action， you pick this congruent。

 it's not going to enter the win， it's like your sphere， her sphere， there's not going to be a match。

 where it's win winning， in that case it's like， we have a great night， but for a lot of girls。

 it's like finding， that middle ground， so it's win winning， okay， so I pretty much。

 I'm just trying to， kind of experience， in delivering， see how she reacts， calibrating。

 and then see what's the， most common thing， that's like， calibrating after the fact。

 but never sacrificing， the realness， if you feel like， the only way to make it， relatable is to。

 sacrifice for realness， have a great night， I noticed one thing， like a lot of times。

 you'll do stuff， that's actually not， very good， doesn't look at the girls'， reality。

 is it just kind of， shake up your own mentality， like when you feel， like you're， like you're。

 like you're， like to go a little bit， more， like because I know， it's going to do that。

 or like you're， going to pump your own， states， like for your own， zone， then when you， get it back。

 yeah it's okay， so a few things， it's won， remember right now， your only goal， is make yourself。

 feel fucking amazing， that's it， now beyond that， of course， you have to be， relatable， but。

 occasionally break those， I could， tone it down， to something else， let's congruent。

 to make it click， and I would feel good， but occasionally， it would also feel good， to just be like。

 fuck it， and say another， thing too， out there， it just have a runoff， I'll do that。

 I'll fuck up some， sets， if I find it funny， not always， it's like the， 1%， 2%， 5%， let's just say。

 and mainly， in the beginning of the， night， because， all these girls， in the first part of the。

 night， all you have to do， is go back to her， later and open， with the same， event， hey sorry。

 about before I， was fucking， around， your back， plus， she'll remember you， okay， and with reopening。

 as well， always get， the habit of reopening， because with that， tempo of the night， all these girls。

 a lot of them， are going to like you， and they're going to be， hoping to see you， later。

 when you can， kind of， estate， and you know， to the climax， but yeah， just make， don't make it。

 your foundation， really take that， pressure off in terms， of trying to do， well fast， the night's。

 fucking， long， it's long， it's fucking， literally everything， we do now， till on average。

 in the mid-30， it's all bullshit， we could talk to a， bunch of girls， here， get a bunch of。

 no numbers， in the mid-30， we're all going to be， here with no fucking， girls， literally， we'll be。

 different， we'll be， different， everybody， maybe， we could， get a real， but maybe， we could。

 get better， security， sometimes， sometimes， sometimes， I'd blame it， because， I say， you must。

 try to， put on， detachments， just pour， on， donor， needles，希望， bring， your， clients， together， then。

 July， then， General， call，因為就要擀待樓院，因為如果譬如有什麼，用命定的，點上要知道，要好好折pload，如果你現在直接，拿東方向，要不要真的，平常的用戶，是因為念刀。

沒矮聽，你要定裡面，要管神一點，妳要自國應該捉不上，傑克走了，好，OK，好，好，很凶， OK， Let's start getting those logistics。

 and start getting some numbers too， OK， You don't always have to do it， break this rule as well。

 there's a lot of girls I fuck around with， I'll just leave without getting the number。

 but if it's a girl you like， get the logistics， what's your phone number， text your name。

 so you got the lead， so you can commit to her later in the night， I mean night 30。

 I'm gonna come up to you， and be like， ok where's the set to commit to。

 I deal you should be in a lot， that should be like， your set for the night。

45 minutes set 二 hour long set 二 hour long set，ok 明 night 30，明 night 30。

Now it's the kind of uses transition，and if you're kind of aware。

you'll adapt to the tempo of the night，every interaction should be a little bit longer。

 as the night progresses，ok，and just in terms of your transition to it。

 all your sets right now are like two minutes two minutes， and then。

明 night 30 hits are like hour and a half， it's just too drastic。

So try to make every interaction a little bit longer，and it doesn't matter with who。

 just a little bit longer， so you kind of ease yourself in，ok，I open and you were there。

 it's just like fuck around with the wine， now funny enough when I opened to。

 there was a little bit of like frustration， because like we just shoot off that bond girl or something。

 and I was like god damn it， and I'm like you too， like that， just like like hooked， it was real。

 slow it down， then start fucking around， it's like yeah go do do do do do do。

 crack into that breaking bad shit， for me that's still new enough， in a way。

 I basically created again， it's like check this out， check this out， what's my fun I'm having。

 check this out in real or it， ok and this too should be the best way like you guys should view opening。

 ok here's a great catch line， the best way to open is to skip the open。

 act as if you're already opener， hey so anyway this is a do do do do do like that。

 it assumes familiarity and it reinforces the check this out， ok so that's why I did。

 I'm like yeah you know she's like what do you do， literally the breaking bad plot line。

 I got that from Luke， I find it fucking hilarious， it goes hand in hand with like stretching it。

 I'm like yeah you know I cook math， and she didn't catch on which made it even fucking awesome。

 like I kept pushing it to the point， I'm like yeah you know。

 my student was with a chunky girlfriend， she was Odin and I was watching her。

 and I used to drink a lot of the time， that's why I don't drink now。

 because she kept trying to offer me drink， I'm like no， and I just let her die。

 like full straight up， and she's like oh my god， I even like showed her like my name is Heisenberg。

 like breaking back， and showed her like fucking the Heisenberg logo， from breaking back。

 like that's my brand， she's like oh my god， because she never saw it， and I'm like psych。

 joke around a bit more， then slow down， get the logistics， she's like yeah I'm having this drink。

 I'm going home right after， I know she's going home early， bang where do you live， few blocks away。

 fucking awesome， yeah that's the more， meet you， I grab you in， and this too。

 it's like get those girls， meeting your friends， I remember you asking， whether you're left。

 she was like two blocks away， and Julia's eyes are like， I know like， perfect。

 but this whole like being the introducer， is big like， the more you can kind of bring people in。

 on the girls the better， don't leave the set， if you like the girl though， and don't let the guy。

 like fully take open， like you're still in control， but I'll use that a lot。

 oftentimes I'll do this， I'll just kind of open a bunch of girls around， and throw you。

 talk to her talk to her talk to her， like chess， and I like use you guys， to keep all the girls。

 but because I'm going to open some， through them on you， who are they thinking， about me。

 who's your friend， what about your friend， what about your friend， so you can like play that。

 you become the introducer， you guys should be the introducer， you open a girl。

 she should be throwing them on each other， because that too， it's like say I open a girl。

 hey this is my friend， why doesn't he want to talk to me， what， I heard about that。

 I heard he did that， I do it all the time， and again， then you fight it funny。

 and my mind makes me feel good， and it plays on that optionality。

 abundance takes a lot of pressure off， because I have all these girls， I don't matter。

 if you mention that， yeah， that place， that place is not my insecurity， because I feel like。

 after I go out， you're going to hit it off， and I just， nothing goes， well there's your scarcity。

 there's the pressure， scarcity， if you knew you'd， fuck a ten at the end of the night。

 would you care， you wouldn't mind， you'd like go here， okay， anything to reinforce that abundance。

 how would you act， if you're going to fuck a ten tonight， and this is another good rule。

 like it's all paradoxes， like playing those paradoxes， it's like， until midnight 30。

 until the second part of the night， no one has a target， still get the numbers。

 still get the leaves， that's the paradox， but no one has a target， you should not even be thinking。

 about a target， so midnight 30 takes in， this is my other friend Jordan， okay， now， good。

 now come on in， now a couple of things， fuck around be congruent。

 and be okay with their walkin' away， if any of you felt a little drop in the girl leaving。

 like oh wait no， where's the attachment， doing well that game， all good。

 it's about how you feel after， do you feel better， now， than before the open， the answer is yes。

 you're on the right court， if it's wrong， then you're doing it wrong。

 and that's the right here for success， fun， expansion， check， succeeding， give validation。

 or get the girl， there's only upside for the girl， and there's only upside for you right now。

 and the check ups is like， look around and take it in， it sounds super cheesy。

 but like look around and be like， fuck it out， here we are in LA， doing this， cool people。

 fuck yeah， and that'll immediately， sappy the fuck out of it， whatever the pity， like oh the girls。

 hell yeah， okay， now， with you， couple of things， and this is your big freaking point。

 think expansion， not alone but with other people， notice a lot of who you are。

 it's kind of like I played it on the side， you don't really participate that much。

 it's not like you're kind of like， scanning on your own， this is not something you turn on。

 with the girls， you should be like， gaming us， you should be participating here， you should be like。

 again it's like that chair， and expressiveness， not， okay， and that's it。

 if you ever catch yourself scanning the environment， horrible。

 where's the best spot to sit on a table， where's the best seat， the one you're in。

 you see yourself scanning， to be somewhere else， where's it telling your mind， this place sucks。

 the value of self-aware， no this is the place to be， you're not doing， what can you do here。

 to inspire them to come， okay， and it's not you， needing something external。

 it's you doing it yourself， and sharing with everyone， don't discriminate。

 don't only give it to hot girls， don't only give it to girls， give it to everyone， I gave you guys。

 I'm sharing my fun， right now to you guys， I do a girl to do it with everyone， do it on the girl。

 where did it go south， as soon as I try to pull her away， to the front， you turn into an obstacle。

 yeah， literally like the baltzer was like， hey can you guys move， so I just picked up a move there。

 now big one I felt her like， pulling and I was like， trying to like pull through it。

 but it just didn't work， yeah， a thing it's like she likes you， but she doesn't want to。

 split from her friends， get right， she doesn't look like a son， from her friends， yeah。

 and her friends， don't want to let her leave， with someone they didn't talk to。

 or get to know very well， god damn it， that's literally it， so that's things like， she was down。

 she loved you， yeah， it's a fucking French air， and that's the thing too， it's like。

 we tend to think like， okay I just see more attraction， from her， so she goes against her friends。

 when in reality， she's like， she's good， let's take two minutes， to like game all the friends。

 how can you go with them， every girl here is going back， to a bed， at the end of the night。

 how can you go back to their bed， but really good set though， really good， remind yourself。

 you're going in， good， intentions， offering fucking， value and realness， what are these。

 what are these girls， going to benefit， from talking to you， what are they going to get out of it。

 if you're actually focused， on the giving， you'd be fully at ease， if I told you right now。

 walk up this girl， give her a million dollars， would you be like， excuse me。

 would you like a million dollars， would you feel confident， interrupting her conversation， yeah。

 you're like， hey， check this out， you're like， a million dollars， it should be like that。

 with your vibe， right now it's， midnight 30， officially， so officially is a five， minutes ago。

 the real game started， up until then， not even the game， it's just like， practice run， it's like。

 it's an NBA game， that's like the， practice shots， the game starts now， so what does that mean。

 just in general， two just like， managing your energy， big newbie mistake， they run around。

 like crazy， the first hour and a half， they're just， lost in that， you know， you're just naturally。

 going to be exhausted， imagine going like， crazy， so， pace your night， just as a general rule。

 it's a marathon， at the second part of the， night， that's when you want to have， a bunch of。

 energy and be ready to， rock it， now ideally at this point， you have a lot of energy。

 but you also have， leads， you have a bunch of numbers， you have a bunch of， logistics。

 you remember the logistics， of every single number， and you remember， how hot the girl is。

 how many numbers， do you have， one， one， three， three， three， so just this， could be easily。

 corrected with a little habit， so it's naturally， happened if we're， thinking about winning。

 we're playing the win， because we discussed， like you think about winning， you're going to。

 naturally ask the logistics， if you think about winning， you're going to， actually try to。

 expand it， and if it stops， you're going to try， different courses of action， if you can't pull。

 or you go with her， if you can't go with her， you don't let her go， okay？， yeah we will let her go。

 because like， oh I tried to pull， and if it didn't work， whatever good enough I guess。

 or then you're like， oh I don't want to， look weak getting her number， you get her number。

 it's like playing the win， okay？， so， yeah it's like， driver of the pull， but also understand too。

 that in the first part， it's rarely going to happen， so if you try， expect it not to。

 necessarily go all the way through， okay？， you can't happen， like if the girl's down， don't be like。

 oh it's the first part， but a lot of those girls， just wait too early， so the best you can hope for。

 95% of the time， and the first half， is a number， so I'm going to be going， for a ton of logistics。

 a ton of numbers， there's a really good app， you can get as well， if you have an iPhone。

 it's called， new digits， it's a little yellow one here， it's like a buck。

 and it shows you all the numbers， you get on the date， and time， which you get。

 so all you have to do now， is say you get like， 5-10 numbers， you pop up new digits。

 go boil your numbers， lined up， now ideally one thing， I'd recommend doing too。

 is every time you get a number， until you can kind of， remember very clearly， who's who。

 write down the 5-fucking， logistical questions， answers to those questions， every single girl。

 like that's the key， imagine now you have five numbers， you remember all the girls。

 you text them your name already， you know they're logistics， right now I'm like。

 okay let's come into a set， yeah you can go up to a new girl， or you can go back to one of these。

 and you can make a lot， more of an educated decision， you know how， quote unquote。

 difficult the logistics are， you know how hot the girl is， you know say， hotness justifies。

 difficult logistics， you know kind of which one to go for， it's less up to chance。

 okay you always want to make things， easy for yourself， you think。

 now what can I do to make it easier， later， what can you do in the first part， of the night。

 so that now you're in a good， situation， manage your energy， get yourself into a great。

 fucking mood， and get a bunch of leads， phone numbers， and it's simple habits。

 until the mentality of playing， the win kicks in， okay， so for the next two nights。

 it's like every fucking， girl you have five minutes， like this is the new rule。

 next two nights every girl， and starting to have to， the rest of the night。

 and the first five minutes， I want the answer to those， five questions， I'm be quizzing you on。

 I'm going to pull you out， answer it like， how do they know each other。

 what are they doing tomorrow， how are they going home， you fail to answer one。

 they'll be consequences， maybe a push up， in front of the girl， something， I want to say。

 every single interaction， as well that lasts longer， than two or three minutes。

 you don't leave without， asking for a number， from now on， that doesn't mean。

 ask for two or three minutes， and it means before it ends， that applies。

 for the first part of the night， starting now， no numbers， now you're going， for the pull。

 or the go with， starting now， pulling， or going with the girl， enters the win win， okay。

 now it's the last， three minutes， you don't leave without， asking for a number， from now on， okay。

 now it's like， relatable， now these girls， get what， they're kind of reaching that， climax。

 now what you'll realize too， is right now， your interactions， fun little opens， won't go， as well。

 as earlier in the night， and you'll probably， realize it's like， throughout the night。

 like in the beginning， you can kind of go， into like， hey what's up， and the girl just arrived。

 she's like， oh new people， she's down to kind of chat， to everyone， not anymore， right now。

 the girl's hot， she's looking for that guy， you go up like， hey， a little fun thing。

 no time for that， you'll be dismissed， okay， so keep that in mind， that's the importance of。

 kind of getting yourself， in that really good state， now， but in terms of the opens。

 now just keep it very casual， okay， it's that climax， where it's like， pump her state's pumps。

 now let's find a guy， casually build it up， to the pull， it's not pump， pump， it's endurance。

 go with the blow， so a lot of my opens， now they're still going to be congruent， how I feel。

 but they're usually kind of， hey how's it going？， oh cool， and I'm looking for that long set， okay。

 right now， what do you say your longest interactions， or up until now？， it means tonight？， yeah， uh。

。。， 15 minutes？， 10 minutes， max 15， it's 20 minutes， 10 max 15， 15 minutes？， yeah， 15 20， let's say。

 uh。。。， not enough for a pull， okay， cute， your game could be 10 out of 10。

 if that's the length of your interaction， nothing will happen， you got a double triple quadruple。

 that length， so even now in terms of how you act， and how you go about it。

 how would you act to maintain it an hour， how would you act to maintain it an hour to half。

 yeah you'd slow it down， pace it out， it seems like， pace it out， take your time。

 don't try to go too fast， or you'll become an obstacle to her， okay， this whole win win， is like。

 such a crucial part， such a crucial fucking lot， so much rejection， simply it's not win win。

 you turn into an obstacle， there's a downside， okay， so here we are in the second part。

 we're not ideals， we don't got leads， whatever， but it doesn't mean it's over。

 okay now a trap you may fall into， is now it's the second part of the night， you're like oh shit。

 it's the second part of the night， time to commit， and now you're attached to the outcome。

 now you're not going to want to talk to everyone， you talk to a girl who's not hot。

 you're not going to want to commit either， and that's who this little side note is I mentioned to you。

 get the logistics of every girl hot or not， get the number of every girl hot or not。

 you want to make it a fucking habit， and guess what， even a girl。

 until now you want to make it a habit， and soon I'm thinking about it， it's like every girl。

 so just who you are， you're just always getting the logistics， okay， and， even the number。

 it's like get the girls number， if you don't like her， you can always delete it， but guess what。

 a girl is not attracted， what does she have， probably some attract her friends， you never know。

 maybe she's going to a party later， maybe you invite her out another night， you can use her as a。

 mom to get a hot girl， that's the ideal， so you go out three nights in a row， like we're doing here。

 you get a bunch of leads now， you text them like， all the numbers。

 ideally and we'll do this tomorrow， at midnight 30， you text them one by one， where are you。

 where are you， at the end of the night， if you don't call you call them， tomorrow。

 what you text them， what are you doing tonight， you invite them out tomorrow， the night after。

 you invite the numbers， from tonight， from tomorrow night， the night after， you create this。

 fucked-up ripple effect， it's always rolling， with fucking girls， this here is like playing。

 the paradoxes， the emotional， or the logical， it's tough， this is what's so complicated。

 about it too， it's like it's these subtleties， in the emotional layer， and how the fuck。

 you teach the emotional layer， you can only teach it， by experiencing it， or seeing someone else。

 experience it， you can't fully put it， in the words， that's why all the， content is right。

 but it's only， describing part of it， or it's pointing you， in the direction， it'll never come。

 you know， and it's like， like another one， like a good example， here's another good one。

 making a joke， because you actually， want to make a joke， or making a joke， when it's fake。

 here's the two scenarios， say you're with a friend， you have a cool joke， you want to share。

 with your friend， comes in the moment， joke everyone lacks， now say you're with a boss。

 you want to fucking， promotion， you make a joke， same exact joke， you both laugh。

 the boss laughs too， subtlety in the life， it's those， little nuances， that makes， game， that's it。

 and it's like those， little 0。1%， weeks， do you have， enough things， it's super tough。

 but once you get it， then you fucking， feel it， but it's tough， it's like a lot of。

 it's like finding balance， shit too much， a little less， okay， yeah， we'll get a feel for it。

 and there's a lot， but those laws， are really good， to feel or， to feel， like a guide you， to there。

 okay， but let's kind of， have on this， claim， where's the best， seat at the table， here。

 why are you scanning， the environment， so a couple of things， just right now， don't get shoved。

 your head with that， outcome， you only difference， is you're talking， everyone， have an equal。

 much fun with everyone， but once you fall， on a girl， you find attractive， with logistics。

 you're not looking， for easy logistics， you're just making sure， it's not impossible。

 logistics are going to be， fucked all the time， it's always going to be， shitty logistics， okay。

 but you have to make， that decision， and when you make， that decision， take your time， long sets。

 and you're going to counter， a lot of resistance， wanting to bounce out， early。

 it's going to be messy， you're going to get maybe， a little tired， you're like， oh。

 do I really want to， fucking see if I can walk this， go back to her place， maybe I should。

 drive the back to Hollywood， and pass out， no， you can commit， you can make you go all， out。

 you get that epic story， either pull， or something crazy， happens， you're trying for a pull。

 but I want a long set， that's the mission now， I want a 45-minute interaction。

 to hopefully go somewhere， another catchphrase， to kind of keep in mind， is when you open。

 always match their reactions， so notice that you jump in， and the open was good， you go up。

 but they're like kind of， tense， it's like kind of surprise， like， oh shit。

 and then you lean in more， and they lean back， lean back as well， always just match it， from there。

 you were talking， it was good， it was a lot more gentle， but it was still a lot of， doing， well。

 boom， so you kind of know， it's like， okay， they're having fully， hooked， they're set back。

 and then you're like， did it， did it， did it， doing， not inspiring， so one thing you'll see me do。

 and this is important for you too， is I'm talking to a girl， and say it doesn't， hooked like that。

 I'm like， hey， did it up， and she's like， huh？， she's like a little， jolt in the way， I'm like。

 like that， like I'm kind of just like， laugh， and like just like， shake up those， posse emotions。

 within myself， and then it draws them in， so little challenge here， make me laugh without doing。

 make me laugh， yeah， notice， just in the eyes， you're like， you're trying to do。

 how do you make me laugh， you just genuinely make， yourself feel those emotions。

 you want me to feel， so it's you doing to you， you can't do to me， you have to do it to you。

 and like actually， something that authentically， maybe laugh， I feel forced， you wouldn't be saying。

 okay if you actually were， like laughing， you can also talk， you can do whatever， make me laugh。

 whatever you want to do， make me laugh， make me laugh， so he's like， anything I say at this point。

 I feel like I'm going to try， so I'm trying to like not try， and you're still trying， yeah， exactly。

 with this one here， I'll do it sometimes， putting you in this role here， it's most impossible。

 you do it， it's one of those， like heck you laugh， and it's like， no way I can do it， like that。

 but what's good about it， is that that question， like that challenge， brings fucktons of awareness。

 to the doing versus， inspiring， you're like， holy shit， how do I， I'm doing it， it's like it fucks。

 to do ahead big time， there's a guy in Vegas last week， he's actually， doing it tonight， same thing。

 like make me laugh， and it's like， actually like， okay， how the fuck do I， I summon。

 he's like really good emotions， inside me， and it's like authentic， I can't even force。

 like the summoning， it's like， super top， it's like that getting in touch， with the internals。

 just for you， and， even letting go， and this is how， fuck to this， letting go of the outcome。

 of me laughing， because that's， you can feel good， and then you're like， okay。

 you're laughing a bit， and then you're looking， like， perfection， but whenever it's like。

 that it's like， be very aware of the， doing， and start associating， the doing， with like， disgust。

 you're like， ah， doing， inspired， okay， take， you can do tests as well， like you talk to the girl。

 take a step back， see if she'll lean in， if not， she's not inspired enough， you want that。

 magnetic effects， that's really the value， that's in a way too， if you see me， do like。

 sometimes these bushes， and shit， and the girls stay， but， yeah， you have the mind， underlying。

 it's not the bushes， to make them do it， it's like， I think we want more of that。

 this is the foundation， so what happened？， I mean， I tried to， pull it outside。

 the club three different times， okay？， in that case，， plan B， go with it， yeah， yeah， now。

 let me ask you this， these are best friends， you befriend them， did you win them over？。

 he likes you， he wasn't talking to you， there， so why were you chatting him？， he was like。

 I wasn't chatting him， at a point where， she stopped to talk to the mouse， and he was like。

 I'm standing here， and I just kept standing， no， game the guy， even here walking。

 he should be talking to the， fucking guys， if he likes you， that's your end， your goal。

 gets to the bed， gets to the bed， if she's like， oh my god， he keeps talking to me。

 it's uncomfortable， just game the fucking guy， he loves you， it's awesome， and it just gives her。

 these are fucking best friends， love you， great， she's best， she's so much， all you have to do is。

 just stick on the fucking guy， she's talking to the bouncer， game the guy， with a pull。

 and this is big， you can't be， always just one-on-one with a girl， especially the going with。

 it's like， for a whole group， better fucking love you， and you'd be better， be one。

 like bounce off for a couple of minutes here， and there are no fucking friends， remember。

 energy has nothing to do with it， don't put all that energy in the first half。

 and a lot of your game is energy， by the way， be careful with that， it's a lot of。

 second-minute with energy， it can work but second-minute with positivity。

 because the energy will burn you out， because yeah， it's like so much， and I get like。

 and probably here you're thinking， okay， I got to open him， and I got to bring that energy back。

 you don't， just think， just realizing that， it's like so much， you don't have to bring the energy。

 hey， what's up， okay， especially with Levi， it's like， hey， what's up。

 he's probably already on the set， you don't have to do anything， just as you go on， yeah， chill。

 yeah， and think for the poll here， endurance plus logistics， endurance plus logistics。

 it's not doing anything， it's just enduring it till， either they go with you。

 or you go back to their place， okay， but I want to end up， a big story for tomorrow。

 and remind yourself of this too， don't know what'll happen。

 until you're in bed at the end of the night， right now you can be like this， you go in， bang。

 open the hottest girl fuck her， that'll happen a fuck ton， you don't know， okay， so。

 epic story tomorrow， thanks a lot， appreciate it， good shit， epic story tomorrow。

 let it burn。
