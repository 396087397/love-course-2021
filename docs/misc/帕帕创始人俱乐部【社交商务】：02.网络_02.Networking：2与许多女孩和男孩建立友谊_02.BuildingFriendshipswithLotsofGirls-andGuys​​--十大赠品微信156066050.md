You do this naturally，when you're like a little kid，Just say you wanna play ball。

 or you wanna do whatever，and a lot of people forget those skills，when they become an adult。

You had so important today，Sough in when you're at educational events。

because then you have a lot of people，who are，educational events，you have the same kind of mindset。

when you're an RSD，your mind is typically about education。

A lot of you are probably reading a lot of books，you look at guys like Tyler。

Tiathor will read new books，almost every day，是啊 但是我不懂，如果这是果几个章，的时候不一定，你说 你真的需要，已经有些人继续，说陆拯立装补，大家觉得。

見江洋人，聽起來，很多人，你想得自己這樣， Most of the times， sometimes you're not home and you're sharing that landline with your whole family。

， Nowadays， I don't even know people who really have a landline。， They usually have a cell phone。

 not even have a cell phone，， they're connected to the email。

 they're social media connected to multiple social media。， And I think it's very。

 very useful to try to maximize your ways of contact with your phone。， For example。

 if I'm using my phone， I have access to a telegram group。

 where I can contact all my customers and clients。。

 I have access to multiple settings of chats where I can contact people like Skype。。

 I have my phone organized by people， by city， by interests。， And I even have a combination there。

 like people who are in Las Vegas， that are interested in playing golf with me。

 which is like a new passion。， And I think that using your phone that way can help you sort your life。

 and kind of access a planner。， Nowadays， I'm playing golf a lot。。

 Not just because golf is a skill set that I thought was cool for network。

 but also because I wanted to get mastery over a topic that I viewed as。

 the most difficult thing to start and the most difficult sports you could play。

 and still do something athletic。， So when I know I have a blog， I'm tracking the 10。

000 steps to mastery。， Like Matt and Gladwell says， take 10，000 steps to mastery。。

 So I create a golf site， it was called CokinghamGolf。com，， where I'm tracking my golf progress。。

 And I think that's very useful for you to do， to have some kind of a goal。

 or setting you could have。， On the other hand， going back to the topic of organizing your contacts and management。

， I used to do that so hard core that I would use discussion boards as forms。， Back in the day。

 we didn't have a law of social networks。， I think we had my space just coming out。。

 And then back in the day， I was using things like MSN network groups， or Yahoo network groups。。

 And then I have conversational topics and discussion board threads relating to cities。。

 And in that city that have a discussion board where I met people。

 and I talk about all the people I met。， Because I meet so many people。

 must be my short-term memories， really short。， But one of the ways I was able to remember what I talked about with these people。

 and who they were， whether it was just where， was to put that in there。。

 Now I actually do it even in my phone。， Everything from who the person is， what your interest is，。

 things we talked about to places we might have traveled to， mutual friends we have。。

 If I look at somebody's name in my phone，， I've even sometimes accidentally dialed some other people。

 because I have them listed as friend of this person， X。， And I'm trying to call that person X。。

 I think that organizing your network， organizing dinners，， organizing casual meets is so important。。

 I was so interested in doing this and so much isn't going to other people's events。。

 I developed the Yes mentality， which is I would always say yes to everything。。

 Even if it was just to go out for five minutes to go to a bar，， go to a lunch， go to a dinner。。

 And I'd even do it so hardcore。， I might even go to three， four， five dinners in a night。。

 Not very eat， just to hang out， just throughout the night。。

 Or even do the same thing for drinks with random and kind of like， non-interacting social groups。

 not intersecting social groups。， Just like keep in touch with all these different groups。。

 I'm pretty non-judgmental overall in terms of who I want to hang out with。

 as long as there are people that have that overall positive attitude。

 and are people that are kind of fun。， They're not out there just to seek something from you。。

 They're just there to have fun。， And I think that building on those common interests is so important because of that。

， When you're involved with RSD for example，， I think a lot of your conversational set will be on random topics。

， especially when you're meeting girls who might not have the same topics of you。。

 But when you are trying to transition，， do that relationship transition and you're wanting to develop those。

 deeper meaningful relationships as opposed to a cold pickup。。

 I got into it because when I first got into pickup，。

 my goal wasn't interested in just picking up girls。。

 It was interesting actually getting a girlfriend。， That was my New Year's resolution。。

 Many years in a row and I first got into pickup。， In fact。

 I got into pickup because there was always like a girl。

 that was in my soul circle that I couldn't get。， And a law that had to deal with not having those common interests。

， common values， common entalities，， or if they were girls that I thought were just way pretty，。

 I didn't have those conversational topics。， And so by having that breath，。

 I was able to develop those conversational topics and interests， and go deeper into that。。

 But I think that more importantly in relationship building，。

 like getting a long-term relationship as opposed to a short-term， when I stand relationships，。

 is developing those common bonds， common interest， common social circles，。

 and common attitudes and morals。， The most important thing I think as a foundation for most relationships。

 is having those common values and morals。， So when we were looking for people to hire into the corporate culture of RSD。

， we were looking for certain kind of people that have the same kind of like， brother ship。

 same kind of pods of attitude for learning，， same kind of a fast-paced lifestyle and goals for excitement。

， that coolness factor。， And I think a law that happens in the same thing in relationships。。

 Funny thing is same thing happens in friendships。， And when I stand， it's more about the adventure。。

 But I think a law that will also come down to this as well。

 because a lot of people will turn those one-night stands into long-term relationships accidentally。

 and sometimes they'll do it on purpose。， And that could be done with a lot of the skills you learn from not just the game skills。

， but the transfer those game skills into the socializing skills。。

 Carefully manage your time with a planner and Google counter，， though。

 because if you're in this pickup lifestyle，， you have probably done a lot of approaches。。

 Just starting off as a newbie， I think you do hundreds of approaches。。

 If not thousands of approaches within a year or two。。

 And if you get to the point where you're looking at RC instructors，。

 you do tens of thousands of approaches。， Your calendar， your Google contact，。

 is going to be very difficult to manage。， So I used to manage my schedule very， very。

 very carefully on a planner。， I bought it at a bookstore，， running with a pen and paper。。

 Now I have to use electronics， so I use it in a phone。， Now， whatever you guys use，。

 just make sure you're managing your time very carefully。
