 I really want to illustrate this， The resistance that comes up， You know。

 if you are someone who is into self health， and really into it。

 You are going to experience a lot of， resistance to me saying， drop self health。

 Because just to get into it， It is a big fucking leap， It is you admitting， ok， I need to work。

 sitting somewhere in the basement， nobody is like looking at it， it's kind of deteriorating。

 you got to buy some， my potential to do stuff， to hustle， to what， Why is that bad？。

 Because I feel like I wanna do the best， I wanna get the best out of it。

 You're still on the surface， You're just flying， like well， I feel like you know。

 I won't be using it， Why？， because I feel like I wanna be using， No go deeper。

 What's so bad if you don't use it？， The universe is like， you'll never reach your potential。

 What's so bad about that？， Why？， Like I'll probably，如果這樣，我告訴你，，但如果這樣，，我會想像到，我感覺到，我的勞力，，想說，你會做到你的生活。

為什麼你需要做到自己的生活，為什麼你需要做到自己的生活，因為你會做到自己的生活，但為什麼你需要做到自己的生活，因為我希望要做到自己的生活，你去世上，你需要更多，你覺得， 什麼名字，或是。

 sowie media candy to you， booring shit，I don't wanna be in there，Why，I wanna shoot for the stars。

 Why， You keep going in circles，why？，why？，Because It makes me happy，But why do you need to do that。

To be happy，It's really difficult， Display，No shit，That's where you gotta go deep。

 Use this opportunity， of the crowd， like this， to force yourself， to go， in introspection mode。

 Cause this shit here， until， you confront， whatever you're， Fuckin' running away， it's endless。

我真的記得，因為肉 Player，她最前幾年，偷偷吃白的一兩個，一人說，如果那群人，對甚麼是可怕，然後要別人，對身體的阿宇，任何人都不肯接種，就既然他沒回事，反正你們小孩子，哪有，你因為這麼高。

傾婚出席，問妓女，你嘴巴，我不知道，男性尚小，到底不親錯，反正，就会在这里，那完全不是，的话，就专心地拿住，是，就是这样，造态，你们和我们，混镜，请一个，想好，专心的，分数，2，我们，专心的，当然。

你们，没有，有什么方案，这样，我们 driver，我可以，你 after all this resistance， where I'm like why？， Why？， Why？， Why？， Why？

， You know， just keep pressing on it， Finally it's well， I don't want to disappoint my parents。

 I want my parents approval， You know， And this can be extremely common， by the way where。

 if you have parents who have， like perfectionist standards， like as a kid， you must be perfect。

 must always get the best grades， it'll carry into your adulthood。

 where you're still trying to be perfect， and if you're honest with yourself。

 it's you're trying to meet， those perfectionist standards， that your parents have。

 and you have to let go of that， you know， let go of like， what happens if you don't meet them。

 what happens if you disappoint your parents， and then do the process， Good， Now we're going deeper。

 BHD， my mom is a judge like， a judge like me， Okay， It's good， No， that's good， It's good， Yeah。

 there's a thing， A very high expectations for me， and I have also for myself high expectations。

 Okay， I don't want to be stuck like in the middle， You know what I'm saying， Okay。

 I'm maybe not like， digging deeper what you mean to say but， Well， take into it now。

 Say you disappoint them， Picture that， Picture your worst fucking fear。

 Like you disappointing your parents， and it like just， the thing they really don't want。

 you do that， What emotions thoughts like， What kicks in， Don't judge it， Don't give a story just。

 What kicks in， How do you feel？， Kick in， Like sad movie， Hahaha， Something like that， It's um。

 I don't know the anxiety of like， Not not having made it you know， How does it feel？， Ah。

 Such an unpleasant feeling， You're in heart you know what I'm saying。

 So that's really what he has to， dive into， It's directing him to that。

 and then of course you can keep on， going deeper and deeper and deeper， Ah。

 let's get into another example， Yeah， Woo， Applause， Thank you， So man， Thank you， Hahaha。

 It feels like really unreal， Hahaha， Good， I know， Okay， You can hear my nervousness。

 I think it's all comes from， I have like， Like you know the art of accomplishments。

 I think I could summarize the best， from like watching， It was like one RST motivation video。

 It was like， It's like you have to go to the end， And I were at the die， If I'm not succeeded， Yeah。

 Yeah， Okay， So that always go go go go， Yeah and it's like the same now， Like you know。

 If I don't like perform， Like to the top at the moment， You know。

 If you embarrassed yourself in front of this crowd， Yeah but it's not like the embarrassment。

 Because I don't know， Even though I feel like really， Like inside and nervous。

 I know like I mean you know， Save hands， I don't think it's not so， Hahaha， Okay。

 What are you working on accomplishing right now？， Like school， relationship， like business。

 Working out， Like all type of you know， The typical self improvement areas。

 Always trying to maximize it， And I know it really comes from you know， A lot of like scarcity。

 And I went through like a you know， Minute depression， the spring， Coming from like。

 All this and I got stuck， In all these mental structures， And even being like a cold shower。

 30 seconds or one minute longer than the plant， It's just like。

 You know I just that's downward spiral， Like everything， And if I don't like make all my time boxes。

 Or going up in like the specific time， It only aspires enough， Okay， I like that。

 Very like a compulsive perfectionist， So another self help junkie here。

 And what's really interesting with this， Is that you're obsessed with improving in self help。

 Is that you do start having your own best interests at heart。

 You know you do start becoming more healthy， Like here's the guys on top of his health， His diets。

 business， relationships， Like he's doing everything right。

 But it's still coming from the wrong place， You know it's still compulsive。

 It's that compulsive perfectionist， And he's aware of it， You know most people are not。

 Most people are like just head buried in the sand， Just continuously obsessive。

 And he's like hey I realize it， And I realize that I have this compulsive need， To do everything。

 And if I just miss one little thing， It's a downward spiral， You know， And this will happen。

 You'll catch yourself， Like for me， I remember when I first started getting into health supplements。

 Like vitamins， You know what？， Well there's all these benefits I didn't know of。

 And I started with some basic ones， Like you know what？， Let's just get some of vitamin D。

 some fish oil， A multi and some probiotics， But then slowly but surely you kind of get sucked in。

 And you're like well now there's also this， Now there's also this， now there's also this， this。

 this， this， And suddenly I had this huge fucking stack of vitamins， And if I just missed one。

 Like one vitamin， Like am I really going to notice a huge difference。

 If one day I just miss one out of all of them， No， But in my mind I'm like fuck， The day is fucked。

 You know so you just keep adding more and more and more， And now there's like more to maintain。

 And if you just miss one you're done， You know， With self help you find out about it。

 And the more you get into it's like well I have to do this now， But I also have to do this。

 I have to do this， I have to have my time boxes， And this and this and this。

 And it just becomes too much， And then eventually you miss it。

 And it's like a downward spiral from there， Okay so it's the place it's coming from。

 Be careful not to use self help， Is all these new reasons to beat yourself up。

 And hate yourself because you're not living up to them， And again he's at this peak of like。

 Optimize the paradigm， That's like a sign you're at the peak by the way。

 And you're at a point here where you really have to let go of it， And I'm really aware of it。

 And I'm trying to work on it all the time， Watching all the videos。

 Meditating a lot but it's just from the scarcity， Because I'm meditating to accomplish something all the time。

 And you're running away from you， Disapproving yourself and beating yourself up， Yeah。

 Yeah that's interesting， This will happen like， When you first find out about for example being。

 Meditating or being present to the moment， Or being in a higher state of consciousness。

 Every time you're not， You feel like shit， No， I'm not present to the moment， Or hey be productive。

 What happens if you relax a bit， Just watch a movie， I'm slacking off。

 I had that when I actually first started touring， It was when the first。

 No I've been touring a bit before， But I remember specifically there was this movie， The Avengers。

 The first one that ever came up， I was in Austin， Texas with Owen。

 And he's like oh you know it's pretty good， I just went to a similar wind up。

 Just go relax watch a movie， And yet I was at the movie and I just couldn't enjoy it。

 I hated every fucking second of that movie， Because I'd be sitting there。

 And I'm like I'm wasting two hours， Where I could be productive， I couldn't be productive。

 And you just like can't slow， It's like you're just hooked on it。

 So you know the obvious question here is， What happens if you just don't。

 Like what's so bad about not being perfect， What's so bad about waking up late。

 And you're like what's so bad about not being successful。

 What if right now every thing you're trying to accomplish， You fail， Well it comes up。

 Like visualize it， Everything you're trying to accomplish you just fail。

 It just feels like I would live like a lesser life， In the end or in the end。

 Who would you disappoint， I think of myself， But also like the surrounding。

 I really want to live up to all the society's expectations。

 And I don't know like the Renaissance man or whatever， You know why， Because you get this mental。

 From the self-improvement conditioning， Like the optimal life is when you achieve all those stuff。

 What if it's the opposite， Yeah I know it is the opposite， And that's the thing you know。

 But it's so hard to， Let go or whatever you know， So this example here again he's aware of it。

 He knows it， He mentally consciously knows it， However what he needs to do here is。

 Actually do the fucking process， Consciously knowing about it， Is better than not knowing about it。

 But it won't really change shit， You know you need to dive into it， Let it go。

 Go through the experience， And of course dive into your subconscious and let go of that。

 Until you do nothing will change， So for you it's， What I'd recommend doing。

 Because I was very fucking similar， Like I was like hustle a hundred percent。

 And you know it doesn't hustle a little pussy， A little bitch you better hustle all the time。

 So the fuck up through excuses like， Boom like that， And you know another easy。

 Like another way we kind of rationalize this by the way is， By taking on the pain。

 And taking on the suffering， And kind of viewing ourselves as like the martyr hero， I did that。

 Like I was traveling around like same on my first tour， When I was like。

 I worked myself into the fucking ground， And I remember like， I was lying in bed one morning in。

 Montreal， And there's this clip from Breaking Bad， Where there's this one scene。

 Where he says you know I'm not in the， Was it money business？ I mean the empire business。

 Something like that， I was like that's epic， You asked me。

 If I was in the meth business or the money business， Neither， I'm in the empire business。

 I literally like was lying in bed for like， 30 seconds， And I'm like yes， I'll take the pain。

 I'll take the travel， I'll take the workload， I don't care， I'm the fucking like I'll take it。

 Because I'm the fucking hero in this， Like I'm the martyr， I'm like Jesus on the cross， Type shit。

 And it's very easy to take that， It's like yeah your perfectionist。

 For anyone who's like always workaholic or striving， What am I， So it's kind of being aware of it。

 Which you are and what I'd say now is， Really reflecting on， And just diving into whatever comes up。

 When you ask yourself like what happens， If I don't， If right now like say tomorrow you wake up。

 And I'm like don't， I'm assuming you heard the gym， I'm like don't go to the gym。

 Don't go to the gym eat this shitty food， Does guilt kick in what kick， It's like shh。

 Whatever sensations pop up， It's tuning into that， So give yourself a little challenge。

 Like next time you really feel like， Oh I need to do this。

 Give yourself a challenge and simply don't do it， Not not all the time obviously。

 Like what you did here is like， You've really optimized that paradigm。

 You know it's like you're working so hard to which， Optimize in that paradigm。

 And you want to give yourself a little couple glimpses， Like what happens if I don't。

 And it's not simply just not doing it， It's being aware of what comes up， Sensations， feelings。

 tune into that， And start releasing them， Start breathing through them， Similar to what we did here。

 Misery is the first teacher don't let it be the last， You know it's like you've used it。

 Probably like to get that jump start， But as you see now it's very limiting。

 And it's not sustainable in the long run， Like anyone who's like on this route of like。

 Like obsessive like that， Eventually will fucking crash， And it's really interesting。

 But it couldn't because it wasn't really until， Because when you're living alone it's really easy to just。

 If you have like bad emotions or whatever， Just to grab another book or just hustle even more。

 But when you have like a girlfriend， And she wants you know to watch the fucking movie or something。

 It's a。。。， You don't really only affect yourself， But you affect her as well and she can really feel like。

 Really energies and you know， I like to drop that out that's interesting。

 So it all comes to the surface because， You can't really just suppress it with like another productivity。

 Or whatever， Yeah that just for you something in me。

 Actually so I was talking about that first tour， I was doing this on towards the end of that first tour。

 It wasn't a girl but it was a guy， Sorry traveling with me， My buddy does like a lot of marketing。

 And I remember specifically， It was right after the pimple launch， And if you guys see pimple。

 my product， Yeah so I launched pimple and I was like， I like through the ground to do that。

 It was insane like I'd be like running bootcamp， To like three sleeping till six。

 Like three hours and editing， It was just horrible， And we were in Miami。

 And Owen and I are both very just like， Hustle like take action hustle。

 And at the time we were like even more， You know it's like now。

 I don't know if you've been aware of， We've been bringing a lot more of this art of enjoyment。

 Into our videos like it doesn't take away from the hustle， We hustle harder now than ever。

 Because it's coming from the right place， But at the time we were just like， Like head down。

 And I remember my buddy saying it's like dude， Let's take a night out just fuck around。

 Let's take a night out just go out and enjoy ourselves， And we'd go out and even when going out。

 I'm like well let's go talk to girls， That's good it's like no dude。

 Let's even do a night where you just don't talk to girls， And just fucking vibe。

 And I was like ah there's like， I must open like that and you see girls walk by。

 It's like I must open it's like no dude， Like slow it down and enjoy it。

 And then I'd be there and I'm like thinking of the future。

 Like how long until I can do an open and hustle， No like that。

 And he even said it's like dude it's like， You're going so far down this hustle route。

 And it's like really it's even connect with people around you， You know and this is huge。

 You know the more of a perfectionist you are， You think you're going to be perfect。

 Been reality you turn into this robot， You lose your humanity if you will。

 You lose what makes you perfect， Trying to be perfect by doing so。

 You lose what makes you perfect by default， You know you think it's productive。

 You think it'll help but in reality， You'll lose touch with who you are。

 You'll hate yourself and you'll lose touch with people。

 Around you okay this is not the way that's not how you get there。

 And that's like advice for anyone who's like super workaholic， Like head down hustle。

 It's like if you are actually just more aware of the people around you。

 And more friendly and social， You'll realize you'll get way further ahead。

 Because by you having your head down with the hustle hustle hustle hustle。

 You're cultivating this really like anxious in a way， Negative vibe that repels a lot of people。

 And your head so far down that you're like blocking off all this opportunity。

 So that's what I had and you even said， You're losing touch with it。

 You know it's like even look at you look at fucking。

 Oh and it's like you're both moving down this direction， You know and talked about it too。

 You went to a basketball game there and you just couldn't enjoy it。

 And Jeff told me like dude enjoy the fucking game。

 You know it's like there's that like resistance around it。

 And our relationship will do the same thing， Like anyone who's like a workaholic hustle。

 You'll never have like those long relationships， You'll never be able to vibe。

 And it's this other skill here like learning how to sew it down， Learning how to connect。

 Learning how to connect， It's like you don't have to put all that pressure on yourself。

 You don't have to be so gold driven so gold oriented， So outcome all the time， It's fine。

 That's like the hardest part， So that's what I'd kind of like bring my awareness to。

 It's like sit down and just ask yourself， You know next time like give yourself a little challenge。

 Like I really need to just know， Okay just not see what happens。

 You know schedule in like some time， Where you just fuck around， See what comes up。

 Trust me man it's like once you kind of drop this， And inspiration kicks in it's like it's awesome。

 You know and it's like， And it's authentic too it's like you'll also know like。

 Sometimes you know it's like you'll be inspired to get action。

 And then you will and sometimes you just won't， But it's totally fine but it's like you no longer have to like。

 Always force yourself and I was be paranoid， Because you're living in the state of paranoia。

 But then also be honest with yourself and being careful with this one。

 To not fall the opposite route， Where now you're like oh no I'm always I need to make myself relax。

 And that's like rationalization， And then you're slacking off。

 But you can always just look at how you feel， Because like you'll always be honest with yourself like emotionally。

 Or like gun to the head it's like， You know is it a rationalization。

 Like if you're authentically like you're inspired to relax。

 You'll feel good about it until you go a little too far， And then you start feeling bad about it。

 It's like if you say a joke the first time it feels very authentic and fun。

 You can still say it a few times but after a while it kind of switches。

 Because that shift where now it's like， And try hard is coming from a different place。

 And this last point here is big， It's like you have to let go of that resistance to not doing。

 But you also have to let go of the resistance to doing， When that inspiration kicks in。

 And this is what happens with people who procrastinate。

 You know it's like they feel that inspiration， Kick in to do something but then they resist it。

 So let go of that and then let go of the need to always be doing， Just follow inspiration。

 And be in this total state of non-resistance， Externally but also internally。
