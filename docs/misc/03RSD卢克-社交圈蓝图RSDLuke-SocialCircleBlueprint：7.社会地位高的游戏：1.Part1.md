# 03RSD 卢克 - 社交圈蓝图 RSD Luke - Social Circle Blueprint：7. 社会地位高的游戏：1. Part 1

我的 goal after this talk，是因为你们有那么多东西，可以做的，那它会做到很多的事，那很好的东西，你不需要做，80%的东西，你只要做20%的东西，我说的东西，它会做的很好的东西。

你不需要做的东西，我只是给你们，因为有些人在这里，要想要做的东西，所以我给你们做的东西，如果你们就把东西做到东西，然后做了很多东西，那很好的东西，我告诉你们，就是你能做什么东西，并是你要做什么你能做。

你也能玩ест，你看这个所有东西，今天 真的还挺好，我最覺得说完了，因为他们有计辖囍�，然后 Ryu，然后他跟我们总体，很多东西都要ww，我说 他们不是張高，毀然是 Musik，之前我就说。

和整个东西都要，因为你们没有被准备，没有继续的东西，他会绢我，那我的高佐，！！！！！，和尝材，和视野，你想说 Mini，Just這樣还是很公那种操场，但是现在 你迈心中，你是怎么回来 我们。

 się获得很高，就是场上，I'm like C2，and I'm stuck at honor titty，So you tell me what's more sexual， right？。

 So you know there's this thing you can， you can understand。

 I mean I'm going to wrap up your question with this， you employ any of these techniques。

 even just one of them， it's just going to make your regular game better， right？。

 I'm not saying it's either or， it meshes together very， very nicely。

 You can even take this stuff I'm saying， and just cold approach now。

 live and always be able to get in for free， You can cold approach now or wick in L。A。。

 always getting for free， just literally throw it in the mix， or you can take it to the next level。

 and you could never cold approach another girl， and the rest of your life。

 and have girls just being sent over to your house， my buddy Michael， and we heard Michael。

 he's got a couple of videos with me and Owen， I mean he plays video games all day。

 and his girls just sent over to his house， like he's got his door unlocked。

 he just plays video games， and girls like stunning stunning girls， I mean 9s and 10s。

 we'll just come over to his house， and then he'll fuck and then they leave。

 he'll fuck and then they leave， he just like he'll pause his video game， to go fuck them。

 he's like addicted I don't really play video games， I don't really understand it。

 but he's just addicted to video games， Mom he's taking this to like a very extreme level。

 I mean he walks into the nightclub， there's 40 girls with him， 30 girls maybe。

 all wearing matching outfits， I recorded this product two and a half years ago。

 way before I was actually with RSD， but I didn't really have the technology back then to do it。

 I didn't really have the know how， so I saw it about six months ago， I knew I wanted to release it。

 because I've been teaching these concepts， for at least four years， to the point where sometimes。

 I'd actually go and live in a guy's city， and I would do all this for him。

 without him actually opening one set， I would just build a social circle。

 I took out six to eight clients a year before I was with RSD。

 and I would just build them that social circle in that city， it was fun for me。

 because I basically got paid to game， and I didn't really love teaching back then。

 I just kind of wanted to game， so it's kind of like a good way。

 for me to not have to go back to writing software， and still kind of perfect。

 the social circle building stuff， so it's cool， but I've been friends with Owen。

 for basically that entire time， just kind of doing my own pickup business long the way。

 and we've basically found a really good agreement， where I could record this stuff。

 and get out to you guys， so some of it's already in the product， the product's already complete。

 but I decided for the next several weeks， every Saturday of boot camp。

 I'm going to record some additional content， see if there's anything else I want to get out there。

 and kind of give you guys some， I guess this is what 50% extra time， I guess on the hot seat。

 so that'd be kind of cool I think right， sweet， if we have time。

 I'm going to go through some hot seat footage， that is all social circle hot seat based。

 I have open to clothes， hot seat， I've open to clothes， social circle footage。

 I have open to clothes， threesome with my girl， I have open to clothes， threesome with no girl。

 just me， I have like basically every combination， you can kind of think of within a social circle setting。

 I think one of the big things I think you'll find， is that a lot of guys who are apprehensive。

 to an indirect style of game， or a social circle style of game。

 is they feel like it might be slower， or it puts them in friend zone。

 or it kind of gives them a situation， that they already didn't really want。

 and something that I think is beneficial， to look at the footage。

 is it gives you a really good idea of how， that's just not true， I definitely would say。

 I wrote a couple of RCNation posts， early this morning about it。

 I would definitely say that my game， is probably the most sexual RCD right now。

 maybe not the most intense， I think Tyler definitely would get that award。

 he's definitely the most intense， in terms of just like sexual deviancy though。

 I don't think anybody else in RC at this point in their life， is at that point that I am。

 so I think that that kind of gives you a good， understanding of where I'm coming from。

 maybe I have any questions about， anything social related yet， before we get started， completely。

 so I'm gonna give you a few like high level overviews， of my version of social circle game。

 and then I'll also give you some really brass tax， specific tangible things you could do。

 with the next few hours of leaving today， basically， because I think it's kind of a waste of time。

 I'm the opposite of the Glenn type coach， I'm on a long journey to be spiritual。

 but I think it's a little bit longer journey for me， than most people。

 so all the advice that I give， is very feed on the ground， brass tax， tangible。

 at the end of the day you'll have at least， 15 to 20 specific things you go to tonight。

 and I imagine you have no social circle at all， you could just start those things right away。

 so I think it'll be beneficial， I think the biggest challenge for me。

 in creating this is making myself kind of relatable， because every time I post anything at all。

 I get all these comments of Luke Bragging， and Luke Boasting。

 and then I mean obviously it's the guys that are kind of。

 you know the there's a funny quote which is， you know you raised your son really well。

 if he grew up to make YouTube videos， and then you know you grew up to fail as a parent。

 if your son ends up making YouTube comments， on YouTube videos right。

 because the comments section is just like the most， in city， just the most disastrous place。

 ever on YouTube video comments， it's crazy these people that live on there， it's so funny。

 and there's no like weight system to know， if anybody's sane or not。

 so like you just kind of take it all as if it's one。

 but anyway the point is I want to really express， that social circle game can be very valuable。

 for whatever you want it to be， it's very valuable in that I've used it， in my work setting。

 to climb work ladders， a lot quicker than I see other people。

 who just put their nose to the grind so on the work hard， especially if you put the social。

 processes in place then if you are already a hard worker。

 you're gonna get a much higher yield for your effort， which that's really the mission statement。

 of my entire way of life， my entire way of game is that for me I don't mind working。

 really hard I don't mind putting on effort into something。

 but I want to have a very high yield at the end of it。

 I don't want to just beat my head against the wall。

 I don't want to feel like I don't know if I'm any better， this week than I was last week。

 so the way this all started is I took my first boot camp， about eight years ago I took the workshop。

 just as a student I was writing software， and I saw the on the Sunday of that program。

 I got my first number close with the help of the coach， and just that one number close。

 it was my first number close ever， and I was like this is something that I want to pursue this。

 it's something that's interesting to me， but very quickly I realized that I was just wasting my time。

 very quickly I realized that every cold approach that didn't land in a lay。

 was just kind of wasted time， because it game is not the zero sum kind of game。

 right you do really well on a girl right now， the girl you're gonna meet an hour from now has no idea that you did well。

 which is kind of obvious， but in our minds we kind of trick ourselves。

 do you guys ever like going to us kind of a streak in a night。

 where you do really really well with when I say， well I mean you get to kind of mid game a lot of girls are laughing。

 you got a couple make-outs， and all of a sudden one girl just blows you off。

 and it just the night just kind of comes to a screeching halt。

 the reason why that happens is because you're almost like an elevated level of state。

 right you're almost too pumped up， but then the girl that you're actually hitting on。

 she has no idea that you just did five really funny banter lines。

 that you just made out of this other girl， right because you're starting from scratch with every new girl。

 and it sounds really obvious， but it's very difficult sometimes to kind of fight our brain。

 when we're in that moment， another thing that I realized is that there's just so much time that's wasted。

 by doing typical beast mode pickup， and you only realize that if you've been in game a little while。

 if you're new to game you're kind of excited by the over sexualized beast mode kind of game。

 right is anybody been there where you know you kind of first realized that it's okay to。

 hand of gods and girls and and Kino escalate， and then the claw and at first few times that works really well。

 you're really excited right because you're like wait。

 this is something I've never really thought I could do before， and now there's no harm at all。

 the problem is I want you guys to realize where this fork in the road kind of happens。

 the fork in the road happens where you decide you're getting results。

 despite your game not because of your game， and that's what happens a lot of physical escalation。

 now when you're employing these social tactics， I'm going to show you you can pretty much still physically escalate。

 but you're doing it from a much different frame than this romantic concept。

 of you actually trying to pick up that girl， I think you were the one that had the question about the D2's right。

 at the free tour yeah， so that question kind of brings up a lot of a lot of my initial points。

 and a lot of the introduction concepts that I want to talk about。

 that whole concept of putting the pressure on the girl， to make the host say no。

 the whole concept of you go up， you escalate really aggressively， you have a lot of presence。

 you go really direct， right I'm just kind of giving you kind of the say or typical。

 direct aggressive kind of pick up artist kind of move。

 right if you are somebody who's a complete beginner。

 and you're not really getting very much success yet。

 that's not going to be your most effective move， because you're not going to know in pinpoint exactly what you're doing well。

 and what you're doing incorrectly， the only way to truly get out of your head is to get in your head for a little while。

 and be analytical about what you're doing， and then break it down from there。

 if you don't know how well you're doing each week， if you're doing better or worse。

 then you're kind of just going to be left stranded。

 and if you guys kind of go game months at a time， not really know kind of really what you're doing or where your road map is。

 does anybody there is kind of still looking for road map。

 yeah the problem with that is that I see guys gaming for years at a time。

 and still not have that road map， they still don't really know exactly where they're headed in the selection process。

 either in their night or with that girl， and I see that because I'll see guys come up to me at。

 150 to AM and they're kind of excited， as if they're starting the night all over again。

 and I'll see them kind of start their opens at 150， and they probably open throughout the night。

 it's happened several times when we were on program。

 a couple of guys came up to me and they're asking me about different types of openers。

 they're asking me what venues we went to， and it was kind of an interesting situation。

 because at that point you should still be in a set， you should be locked into interaction。

 even if it's a terrible interaction， even if it's a set that looks like it's not going to go very well at all。

 you don't really want to keep pressing that reset button。

 unless you're on a bootcamp like a future over here。

 because if you're on a bootcamp the goal is to get as much volume。

 and as possible because it's a compressed amount of time。

 but if you are in a city for three days or longer， if you're in the safe you live here。

 understand that every time you go out every set you open。

 can just build on itself to then allow yourself to do less work in the future。

 and that's really what this comes down to， it was game at the end of the day really should be about leverage。

 and you guys own your own business， and you sort of entrepreneur efforts at all right。

 it's interesting imagine if you took the same kind of lack of process。

 and just through caution to the wind in your business as you do in game。

 this whole just kind of feel it just go by gut instinct。

 your business would never really go that well， your business has to be unemotional。

 your business has to be just this process that runs。

 unless you're in some sort of extremely creative industry。

 your business has to have very strict things that kind of occur。

 if you don't have those things in place with your game life。

 you're going to end up just kind of flailing， it's funny to see you in here because you're going to have a lot of。

 because you worked with Adam a lot right， and Jason a little bit Alex。

 so you're going to hear a lot of similarities， Adam and I came up with this you know。

 entourage game which is funny because Jim， he also he even came up with that way before I did。

 he was on the program which is kind of funny， which is kind of like the start of my social circle building。

 which is essentially you start from a place， if you go out by yourself or you go out with your wingman。

 eventually the end target， the end goal here， is you want to be going out with as many women as possible。

 with as few guys as possible， because that alone is going to build the attraction。

 who here saw my crazy weird snapshot from Sunday night， anybody？ yeah cool。

 have you seen anything more graphic than that or quicker than that on snapchat？。

 Oh the quote was here？， it's L-U-K-E-G-E-R-H-A-R-D-Luke Gerhard。

 the reason I keep mentioning my snapchat is， people talk about infield footage。

 but snap is about as close to live footage you can get。

 without actually putting a Facebook live up right。

 which would be kind of interesting but it's still a little bit glitchy， the snap works pretty well。

 so I want to mention about the snap is， that's pretty much the entire interaction was on my snapchat。

 the reason I mention it is， you don't have to do that much in game。

 you know Julian talks about it's more about， who you are and how you be。

 rather than getting rid of the blockages， rather than all the different steps you take。

 what I'm here to add on top of that is， if you can take just a few key steps to increase your status。

 then what's going to end up happening is you don't have to do。

 almost any of the game concepts that you've been learning， and all of the mindset shifts。

 will just kind of take place without you trying to get them。

 a mindset shift that I'm talking about is a， abundant mentality for example， abundant mentality。

 it's something we can all agree is a good thing， but it's just very vague。

 how do you just go get an abundant mentality， without a big group of girls。

 without having an abundance， it's very difficult to just kind of pretend that。

 or fake it till you make it， at the end of the day that's a very challenging task。

 what we're going to find is when you do the social。

 tactics I'm talking about we're going to do a few different drills。

 I'm going to show you some footage， when you do some of this stuff you're going to have the abundant mentality every time you walk in the nightclub。

 and every time you walk into the club， you're always going to be in perfect state。

 right state to me is something that I never， let my I have a 30 day program in Vegas。

 and we have about 15-20 guys， every month come through it。

 state is something I never let them talk about， because the first day I'll usually see a couple guys。

 spend about an hour or two hours， three hours working on their state。

 and I'm like what are you doing， I'm just hoping that they're kind of running around without really having any sort of plan。

 and your plan can be faulty you don't have to have the perfect plan。

 but you have to go through it with some sort of motion， if you want to build on your success。

 the really the point of social school game， is to increase your success， and decrease your effort。

 that's going to be the theme that I'm covering all， all data right increase that leverage。

 to the point where you don't have to go on more than one date per month。

 and you'll still have five to 15 girls in your life。

 instead of having to go on day two after day two after day two。

 right which if you're really new that seems like a quality problem。

 to go on a bunch of day two is all the sudden， but very very quickly once you realize how to。

 number close and you just realize that's just a couple of tricks to get that number。

 what ends up happening is you end up not really even be able to go on enough dates。

 because you don't have enough time because you're too busy doing other things。

 kind of like what you guys talked about with the goals， a couple nights ago with Owen right。

 so what I'm going to show you is how you can actually day two。

 all the girls that you meet in a either weekly or monthly period。

 I like to do weekly and I like to pick Thursday， so the reason why you want to take a good look at social。

 game really is because it will decrease your time。

 the quality of girl will increase by at least two points almost immediately。

 if you just tell yourself hey for at least a couple weeks， you're not too too week that's all I ask。

 you're not going to do any cold approach layers directly， the quality of girl will just skyrocket。

 it really will， let me have any questions about that so far， cool cool cool go for it。

 what do you have in the college and play where you're getting cold approach layers。

 perfect then you I've caught you at a head of the curve。

 raise your hand if you're not at the point where you're getting cold approach layers yet。

 any like at all they're like sporadically， they're extremely sporadically or not at all。

 like inconsist。。。 super。。。 okay raise your hand if you think you're inconsistent。

 with your layers let's put it that way because that's a better word for it。

 cool cool cool who in here thinks they already have a reasonable social circle。

 not necessarily like full of hotties but like you have friends you have social。

 you know people when you're out right， okay so you said you have a reasonable social circle right。

 when it's in my social circle I do well but I do not。

 so when you do well are you are you closing are you closing from。

 are you closing from the social circle or is it。。。。

 actually I might not have good work I would be able to go to my work， yeah yeah， where is he at？。

 so are you consistent overall， if you include that and you're just inconsisted with cold approach or。

 you have to fail cold approach， yeah yeah so I'm the least from social circle to you have。

 right now I'm not working at this same place， it's dropping， his lead pool fell off。

 yeah yeah so from your work how many girls do you fuck from your work。

 just so we have something to go with， okay so it's still not like a substantial amount right。

 cool so the reason I want to talk about this right is that I want to show you how you can。

 leverage really really simple things so that cold approach almost seems like a waste of time。

 so cold approach ends up becoming like a bar trick that you cold approach because it's fun to do with your buddies。

 it's like a hobby right， really what you have to do is you have to identify what your real goal is。

 you have to identify what type of girl are you after right so you like what type of girl are you after。

 are you right here， yeah I feel like you have some confinuous goals with whom。

 I did do it I don't know what the hell I want， I have to change every time I ask myself that question right now。

 I'm actually working on this girl in my social circle but she's kind of seeing somebody but we hang out all the time。

 we've made out a couple times you know it's like I don't know but I still go out and I'm still single and you know I had a blast last night。

 but I don't really have an objective goal right now， yeah yeah who does have an objective goal。

 Rejren cool about half the room then a little less than half， cool Jare what's yours。

 it's definitely the upper echelon of girls that frankly this is not how you were game is。

 the super ten hotties feel like a better term it's just not really going to work。

 cold approaching them because they will trust you there wasn't me。

 so surrounded with a lot of other girls usually a lot of other guys。

 and so I try to like you know what I was saying on Thursday。

 those girls are kind of just untouchable unless you're in the social circle in the first place。

 exactly yeah yeah I mean you definitely hit the nail on the head there right I think what a lot of people。

 aren't in your position who haven't quite realized that yet I think they don't quite understand that。

 I think a lot of guys who are kind of new think because they see a couple cool videos of cold approach。

 think that what you just said isn't true I think they think that cold approach will just get them any。

 girls they just do it hard enough or well enough and anybody see that or anybody think that right yeah。

 what you find that's just a trap it just doesn't work that way there's a there's a bit of pickup that you have to。

 there's a bit of a it doesn't you know how we talk about Disney fairytale land right with mainstream。

 there's a bit of a pickup Disneyland right which we think that there's certain we you hear one concept that you resonate with。

 and also you run with it you think that this is like the holy grail to solve all your problems and you see a couple little bits of proof。

 that it works right with a cold approach you know infield or hot seat or something and you think that all of a sudden we think that。

 that's true where I think that that one thing is going to work like that all the time and then what ends up happening is the more you game。

 the more years you put into this the more you realize you just can't get 9s and 10s without sociable game just doesn't just doesn't happen。

 purely because you can't get access to them you can't see them it just doesn't really work that way you might have。

 it's kind of like spontaneous little burst of it where you can see them once in a while but there's nothing consistent with it right。

 so you're after the hottest girl you can possibly go after cool who in here is too new to be in that mentality to think that there's。

 just a little bit too new to actually try to go after 9s and 10s right now just try to get experience yeah cool cool cool probably a little bit more。

 more than that yeah what I want you to show what I want to show you guys right is that we're going to use reused。

 Jared as a case study and we're going to show you how you can just bypass this whole like early stage learning。

 and it's like mid-level learning to just go straight to go in after the types of girls that you're trying to go after。

 you don't really have to build up and go I did a talking San Francisco several months ago and you don't have to acknowledge the ugly girls。

 you don't you don't have to fuck your way up you really don't right it's just it's just a fact right I mean。

 no it's funny before I got into game like that's the thing that like people like they literally said it like we always start off with that we go and you'll get hotter and hotter。

 because that's what most people do right and that can work but I'm not going to I'm not going to take a bunch of fucking pick up courses。

 give up a career and tech give up a bunch of other things right to then like fuck my way up of a fatty circle。

 like I'm not going to like it's just there's just no like that's not really the point right I think some guys like have to do that to give。

 them self permission to even get the 90% I agree and I will also I will also add to that that I think a lot of guys just don't know that it's possible。

 right there's a certain bit where before you put in that effort you put in that first step there's a bit of buy in you have to put into knowing that。

 what you're about to do has some chance of working right and when you when you fuck your way up exactly it's a there has to be the strong faith or belief the way about to do is going to work。

 and if you if you don't have that you can just kind of spin your wheels or it might not work or let's say you're in the you have a decent amount of success you're getting like you know six is to eight or nine here and there。

 right and or at least a ten in your city or whatever right and when the ends up happens you can kind of just spin yourself out or go into these like paths where you just kind of get a bunch of you。

 not like what you're saying right where you get the day to is be not really quite closing and I'm sure you're closing plenty like I can just tell from me that you're not exactly you know bad off with women but at the same time I feel like it can just kind of feel like you're bashing your head against a wall sometimes if you get to that point where it's not。

 frustrating to you because your buddies wall look at you and be like wait you're you're closing girls that are hotter than I am you don't have approaching anxiety but you're like wait but I know that I should do better than this right is that make sense if you're not。

 you're not looking up the girls that are hotter than you are then you're wasting your time in game right it's crazy how often I'll see a guy who's looking up the girls that are less attractive than him that are still okay but I'm like looking to do is in shape makes good money dress as well and I'm like you should be like a minimum set like like most guys in this room you should be fucking minimum sevens just because most of you guys are you know six or sevens right if you're going to like look at on like a ten like if ten if ten is like peak there you go think about it right yeah yeah。

 I didn't know that would get you right future future just stormed all the room right huh there you go you know you know what you know it's funny about these ten point scales right and it's silly as it is to like put you on these ten point scales we you know it's these these random units of measure we kind of have to for for conversation purposes right and it's just really funny because nobody looks at five is the median right like when you like when you rate a girl like that's so I mean like and by the way like when I said six and sevens I was being nice because no one looks at five is the median right。

 like it's just not like it's it's it's this like you you don't see a one like a one has a one has one leg right exactly yeah so five five is not the median right so for goal so why won't go show you guys right is you don't have to go for the the screening girls you。

 don't have to just fuck your way through these girls up and down the street and then eventually climb your way up because what's going to。

 happen you're gonna spend two three years in game and you're just gonna increase your lake out you get like 30 to 40 girls you'll pound them out but then。

 when's the happenings you're not actually even close to in those nine or 10 types of girls because you're not even in the same。

 vicinity you're just not even in the same area right because dramatically I think I think I think traditional pick up concepts for a lot of。

 guys in this room you understand a lot of these pick up concepts were made for guys that were less cool than you guys are just。

 starting out you guys ever feel that way like there's certain like you gotta stand like I'm a teacher bootcamp for eight years。

 when I first taught my bootcamp like like it was so much more difficult than teach a bootcamp now like the guys were just。

 completely not just way worse off than you guys and the end what they were expected is way higher like every guy wanted to。

 fuck on the first night like in whether he was a virgin at 30 35 years old he still want to fuck on the first。

 night because he felt like he pay it's like almost like you buy a treadmill you think that you're just getting in shape。

 like people thought they'd like pay their father or is that just people people pay the thing on the bootcamp right and they。

 just thought they're gonna get those results right yeah so like a pivot should be the first word and pick up that you。

 should ever learn you know like you know they say looks don't matter money doesn't matter that shit matters a hell of a lot。

 like I mean it matters a lot right I mean it's it's no surprise that like you know I I'm gonna use。

 damn leader in his name a lot throughout this just because he's like kind of the pinnacle of like we're sociable。

 gamer lia's right I don't think I really have to like argue that with anybody you know it's there's no wonder that he's。

 rich and rips right like sorry like there's plenty of guys who are who don't have I mean he kind of has like every。

 tick in it right it works but that doesn't mean that you have to be those things right clearly I'm you know I'm。

 a kind of an example of that right I mean do you look if you look at me on Facebook I'm like 95 pounds lighter so。

 you know the problem is that my social got too big and I had too many high inclines so like I was able to like。

 have a pick like a pretty good pick up business with zero marketing for five seven years right and I was。

 able to fuck girls that were hotter and hotter each year and I eventually I was just like well this is。

 fun let's just let's just party as hard as these people in my social circle so I kind of got caught up in it。

 right so then I I you know I dated a girl then broke up with a girl and then you know gain the weight。

 back up and down kind of yo yo and then I just along the process though my whole thing is if I'm going to。

 learn something I'm going to learn it fully yeah one thing I use this right I was a terrible software。

 programmer terrible I learned all of my own but I got a degree a software degree in high school。

 and I got a full-time job at like 17 years old writing software for a big tech company right but。

 I was a terrible coder I had no idea what I was doing I just I just would work really hard beat my。

 self beat my head up against the fucking keyboard and work like 60 hours a week and just tell。

 them working 40 and they just think I was like an average coder but it was it was just perfect for me。

 because it was you know it's 17 18 years old they thought I was a lot older it was a cool little setup。

 right so for me I always had the end in mind when I were inside the right software I just want to get。

 off my dairy farm in Wisconsin go to a city where there were girls and I didn't know it was called。

 social circle game but I just want to build a social circle around me where I knew that no matter。

 if I had a bad day because I grew up really depressed right maybe go through depression or anxiety。

 I mean you've got at least be half the room right not even Chris I'm not sitting here being like。

 you know I was at this horrible depression right but just enough for it to actually matter。

 and I realized that I just I wanted to be able to control it I want to control the women。

 or my life I want to be able to control everything in my life I'm going to put effort into it I。

 want to be able to control it and not in this like obsessive kind of way but I want to have。

 options so this one reason why we're going to talk about the whole girl thing right you don't。

 have to just fuck your way up you can pick exactly what your ideal girl is right my ideal girl is。

 you know Jessica Elba in her prime you know Eva Longoria it's I mean my my whole ideal my。

 ideal is some a hike in her prime right I want exactly that type of girl at the end of today's。

 talk you guys want you guys to completely decide what type of girl it is and it can change right。

 it's like a business plan if you don't have a business plan to start out with a marketing。

 mix you're not going to you're going to go very far usually right but it can change all the time。

 so like what you just mentioned right I start with looks because if I don't have looks on point。

 then I'm just not going to be interested in the personality right here's the thing right you go。

 out and you want to go meet a bunch of people how do you organize it how do you structure it。

 it's very easy just go out and meet a bunch of random bouncers but then what do you do with it。

 right you need a system in place now when you contact these people what you do with them。

 and you don't need to live by this system for very long but you have to get started with something。

 okay so what I do is I have a very relatable very tangible amount of people you should meet each。

 night that you go out and what like what point of contact you should have with them and then how。

 often you should contact them I actually have infield of me meeting people randomly and then。

 building it up to the point where they're inviting me to birthday parties they're inviting me。

 to maximum parties playboy parties it's like I just put up a camera while I'm like on the phone。

 with these people and then building up from there because I think that's the biggest challenge a lot。

 of times it's very easy to go get a bouncers name right it's very easy to get a cocktail。

 at your sister's name right but how do you build up into something real I'll show you by the。

 end of the day is talk you know how to get 100% of cocktails as phone numbers 100% of our。

 tenders phone numbers every every hot I mean that you know Scottsdale the hottest girls I've seen。

 with cocktails and bartenders right damn well here in his main girl I bumped into you last night。

 and when you go wakeboarding all the time together I find her to be literally maybe the the。

 number one hottest girl that's not my type of girl I think she's absolutely stunning she works。

 at one of the bars that we go to right all the the bar area that you guys have here I bumped。

 into her and it was it was really funny because she was in the cocktail I was like who's that。

 fucking girl I don't what the fuck because you guys have hot girls we also have a lot of like。

 typical kind of a little above average girls there's like your bars get packed here really really packed。

 so what was interesting is I saw her I was like man I just want to teach you how to get how to。

 get laid with these cocktails and bartenders because here's the thing like yeah personality matters。

 but if you don't have the looks you know if you don't have the attraction to the girl based on。

 her looks then you're not gonna go any further than that right so what ends up happening a lot of。

 guys use this whole personality thing as a way to not actually hit on hot girls I don't。

 see you're doing this but I've seen this a lot where guys will be like oh what's your personality。

 like I want to tell them well where's the hole on a personality like how do you fuck a personality。

 but that's not what I tell them what I actually tell them right that's what I want to say it's not。

 what I say though but what I want to say though is if you can't start with finding out the。

 personality and then work your way backwards then decide on the looks thing right we we just。

 have to filter it all out right you have to you have to value scan if you're gonna live your life。

 you have to value scan but in a way that doesn't affect you negatively do you understand you have to。

 you have to be very careful about oh and talks about this how every pickup concept has two。

 sides of the coin it's almost an opposite effect as well you know how you people say don't value。

 scan don't judge people based on the different things they can do for you I judge people based on。

 what I can do for them and then I sort that out later it's like when I tip people I tip people。

 like 25 to 50 percent everywhere right but I also I mean which sounds great like I tip 50 percent。

 even in Scottsdale here on anything on water on drinks or on food or whatever right the reason。

 why is that tipping 50 percent got me unlimited bottles in Vegas a limited bottles in Miami a limited。

 bottles in New York right the bottom care like 90 percent of time I don't drink once to the。

 Velcro at high that didn't have any alcohol at the table that the snapshot party that I had the。

 other night right I didn't have once to the alcohol at that table but the bill came out to， 11。

500 dollars and then they waived it all because I went in and tipped a bunch of times on。

 random little drinks ahead of time and then built it up from there right but all the guys don't。

 want to do that they don't want to see that the fact that hey you do have to value scan you do。

 have to filter certain things because you only have so much time in the day right totally because。

 nothing's for free right so I'm buying something with that I mean I'm not gonna tip two I'm gonna。

 tip five right now I'm buying some of that five dollars I don't have the money to to actually tip。

 as much as I do I literally look at it like it's a business expense like I'm getting something out。

 of it but I go so far to the point so I'm gonna tell you guys things that you guys can do and。

 I'm also gonna tell you things that are a little bit crazy that I do and if you have the balls。

 or you have the you have the gregariousness to follow through on it you can go for it but so one of。

 those simple things I do for example every night I go out to a nightclub and I'm in nightclub。

 seven days a week right every night I go out to a club I buy a drink for some guy that I think。

 makes a lot more money than me that's my only rule for it that adds up to a lot of money right。

 I can kind of afford that but if it didn't come back on me I couldn't afford it like if it was。

 just random if I was just trying to like spend it it definitely went I'm expecting that to come。

 back on me in a lot of ways right the cool thing it's kind of like you guys are not like VC money。

 works right you guys are venture capital works right it's super simple you know you are it's。

 it's a very it's a very bad bet for the VC company right they're looking for that one home run。

 to kind of pay for all the all the bad companies right all the failures they're looking for the。

 you know they're looking for the for every Chris Sokka there's a bunch of guys on the street corner。

 on Market Street in San Francisco um Market Street's like this you know Market Street is like。

 this zombie fucking apocalypse in San Francisco right um you you you really want to understand。

 this but when I'm tipping that $5 right I'm I'm specifically getting an interaction out of it。

 right um you don't have to see if the $5 either there's a lot of other ways you can do it like。

 if you just are dead broke you can build it up from this but this has gotten me significant like。

 I own part of a makeup store in Vegas I know nothing about makeup I barely ever go to the store。

 right um the money I get from the dividends are like a few hundred dollars a month or something。

 like it's it's such it's so few points it's like nothing right but the point is I can go in and。

 bring any girl and get have her have her makeup it's like one of those places where they can。

 actually have their whole makeup done so I'll tell girls on dates I have like makeup parties。

 we're all tell girls hey I'm gonna take on this date but you have to be a favor and the girl's。

 like what I go you can't put any makeup on the date or it's not gonna happen I'm gonna kick you。

 out and she's like what and like almost like I get a lot of pushback on that I get a lot of girls。

 fighting me on that they're like no no I I probably haven't done this date I should be honest。

 for like six months but I because my date my thing now is like orgies and a lot of three sums but。

 but back then it was like like yeah when I was doing the the day two thing like heavily there's。

 like 15 chairs and his makeup stores in Mandalay Bay um and I literally just tipped a few。

 dollar bought the drink for the guy hit on his girl two months later three months later I own。

 part of his business um like it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's almost sounds unbelievable。

 like it sounds crazy I mean you come to Vegas I'll just I'll I mean it's it's in my product and。

 I'll introduce you to the guy in the store he's literally interviewing about how I met him。

 to show you guys you can meet your own business connections like that um if I actually cared。

 more about that business right more time I could kind of negotiate a little bit more out of that。

 right and some other deals but the point is this I really want you guys to understand you don't。

 have to spend a lot of money to get these nines or tens but you have to do something right that's。

 the that's kind of really really big key that a lot of guys fail to understand looks don't matter。

 money doesn't matter you don't have to gain you don't have to be manipulative you don't have to。

 have social proof but eventually you run out of stuff to do you have to have something right you。

 have to do something and my thing is massive status and friends that are that that will do anything。

 for me to the point where like even even people don't really like me that are in my life will。

 do a lot for me and girls see that and then they just wonder who I am and like what I'm like I。

 have a girl I have girls all day for a year to two years and they'll think I'm like Batman or。

 something they'll be like wait who like they'll come to me it's confusing because I'm just。

 honestly being like yeah this is me and they'll be like wait but no there's more later there's。

 something to it like what what's going on here just because there'll be a new guy that like randomly。

 bumps into us that's like holy fuck like that's just this complete admiration when we're just。

 walking through the mall massive social proof I mean social social proof is the number one thing。

 you should ever do a pickup period if there's one thing I mean if there's only one other thing I。

 could have other than social proof and be pre-selection right pre-selection is like social proof。

 but appointment basically right because these are things that are scientifically proven to pick up。

 girls the guys a lot smarter than me have come up with that this is like in very few things are。

 actually like scientifically proven to build attraction like it's kind of rare and instead of。

 much of like pick up jerk offs that like sat down and masturbated Hollywood and then came up with it right。

 I mean it paid off so much I mean financially it paid off because it's I mean it probably gets me。

 a few thousand dollars a year and I bought them a you know in Vegas drinks for like what 30 bucks I。

 bought my $30 drink I thought I threw on $30 drink and I aggressively hit on his girl。

 and I didn't see him though I just saw I for a long time I was into a we call him Sephardic girls。

 where it's like what is it like Israeli Jews is that what is like like Olive Skin yeah dark Jewish。

 but not the Ashkenazi like the dark Jewish like tall thin and like the fucking angry I like voice。

 and accent almost like Brazilian kind of like the one rip your fucking dick off like I was like。

 Vegas has a lot of these girls because they work in all the kiosks and all these stores right。

 so I would just start railing through these girls so the point where I had a name in the Israeli。

 community in Vegas for these guys and the surrender of this club at the encore used to be amazing。

 now it's kind of shitty but they all used to go here is this big Jewish Israeli Hebrew speaking。

 troop right he used to hear speak Hebrew oh there you go okay cool so they gave me a nickname。

 the nickname was an ignauf right so after after a long time it's not really a nickname but they。

 gave me a slogan I guess right after a while every time that sees guys they'd be like a Niga。

 noof a Niga noof right and it basically means I'm crazy I'm fucking crazy right it's kind of。

 what it means I don't know the literal translation that's my that's kind of what they told me。

 means right so I what I would do is every time I see these girls I didn't even I they were so。

 hot to me I didn't even see the guys I would just go straight up to these girls and I would hit。

 on them and I always I looked down and they would hold that whole hands with each other even if。

 they're like family or friends like it's it's a very like a touchy-feeling culture I guess right。

 and I see the hand I'm like oh shit my bad bro because I was like aggressively hitting on this。

 girl like this is why I was doing like super hard directing and then he he just kind of laughed he。

 was like he's just was amazed I was willing to like hit on this girl with him just staying there。

 and he turns out he owns more kiosk and Vegas than anybody else at the time than anybody else。

 in Vegas and he was about to then buy a bunch of stores well he you know I don't want to go too。

 much in the business especially unless you guys like are more curious about that but basically。

 long story short I just aggressively start hitting on the girl I'm like oh that's cute that's neat。

 that's that's really interesting but I just start hitting on the girl I'm like you know the。

 whole all the one-liners right if you're brown I'm down minority all this if you're like I'm。

 white and bright I'm just right I just kept going going going right to hit on this girl and he。

 just kind of like laughed I just kind of respected the fact that he like like when I'm out with。

 my girls right girls that I'm fucking and I see a guy like kind of look at them I go like this。

 without the girl knowing and I like try to hide behind something right because why do you think。

 what she's gonna do I just want to see what he's gonna do and like I have a rule like if you can。

 with the exception of like whatever my primary girl is at that at that moment for ever since I got。

 into pick up my whole rule was if you could take a girl that I'm picking like you see me in the。

 field and you could take a girl from me fucking do it just teach me how you did it later I got。

 I don't care like go go show me like if you can do it go for it like I love to see it that's great。

 I don't mean to even be arrogant like that's I learned a lot of valuable game lessons because I。

 lost a few of those in my first I had some painful lessons my first few years because I was always。

 my rule I just want to get better I don't really give a shit right so it helped a lot and then I'll。

 explain the the business route on that in a little bit here if you guys are curious about it but。

 the main thing for me is I realized he had the whole Dead Sea skin the the you know the。

 the Dead Seaman Dead Sea Dead Sea like take care of your hands or whatever so I was like all right well。

 do you guys do lashes too yeah it's how he said Dead Seaman is that what you laughing yeah yeah。

 yeah there you go well who knows right who knows what's in that shit but anyway the point was I was。

 like hey something a light bulb came on in my head which is I don't want to spend money on。

 makeup for girls but right I don't want to spend money but you guys like begging to spend money。

 on makeup for girls and it's fucking expensive it's more expensive than a clothes it's really。

 expensive especially if they're the good shit right yeah you have a girlfriend so you know so here。

 exactly so but like could I afford makeup for girls yeah I couldn't afford like pretty much。

 whatever makeup she wants any makeup she wants but I still don't want to do it especially when。

 I'm dating a lot of girls at one time however there's another batch of guys out there right it's。

 called seekerangebers。com that will that will buy any amount of makeup that this girl wants I mean。

 I'm joking with essay but there's another group of guys they'll just buy anything that these。

 girls want right and guess what if you were a girl would you not take it of course these。

 nines and tens right the reason that they're nines and tens and the reason why you don't actually。

 see them and why the hottest girl at high five five def whatever the fuck the club is right the hottest。

 girl in there is not a 10 because the 10 is in it on a jet somewhere or in Mexico right because。

 she's so hot that she's just getting thrown all these offers at her that that's where she is。

 and I'm not saying that to be negative that you can't get her but what I am saying is this。

 there's somebody that is gonna give her the makeup there's somebody who is gonna。

 get her the high-value area that she wants to be in right but guess what what's cool about that。

 no one's doing that for the four five sixes and sevens isn't her saying that so you beat。

 you I'll see you guys beat down the door I'll see you guys that are in better shape than me。

 taller than me wealthier than me running up and down the street doing game that I'm like what。

 are you doing I went dirty my shoes do this kind of like like what are you doing bro like you're。

 just our two high value already to be doing this and like especially then hitting on girls that。

 are like sevens like a best like what are you doing whereas instead you pull out the little。

 makeup trick like I just pulled right and every one of you have something like this that I。

 that I can't do because you all know people I don't know you guys all have connections that I。

 don't have that's one reason why my social blueprint product is gonna be the best thing that I've。

 ever done because I'm leveraging everyone else's social circle connections and we're gonna arbitrage。

 it between the group the makeup thing the light bulb went off the second he said that he's been。

 getting a makeup store because he didn't have it yet right but I saw something in him I was like oh。

 this I saw something in him I was like 22 of the time it's like long time I saw something in this。

 28 year old multi-millionaire very funny this degenerate pick-up artist saw something in him he was。

 gonna go far so anyway I saw something in this guy right now I was like he's gonna go really far。

 so let me bond with him and let me do all the tactics that I'm gonna teach you here in about 30。

 minutes the heart the brass text you know techniques of actually building this connection and getting。

 him to want to take members wing right see it's a huge strategy I have the you army and then。

 having them take you under their wing strategy which is cool too because it creates leverage even in。

 the process you don't have to do that much you just let them help you and they're excited to help you。

 and take you up it's pretty cool so anyway with him I was like what if I could just take every girl。

 on a day too to get her makeup done how epic like she'll give me all the credit I'll bond with the。

 girls who are doing like the lashes and and all the makeup takes like 45 minutes to do it properly。

 right what if I bond with the girl that's actually doing the makeup the whole time it's 45 minutes。

 I can go fuck off I can get some work done there's a Starbucks around the corner I can I could。

 go drink at minus five this crazy like ice bar thing right around the corner I can do whatever。

 I want to do I can go game pick up other girls well the Israeli chick is that I've already。

 ruthlessly flirted with is qualifying the girl asking her if she's good enough for me she's。

 literally like oh so how do you know Luke yeah yeah you you sure you good enough for him and。

 then she's like doing the makeup you sure which kind of lashes you want no no no you're too pale。

 for this she's like breaking her poor on the girl for me and I'm just the first time I saw。

 that I just started laughing my ass all this is fucking genius and the whole time like there's。

 there's there's our makeup stores called the core there's the core branded like champagne there's。

 there's a there's a fuck room in the back and the and like I was like okay I put a mattress back。

 here just like in like Rayleigh's girl it's like yeah sure fuck I need a new I need a new I'm like。

 I'm fucking crazy I got I'm the crazy guy cool and then there's literally just branded。

 balls of champagne and then he's like I barely own any of it and I'm not somebody like like。

 I'm only gonna name drop or like talk about stuff it's if it helps something otherwise I'm。

 not really gonna do it but he's like no no say you on the whole store say I work for you like he's。

 got this actually say I work for you I'm like all right you work for me I'm the boss but like he's。

 he's got like this like $40，000 bright-ling he's like decked out perfectly tailored clothes。

 and I'll come out coming like sweats I'm like yeah I'm the boss that just doesn't give a fuck。

 and then he's like yeah yeah he's the boss I work for for every girl that walks past it just。

 money right all from just a few little interactions it makes cold approach to be honest just look。

 silly it's like what am I like like I want to do cold approach right that's why I love hanging out。

 with Owen because Owen's just a cold approach beast and it forced me to do cold approach again right。

 because otherwise you know say like Vegas Miami LA New York Scottsdale I mean this is a perfect。

 city for this right any cold approach that you do for me is wasted time because I even if you。

 do fuck that girl you're now not gonna fuck the five friends that you could have that are hotter。

 than her anyway with less effort because she could have got them for you right the thing I want。

 you to keep holding on to the fact is that it's easier to fuck that nine with that fabricated。

 makeup store right that fabricated status I guess what says a couple of you guys probably have。

 the money that you could just do it if you do I can show you how to spend that money in a proper。

 way where it doesn't look like you're spending it but you're still getting the awesome shit right。

 I'm like one client a month it's like I don't care I'll buy the makeup store I'm like well I。

 don't know if you know how much this thing is I'm like no I'll just buy it I'm like all right。

 well we can't tell the girl this we have to go around we have to be around the bush with it。

 it is but you know what you know but you know what's interesting right for you it's not the hard。

 you who think it's hard to bond with a high value guy anybody intimidate by high value guys。

 usually it's like 25% of the room it's like intimidate by high value guys right from what。

 the little bit that you and I have talked right I mean I know that you're a fairly high value guy。

 like you know so it's not that difficult for you necessarily but what's difficult for a guy who。

 actually is above average and value right is to bond with that guy in a way that like isn't。

 intimidating right but in a way where they're excited to take you under their wing does that。

 make sense you give it value to each other it's also and even more than that right it's a race。

 to see who can put the you know it's a race you can give more value to the other person first。

 right here's the thing I don't want to say I don't want to look at them as different I see。

 where you're going with it and I like I 50% agree with you and I want to kind of add a couple。

 nuances to it to kind of specify because I like where you're going with it if you know my I look。

 at them is super different than me I look at everybody as different than me because I want to。

 I want to learn and I want to get to their level as quickly as possible so if I look at them as。

 if I if I tell myself that oh they're we're all kind of the same when you meet guys like that too。

 after you meet your first couple you'll realize that the higher status the guy the wealthier he is。

 the more famous he is the more bitches he is right the cooler and more humble and nicer he is。

 the higher net worth the guy or the hotter the girl like the nicest girl I've ever met with。

 PeriSoulton like you went really think that right the the next like 10 girls are on my hit list。

 right the girls that are makes it sounds so bad I can only say hit list after we honest so I。

 came out then now I can say otherwise it's not really bad they're all huge celebrities that I'm。

 going after well five of my huge celebrities five of them are like music video music music music。

 music video girls VMAs that that just was on the other day right the MTV VMAs yeah what's the。

 girl in that one uh was it to Tanya Tane fade is that her name I don't know。

 the in the gym the the hot dance move there you go Tiana Taylor there we go he would be the one。

 to know how to pronounce her name right so the thing is this when you when you tell yourself you're。

 going to go after these high value guys these high value girls these high status people you understand。

 that the higher status they are right the least intimidating they can be because they're going to。

 be nicer to you right it's like you you almost couldn't pay for their shit or introduce them to。

 more girls if you try because they'll tell you to stop right it's it's wild okay but they do put。

 people in frames in their own life that you have to jump out of understand because you can fall。

 into a frame if somebody's just kind of a worker be for them right if you're not careful it's。

 interesting because when you go out with girls you're already having sex with right when I go out。

 wouldn't be like meet like I'm you know I'll fuck a girl a few times we go out and like hang out。

 with her girlfriends I'm super quiet like unless we're gonna pound her girlfriends out which is。

 always by like like it's a it's a goal and a rule that I have I'm not like I'm gonna be really。

 really shy and kind of not awkward but like do people come to you all the time and they go they。

 ask me what's wrong what's wrong and I'm like I'm good what do you mean what's wrong I'm I'm。

 existing I don't know what do you want me what do you want me to do you want me to put a quarter。

 at me when we start dancing would you would me what do you like smile yeah I'm like I am smiling now。

 and I do like the Chandler smile I'm like what do you mean what do you what do you do and they're。

 like all the but you're and they always say that I feel like you're a different person when。

 you're with me versus them and I'm like yeah when I'm I'm trying to be productive what do you。

 don't want to you don't really want me to be me right now like that's it's kind of what I say I'm。

 like what is you like because you're saying like you're introverted I'm introverted but I have very。

 extreme extroverted skills that I can do that I can do specifically and then I'll stop introverted。

 means that you get your energy from being alone extroverted means you gain your energy from being。

 around other people that's really all that definition means it doesn't mean I mean I can be louder。

 than anybody I've been arrested three times because of game I mean I like I've done some epic。

 crazy shit because of game but totally no no completely but I want you what I guess I want you。

 to understand I guess is that you don't have to like become extroverted but you have to but you。

 can't be shy either right like the all this this horse should I've heard about like you can。

 be shy and still fuck hose is like the stupidest shit I've ever heard like if you have if you like。

 you can but then you have to have even more status than what I'm talking about like status beats。

 everything you use social proof and pre selection to get status okay then be see name me see my。

 snapshot before the orgy the day before the pool by chance why I was wearing the sailor hat。

 no I'm gonna provide all these snapshots to you guys to at some point if you want to save them all。

 you who saw the sailor hat cool so the sailor hat got me that orgy right I don't want to just like。

 the reason I bring up the snapshot all the stuff is because it sets stuff up that's a little sailor。

 hat got me to fuck two girls I mean granted I already fucked one girl right so it got me to。

 fuck three new girls I was probably gonna fuck the third one too but it got me to fuck the two。

 for sure 100% because I met them right after I left the DJ booth with the sailor hat because。

 it's another situation where like what kind of guy like nobody even who's even buying bottles at。

 that environment was a dayclub in Vegas right nobody was allowed in the DJ booth I go to the。

 DJ booth I asked them for a hat he gives me a hat and then I jump up and down and then I snap it。

 and that's everything that you guys saw on the snap right that's literally what happened and then。

 all of a sudden do you think being remembered what happened the second that I did this remember what。

 happened with the girl with the thong on what happened she came right to me and this is all。

 stuff that's why I kind of want this back and forth because if I'm just talking about it doesn't。

 seem as relatable doesn't seem like like it just to be honest doesn't seem like there's enough stuff。

 happening right it just doesn't seem like there's enough gears moving but what happened she came。

 up to me she started like licking my face right and then she like went like this with her titties。

 right and then I just looked at her I was like and I went over here right and then I grabbed。

 and then I uh that was the open no that's why that's why I try to get as many snaps like if。

 I'm going to snap it's going to be like I don't snap every day but when I snap it's like the。

 full set as much of it as possible the cool thing about that whole thing is Alex was filming in。

 field the whole thing the whole day you got on the camera right so I have the snap but I also。

 have the you know proper rsd style hitting camera of the whole thing as well so I'm my goal is。

 to picture and picture when I released it so that you can see like what I was doing at the time。

 well you can actually see the typical rsd style video to actually really get a good angle of like。

 what was I doing so you can duplicate it there's no game there's tons of game concepts that。

 work really well for me that I'm not going to teach you guys because they're not duplicatable I。

 they just work well for me because it's my personality I'm only going to teach you stuff that's。

 duplicatable that you can actually go do tonight or tomorrow right so with the hat thing right。

 me just going in that DJ booth then wearing that hat and then walking out of the DJ booth all of a。

 sudden those two these other two girls that I found way hotter just just came right up to me right。

 and then just started dancing with me now I also had pre-selection because I was with two girls。

 two girls that was getting to make out with each other in front of them right which is way。

 better have two girls sexually escalate around you than for you to actually escalate on the girl。

 like if you haven't watched any of my videos by now like that's my entire MO is I get the two。

 girls to make like two girls to make out with each other even I'm pulling just one girl I want。

 to be the guy whose hands off I want to be the guy like I literally will tell two girls after。

 get that making with making out with each other like a three I make out I say oh my god this is。

 perfect like this is awesome I oh my god like I just pretend like it's my first time I've done this and。

 this is amazing now granted like I usually play like vagor roulette like before I do these like。

 three some kind of things so vagor roulette roulette is very pop of vagor before you go to club。

 and you got about like you got like an hour and a half to like on purpose or an hour and a half。

 to like three hours before you're like fuck the no fat challenge do the vagor challenge and watch。

 how much how much how aggressive you'll be approaching I'm gonna keep going to that stuff。

 from opening clothes as well but let's get a couple questions do you guys like that by the way。

 I'm gonna I have a cup I'm gonna tailor the talk to audience do you guys like the fact that um。

 like when I talk about getting those closes with very little effort and then how I actually。

 got those things happen because those one of those girls was a solid nine one was an eight。

 there was like two eights and one nine um in that snapshot and then there's like two sixes。

 or whatever right do you guys like hearing about how like I'm able to do that without actually。

 pretty much effort in and showing you guys to do it especially when I go to these pools like。

 it's so hot I hate this fucking like the heat and then I didn't realize there's a place hotter。

 than Vegas it's called Scottsdale you have like the humidity and the Vegas it's crazy I。

 perfect whether my ass time was the year I'm dying out here um it's crazy it's I mean I suppose。

 you get used to whatever but I'm out there on this this pool thing right I don't look good like。

 it's like it's my least attractive environment I could possibly be in is me like a Vegas pool party。

 right now right I don't look like the male model days my Facebook past right um so I'm at this。

 pool party I'm wearing like like I was wearing like dress shoes I think too no boards shorts right。

 so what do I do now granted I built up a little social proof there you know over time but I've。

 been there three that was the third time I've ever been at pool it's like I go there all the time。

 any one of you guys could have gone to Vegas in the three day weekend and done what I'd so start。

 with the DJ booth I only got the two okay so the two girls right that was all so yeah I had the。

 two girls first I'm right I sat them at an empty cabana all right so also you get used to。

 high-value areas right get used to doing no minimum table areas so same as if you got a drink at。

 the bar right when I crack that code I the all of a sudden now I started fucking eights like。

 really really regularly and a bunch of like bottle rats right it's crazy how many girls will。

 fuck you because you're sitting at the table and they don't even know they're just ordering drinks。

 with the waitress what you wonder something it's even crazier like go to anybody been to Vegas or。

 Miami or New York like a like a crazy bottle area right with the super girls or New York Fashion Week。

 or whatever right or even here right there's a what's the bar blonde bottle blonde some。

 hotties that go there and this is a bit of a table area that's about as bottle a cake right。

 cake's a pretty bottle service area right you can just go to any table and ask the waitress to make。

 you a drink and then she'll let you stand there as long as you're not being a prick until the。

 drink comes and she can be your personal bartender that's kind of more epic than the table anyway。

 and you're you know who in here gets at least one drink when they go to a club right probably。

 at least half of you guys and if you know right you should be getting at least something right。

 go out go out less often get at least one drink and then do these techniques and you get。

 four times many girls right huh yeah yeah Arizona you guys gotta get some like good shit across。

 the border I'm sure right here's the if you're if you're doing beast mode and you're closing。

 nines and tens and girls that you're super like you're super excited about don't change the。

 damn thing if that's what you enjoy that's great because I like to do it once in a while once。

 while like literally once in a while I'm talking like once a week from my。

 someone's getting someone's getting a hammer back there um the the cold approach stuff right I do it。

 with my students especially my Vegas program like every night because it's I have to do it with。

 them right so it's I get that in during that time period right and then about once a week I'll。

 go out without without anybody just myself and then I'll go crush it cold approach as well。

 because it's fun it's like a super fun activity the I'm sorry it's very validating right as much。

 as we want to like beat the validation down all this stuff all I really need is a pretty girl。

 laughing my jokes like I go out I do do my little you know little routine stack not that you know。

 you have to have a routine but you do your little things that you know work you go to the whole。

 deal you you run the whole show run the circus it's fun it's very validating that being said you。

 know it's more validating is fucking four to eight girls a week that are my exact type of girl。

 and having it be this like weird situation where it's it's it's more perfect I ever thought it。

 would be what do you mean by that is like like the girls then want to stay they want to have like。

 Netflix and chill in for the next week to the point where sometimes I'll just stack the girls。

 and I'll keep doing it and like I remember last summer I'd like 12 to like 14 girls I have a。

 photo of it somewhere just back because each night we I would go out and we would just do the。

 same thing again but the girls would just stay in I would just keep collecting these girls right um。

 so like yeah that's a lot better than going out every night beast mode for sure what did I。

 technically do I said one line I looked at them I said get lit right um I I walk up and I go get lit。

 right um most of the guys that game with are black so there's a 50 chance I said。

 nigga get lit right because I like the guys I game with say that I have a pass so。

 because it's like literally there is just this whole like I'm either I'm either nigga Luke。

 or fam Luke like does like all the guys that I game with that's like my name right so I walk。

 up and I'm like get lit what does it mean get lit like get fucked up I like it's so broad at。

 this point that it just means like like you say that in a nightclub setting like a girl walks past。

 you try it tonight do that it's better open and anything you've probably been saying this week。

 girl walks past you look at her and go get lit fucking get lit and she's gonna look at she。

 would be like yeah get lit like she's good immediately she's like let's get fucked up right it's。

 it's crazy it's an it's amazing it works so well so then all of a sudden the bouncer was like。

 yeah get lit and I was just like all right get lit and we just like back and forth it was like the。

 the new age version of like the was it was up thing and the right and I said I really want one of。

 those and he goes what I go the hat you gotta give me one he goes okay he pulled the one from like。

 sitting right there and put the hat on me and I was like in my head I was thinking you'd have no。

 idea what you just started with this hat like that's awesome here's the if you're already。

 beast mode cold approaching you're better off than a lot of the people that I talk to about this。

 right you're just saying if you're already doing all this effort I'm telling you hey do one。

 third the effort right still do the beast mode cold approach just don't do it at the point。

 like exhausted do this other stuff instead that is more real world pickup right I'm gonna say。

 real world pickup I mean it's what real people are doing to get results no like that's that's a good。

 percentage of this is the spectra of grand I mean I haven't actually read that book but I've had。

 a lot of book I should read it I heard it's amazing um I think he came out with another new。

 version of it with 50 cent too right yeah is that good too yeah you like it yeah I actually only。

 knew about that one for a little while and like one of my biggest mentors was like don't tell me。

 you only know about the 50 cent one come on like he actually has everything yeah it's kind of funny um。

 yeah I mean my entire life is a spectral grandeur right like I mean like Aaron knows like I'm。

 either like quiet on my phone because I'm like doing business or I'm acting like a lunatic like。

 a nutcase right and but not in such a nutcase we're like like it's right to the borderline。

 of me looking super uncalibrated but it's just it just clearly shows that I there's nothing。

 that I'm saying I like haven't said before I'm not okay with so then it's fine so expect。

 of grander like well anytime I go into a nightclub I'm fully expecting to walk into that。

 DJ booth I'm fully expecting them to to sit at a promoter table and sit out of that table I'm。

 fully expecting to pull one of the top three like I'm just you have to be gregarious I think。

 you know gregarious means but like like a little more manipulative than that over the top but like。

 like really asking for what you want right audacity over the top but like you're it's definitely。

 has an implication you're getting something out of it right um someone who's gregarious when he's。

 gaming girls he's not gonna like he's not gonna stop asking girls to go home with him until he。

 fucks right you're gregarious you're going after what you want。
