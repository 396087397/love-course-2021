# 朱利安ten game：5.遗留内容：朱利安世界巡回赛亮点

 Who here has been in the game for under a year， Raise your hand。

 found out about this under a year ago， Alright， cool， in between one year and three years， Cool。

 over three years， two， how long， seven， eight years， eight years， nice， nine myself， no big deal。

 cool， cool， Were you guys at the last seminar I did here in Prague？， You were there？， Yes。

 you've been over three years too， Good， good， one， one， Yeah。

 actually I don't know if you guys were aware， but Prague was the city where I recorded my very first。

 video blog ever， I don't know if you've ever seen it， I'll show you just to show the difference。

 and then we'll kind of crack into some stuff， but basically， it's a quite show-de-view blog。

 this is Jyn on the Prague Prague， Boom， last of here， I just finished my free speech。

 and I thought I'd take this opportunity to， That was my first video blog， ever， ever， ever。

 and people see it and they're like， I was pretty good， I guess。

 but for me to actually record this one back in the day， it took me like three different tries。

 I was on this mini Euro Tour back in like 2011， and I tried recording this V-Blog in Copenhagen。

 I tried recording the same video blog in Berlin， and then finally I got it down in Prague。

 actually I even tried it in Stockholm when I couldn't。

 so I don't know for me it's kind of weird being back here， like I haven't come back since。

 this is like almost four years ago， and looking back。

 and I'll probably record a video blog about this later， in front of the same spot。

 it just makes you realize like， you know it gives you perspective on the progress， that you make。

 let's just say， okay and this is pretty key， and you probably heard me talk about it。

 how success is all these little 1%， you guys ever hear me say that？， okay it's like。

 you don't really notice your progress， until you take big chunks of time。

 and this is something that's extremely， discouraging if you don't know it， because guys will go out。

 and they determine their success， based on a night to night basis。

 you know it's like you out one night， you're doing well， you got the second night。

 say you do shitty， you're all in your head， you're all shy， you think you're not progressing。

 you feel like you're shittier than the previous night。

 because you're basing it on a night to night basis， or you take a week to week basis。

 and that's you， some weeks are good， some weeks are not that good， some weeks are tired。

 you know some other weeks are talkative， and that there， it'll fuck with your head。

 the key here is to take huge chunks of time， okay usually three to six months， okay back in the day。

 um， I remember when I first heard this， I was like oh my god， it made so much sense。

 basically where you're at now， your skill level on your best night， okay your best night right now。

 if you go out consistently， and you play it smart， depending on how much you go out。

 three to six months from now， that'll be your average night， that's the way it works。

 okay and in between those three to six months， you're gonna go up， and waste shittier than that。

 okay so you have to get into the habit of thinking， okay so he's low 1%， and it sneaks up on you。

 okay success sneaks up on you， so take a long period like， oh shit， okay like even me。

 realizing this， I'm like oh my god， you know like， if you would have met me back then。

 I was pretty damn good， but I was nowhere near， you know the way I'm now。

 I gave a seminar back then too， and you know a different voice， even I'm like， hello everyone。

 you know I sounded like Sam， I'm kidding I'm kidding， that was a low blow， you know it's pretty bad。

 I was just like， I trouble you know talking， my concepts were like。

 they were good but not very developed， I was extremely nervous， before going up in front of a crowd。

 like even back then it was maybe like 20 people， but I was like， like the scariest shit ever， now。

 I could do this in my sleep， you know， so it's pretty crazy， and I mean some of the things。

 to take out of this， is corny as it sounds， let's just say， it's take time to acknowledge。

 your fucking successes， okay or take time to acknowledge， the progress you make。

 okay this is something I noticed， with game， I would ask sometimes， on bootcamp。

 I'm like okay what was um， what were the good interactions， last night， and it's very tough。

 to remember for most guys， we remember all the negative， you rarely remember the good shit， you do。

 say you have a bad night， think back to right now， like one of your worst nights out。

 where you were just like， super scared， super in your head， you couldn't really， you're like。

 ah this sucks， this sucks， most likely， it wasn't all bad， there were a couple good things you did。

 but do you even know， what those good things are， do you even focus on them。

 no you just over blow the bad， it was all shit， no not necessarily， if you look back， at a week。

 you remember all the fucked up things， all the failures， but you rarely remember the successes。

 okay， why， because no one really， acknowledges them， and there's not as much， strong emotions。

 around success， you know， when you're a kid， your condition， to， if you do a good grade。

 it's like you did well， if you have a bad grade， what happens， you get yelled at， okay。

 there's way more attention， around it， even here， it's like you do a good set， you're like， oh okay。

 do the good set， whatever， you do a bad set， fuck you idiot， you should do better， okay。

 there's so much more around it， and in reality， too， it takes effort， to focus， and actually。

 acknowledge your successes， it takes actual effort， to be like， you know what， fuck， I did well。

 we're also scared， that if we acknowledge our successes， then we'll be fucking， lazy。

 we're like okay， why I made it， so we're just always hard on ourselves， and this is something。

 like it's， paradoxical， be got to do both， you know， as you're progressing， take time to look back。

 like okay， what did I do well， look back to where you started， I'm pretty sure， right now。

 no matter who you are， even if you didn't go out that much， even if you're lazy， or slacked off。

 you didn't make a lot more progress， than when you found out， about this one year， two years。

 three years， four years ago， acknowledge that， be appreciative about it， okay。

 and this takes effort， the same as， appreciating the fucking moment， okay。

 one thing I tell guys on bootcamp， and I'll tell you guys here too。

 who here was looking forward to this event， where is he going， looking forward。

 excited for this event， better be all of you， motherfuckers， who here is excited now。

 you're probably excited for a while， like oh my god， that's the event's coming， but。

 we rarely take time to actually acknowledge， that that moment is happening， like that moment。

 you were looking forward to， it's happening now， inside of you， you realize like oh， shit。

 it is happening now， I told guys this on bootcamp， I'm like hey， the bootcamp's happening now。

 enjoy it， because we always tend to jump to the next thing， the next thing， the next thing。

 I'm looking forward to it， and then it's happening now， and you're probably thinking。

 okay what am I going to do， after this event， what about tomorrow， fuck that， acknowledge it。

 acknowledge it's happening now， when you have a good interaction， acknowledge like。

 fuck that was a good interaction， instead of just jumping onto the next。

 or getting stuck on failure， okay， huge huge huge， and this will help。

 your self-esteem massively as well， okay， it's easier to like build on confidence。

 and put yourself out there， than thinking that， everything you do is just， fucking failure。

 you know， and also lowering the bar sometimes， okay it's like。

 depending on how high your bar of success is， you may have zero success。

 your life may be entirely just failure， okay， it's a mix of the two， now。

 thought I'd start off here， we're sharing you a little bit， of my story， okay。

 so if I ask you right now， and you look at me， do I seem introverted or extroverted。

 what do you say， okay do you think I was always like this， extroverted or is introverted。

 who says introverted， who says extroverted， okay out of the people who said introverted。

 did you all see then the fucking videos， mother of fuckers， no I was naturally introverted。

 okay it's pretty crazy the thing， it's like， for me again my natural personality， is extremely shy。

 extremely quiet， extremely reserved， I hate putting myself out there。

 hate having the spotlight on me， if I was at this event nine years ago， when I first started out。

 I would be in the back quiet， and most likely， if I heard the speaker say it would be interactive。

 and there would be exercises， I would leave， like no joke， I would like subtly be like。

 oh where's the bathroom， gone， it absolutely gone， so this was me back in the day， now。

 what I like about this picture， apart from like the dorky hair and all， is that the emotion。

 you get off of it， it's like you can just sense， I'm not just， I'm not very at ease。

 it's like very micromanaging， like in my outside or in my head， taking this picture， yeah。

 actually I've never done weed ever， no I'm I'm massively in my head。

 I'm like oh is this good enough， like analyzing all the little details。

 I'm not just outside my head just happy， like， hey， okay， very very different than now。

 when I started out， you know I always felt like， everyone was judging me， I was very paranoid。

 in micromanaging everything， even in terms of， what I wore for clothes。

 I was like oh what are people， going to think of this， what if I say this。

 even with my close group of friends， okay and I'm sure， a lot of you here can identify with that。

 okay do you fully feel comfortable， sometimes even with your close friends。

 putting your opinions out there， you know maybe sometimes， if it's safe， but。

 okay at least in my case back， then unless you do a lot of work on yourself。

 I doubt you're at the top of the， you know， scale of who's important in your group of friends。

 okay for me， I was never the main guy， with my friends， it was like there was one main guy。

 another guy another guy， and then there was me， and what they said， always carried more importance。

 even on small decisions， like what movie are we going to go watch， where are we going to go eat。

 okay， just think to your group of friends， whose opinion do people follow more。

 and for me was never me， and I never wanted to say， anything that would create any tension。

 so I was just constantly walking around， in the state of paranoia， walking on eggshells。

 I'm extremely stifled， like I just couldn't put myself out there。

 we tend to experience this with singing， if I asked one of you to sing in front of everyone here。

 you probably freak the fuck out， like， okay， and it's not that you can't sing。

 it's that something's holding you back， so I had that massively， and just massive scarcity。

 you know I had a huge fear of， ending up alone， you know just limited opportunities。

 and that should just burns you inside， okay like my first girlfriend， I was 15， it was three months。

 nothing happened， it was just three months of， she basically。

 wanted to go out with a friend of mine， who was cooler than me， he went out with another girl。

 so she settled for me， now I was extremely happy at this time， I was like。

 yes like this is the best I could get， and for three months it was me walking her to school。

 kiss on the mouth， back to the train station， and that was it， and after three months it ended。

 and then nothing for years， so I remember thinking even about 15， that when I got that girl。

 I was like this is the best you're ever gonna get， like that's the thought the pop might。

 this is the best I'm ever gonna get， never is life gonna present， a better opportunity。

 because she settled for me， so I hit the fucking jackpot here， now I can't fuck this up。

 okay so what does that mean I'm 15， I got a keeper here for three years， till we both turn 18。

 and I can marry her and keep her here forever， that's really what I thought。

 and obviously went to shit， so that's the mentality I was in。

 and that's feeling just burns you inside， day by day and the worst part was。

 is until finding out about the game， I just took it for granted。

 and just thought that that was the default， I just thought like that's the baseline。

 of what you should be feeling on a day to day level， okay and it's pretty crazy。

 we tend to think oh this is the normal feeling， but objectively we constantly feel like shit。

 it's pretty crazy， we're constantly stressed， there's constantly that little voice inside your mind。

 there's constantly like little， again knots of anxiety， and for you that's your default。

 okay and I can ask you right now， do you feel pretty normal， do you feel happy or do you feel good。

 cool right， okay well let's do a little wacky exercise， and again buy into this。

 okay participate even if you think it's kind of wacky， you're here so what the fuck。

 so sit straight in your chair， okay sit straight， and close your eyes。

 okay we're gonna do this like 30 seconds， close your eyes and open your mouth。

 now I'm okay close your eyes， close your eyes close your eyes， um， and it's like one guy surprised。

 hey， um， okay close your eyes go inside your body， and just notice how you feel。

 okay you all said he felt okay， but just go inside notice the different emotions。

 notice the different thoughts， the pop in your head， okay the little voice in your head。

 close your eyes， okay， um， now okay notice is it happy thoughts， negative thoughts。

 are you feeling relaxed or is there any anxiety， okay look at your body language， your posture。

 is there any tenseness in the way you're sitting or not， is there tenseness in your shoulders。

 in your neck， yes or no， okay， is there a little worry， is there a knot in your stomach。

 again it's like a little bit of tension， maybe there's something in your life right now。

 you wish you could control， you just have no control over， and it's stressing you out。

 okay and you just wish you could control it， but again you just can't figure out the。

 what's gonna happen， again maybe there's something you're trying to figure out。

 you just wish you could figure out the answer， you wish you could know the solution to this。

 but it's again still in the unknown， and that unknown is freaking you out， maybe there's some task。

 you know you should have done， you've put off， and you keep putting off。

 and the more you put it off， the more anxiety it provokes， maybe you should be doing that task now。

 instead of being at this seminar， and being at this seminar， those couple three hours。

 again starting to stress you out even more， maybe you know you don't have the will power to actually do it。

 maybe that's stressing out too， okay， so just kind of notice， the emotions and the thoughts。

 and try to notice them objectively， imagine someone else。

 other than you was transported in your body， feeling what you're feeling。

 thinking what you're thinking， how enjoyable of an experience with that person have。

 would he be like oh man， these are awesome emotions and thoughts。

 or is he thinking shit it must suck to be this person， okay objectively someone else。

 and say that person had to rate his experience， on a scale of one to ten。

 ten being amazing relax that he's happy， one being super stressed paranoid。

 just again not happy with the present moments， just not not even super negative。

 but a little bit of just like yeah， okay what would he rate it， and you can all open your eyes。

 I doubt you were all a ten， okay， I doubt you were and I'm pretty sure。

 suddenly there's like oh shit， there was some worry or some emotions， again you just。

 noticed like emotions you took for granted， they're not necessarily horrible。

 but they're just like a little bit， okay it's like that， refrigerator hum in the back of your mind。

 and me before the game， I was probably a three out of ten， every single day， three out of ten。

 now being realistic here， okay you'll never reach ten out of ten forever。

 okay you'll have little flashes of ten out of ten， this is more of an ideal that you move towards。

 but we're a lot lower than we tend to think， okay and me finding out about this。

 okay just reading the game nine years ago， randomly， gave me that control。

 well my god I can fucking change this， you don't have to take it for granted。

 you can change how you feel， and you can again expand on that。

 and for me here I feel so much more at ease， than I ever did back then。

 okay back then even in school， giving a speech in front of the class。

 or like reading a book in front of the class， was a scariest day of school。

 it was crazy I just couldn't do it， now I feel fully at ease， and in a way。

 if you want to get a little deeper， okay and we'll talk about this too。

 the reason you're probably even doing this， like to get girls， I mean obviously say， sex。

 confidence， so on and so forth， but， I doubt you were born just wanting to fuck a hundred girls。

 like I just need to fuck a hundred girls， why do you need to fuck the hundred girls。

 so that you can actually feel at ease， so you can feel okay with yourself。

 because if you fuck a hundred girls， and all your friends think you're cool。

 because they know you fucked a lot of girls， suddenly you don't have to worry about。

 micromanaging impressions， you're cool you're accepted， or if you fuck a hundred girls。

 that means they all like to me， I can finally like myself， you're just chasing that。

 feeling okay it's insane， it's insane， and I mean this is something。

 depending on how you go about this， okay you'll either chase the hundred girls。

 and you'll just keep on chasing， and I'll have students like that。

 like more and more and I'm like why， because he doesn't even know why， that's pretty crazy。

 it's like why are you doing this， do you know why， do you know why you want all the girls。

 do you know why you're in the game， in the first place， what do you think it's just。

 because you're supposed to be here， most guys don't even know why。

 it's like well it's because it's the game， yeah but why， because you know I'm competitive。

 why do you need the 10， because because it's like no， why， okay for me one of the big ones。

 was just， that feeling of being at ease， okay and， again the girls will give you that。

 but the process you undergo to get， the girls that will give you that。

 okay so that was me starting out， and it was extremely difficult at first。

 okay I couldn't you probably heard me talk， about this in videos， I couldn't even open an old lady。

 and ask for the time back in the day， I'd be walking around the you know。

 in Switzerland too scared to go to a bar， club and， too scared to talk to anyone。

 for like three months， okay， now although I sucked， although it was scary。

 one of my biggest strengths， and I still associate my biggest， strength to this day。

 being this here， okay more than， the crazy things you might have seen， on YouTube or etc。

 in the infield， my biggest strength， is that I could take perspective， and be my own worst enemy。

 okay I could kick myself in the ass， and I could go against myself。

 and this is something we don't really do， okay so for example， when I started out。

 I'd be walking around like crazy for three， months and I'd be coming up， every fucking excuse。

 not to talk to girls， you know it's like oh to not， hurt to scary what about this， what about this。

 and after three months I realized， I didn't have enough willpower to do this。

 and you might identify with that， you may go out and some of you just know。

 you just don't have the willpower， your excuses take over。

 maybe you can't even get out of the house， some nights because you don't have the willpower。

 now that's fine， as long as you realize it， stop living in denial， now that you know this。

 how are you going to counteract it， now that you know all the different excuses， you come up with。

 you could even write them down， how are you going to counteract those excuses。

 okay you're in the present moment， you know the future you is going to come up with those excuses。

 what can you do to prevent that， what can you do now to go against that。

 and that's what I started doing， okay so the first thing I did。

 is I put myself in a situation where I didn't have a choice， and that really depends on you。

 for me it was going out with， a few guys in Switzerland when I started out。

 I joined this online forum called the Swiss Pimp Community。

 it doesn't exist anymore but it was like a fondue， casserole for like the banner。

 eight to twelve guys weird as shit， but they were going out， and I went out with three guys。

 in my first time out， opening， and everyone was opening。

 and because I didn't want to be the only guy not opening。

 that was the extra push I needed to do my first approach， it's kind of petty but for me that worked。

 okay for you what's the push you need， okay a universal one， the works on every fucking guy。

 whatever it is right now， you're you have trouble going out， you have approach anxiety。

 even in life in general， you're lazy you're procrastinating， you want to know the one trick。

 to get over that， this is this is the only magic pill there is， do you want to know it， alright。

 give a thousand dollars to your friend， tell me keep it if you don't do it， done trust me。

 no matter what it is， if you have approach anxiety， if you're scared to go out， you lack motivation。

 give a thousand if a thousand is nothing， give him like ten thousand。

 whatever's a lot of money for you， and trust me you're going to do it。

 now the hard part here is you actually won't give him the money。

 because you know you'll do it if you give him the money， so that's the thing I had。

 is like I knew that， and I could just fuck with myself。

 I'd give sometimes like my wing a hundred bucks， my give me ten bucks back every fucking open。

 and I'd hate it because I'm like， why did I do this， but now you're stuck in that situation。

 you got to be able to push yourself， in those situations。

 where it's like why the fuck did I just do this to myself， realize the opportunity cost。

 if you look right now， at how many hours you spent， doing game thinking about game。

 reading about game， watching game， all those hours， that's a lot of time。

 imagine you invested that much time， and say making more money， or in building a business。

 or getting a promotion， you'd be way better off than you are now。

 now funny enough game will affect that as well， but if you're investing that much time， go all out。

 because you're， it's like if you go out four hours one night， that's four hours of your life。

 you could be doing something else， make it worth it， it's like be very entrepreneurial。

 get a return on that investment， because you are investing something。

 you're losing money at the second， every time you're out， so for me just kind of realizing that。

 took it seriously， and the other big one， and this is something I learned。

 when I started traveling with Owen， this year was like， I did my first three years in Switzerland。

 and I started just going really all out， and because the fact that I was taking a lot of action。

 and I could push myself， that would attract a lot of wings。

 okay and I'd get better and better wings， after three years I moved to Los Angeles。

 okay this is like five six years ago， like six years ago， and that's when I met Owen。

 and for two years I started traveling around America， with him， doing these seminars。

 these boot camps， these video seminars， every single weekend around America。

 okay and that's when I really started， just living the game， now this was a huge turning point。

 and this is a misconception， in the community where we tend to think， you know instructors。

 or guys who get paid to do this， naturally get better because they have more time， would you agree。

 if you were paid to do pickup 24-7， you'd probably be better， but that's not the main factor。

 the main factor is， that by being paid to do pickup， you see way more other guys doing pickup。

 that's the main value， okay so realize this， and I'll talk about this a bit。

 this is one of the biggest realizations I had， when I was traveling those years。

 is that there are two games that are being played， and we're just too focused on the superficial。

 the same isn't an interaction， you're too focused on the words， one game that's being played。

 where you go up to， and then you start seeing the patterns。

 that's probably where you're focusing on now， you know how to open， you know how to hook。

 you know how to read， social cues， so on and so forth， you start seeing all the different patterns。

 and you get that skill set down， how to game a girl， now what's the other game that's being played。

 and the one that was reinforced here， you go to thousands of guys， not women， guys。

 and you also see the patterns， and that there is so much more valuable， why？ because I could see。

 all the different patterns， in terms of how they're going about getting good at game。

 I could see the different sticking points， the different excuses， the different paths。

 different mistakes， the guys who made it， the guys who didn't make it。

 the way they'd interpret all the material， etc etc the different backgrounds。

 how they'd applied to the material， and now you know how to learn that superficial game。

 and those are the two games， gaming a girl， learning how to game a girl。

 okay and some questions to get you thinking about this， is ask yourself two guys。

 one guy's introverted， the other guy's extroverted， they're learning game。

 are their journeys going to be similar？， so what's the difference？， what you have two guys？。

 what you tell them？， you're the introverted guy， how do you go about this？， you're the extra。

 how do you go about this？， they're going to have different sticking points。

 they're going to have different plateaus， they're going to have different excuses。

 different interpretations of what happens， there's another one， two guys go out。

 they get the same reference， they get a number， a five minute number， they get the same reference。

 they're going to have different excuses， and where they come from， one guy could move up。

 the other guy could move down， so how do you know if you're moving up or down？。

 how do you know which excuses you have？， how do you know which beliefs to reinforce？。

 it's pretty fucking crazy， okay when you go out， should you go out by yourself or with a wing？。

 if the answer is with a wing， how much should you still go sometimes by yourself？， what's the ratio？

， if you go out with a wing， should you go out with many wings。

 and get all these different perspectives， when you go out。

 should you focus on one concept or on a lot of concepts？， how do you balance that out？。

 should you hit it intensely？， what does it mean hitting it intensely？。

 does it mean doing a lot of approaches or maybe some longer sense？。

 should you break down every reference？， how do you break it down？。

 how do you know how to find your sticking point？， okay， here's another one。

 what's your sticking point？， do you even have a sticking point？。

 if you don't know what your big sticking point is， that's your sticking point， it's pretty crazy。

 if you don't have something right now， that you're working on precisely。

 like this is my big sticking point， this is what I'm focusing on。

 if you don't have something that you're focusing on precisely， you're fucking up。

 now here's another trap， you think you have a sticking point， but in reality。

 it's another sticking point， that's called a comfort trap。

 different ways that we can remain in our comfort zone。

 sticking point is not any question that comes to mind。

 sticking point is like if you could get rid of one thing。

 the big one that would give you the most return， what would it be？。

 it's not opening on the dance floor， that's not a fucking big sticking point。

 if there's one thing you could fix right now in your game， that would give you all the results。

 but it'd be opening on the dance floor， I doubt it， opening helps on the dance floor。

 you should know how to do it， but that's not the big one， what's the big one？。

 how long have you had your big one？， and I can guarantee it's at least over three months。

 even if you're good， it takes that long to get rid of it， and most likely， a lot of you here。

 it's over a year or two years， whether you acknowledge it or not， you've always had that big one。

 maybe you have trouble being man to woman， why？ maybe you just can't let that out。

 you probably had that for a long time， maybe you have entitlement issues。

 you probably had that for a long time， now here's the interesting one， we like our sticking points。

 why？ because they help with the rationalizations， now that you know about game。

 and here's what's interesting， you know about game， you're fucked， I say it in some videos。

 you've seen behind the curtain， no matter what you do。

 you're going to go through a lot of discomfort， you either ignore it and try to remain the same。

 and what will happen there， and you may have some friends who give up。

 and you'll see this progress will only happen， you know you're living a life of fucking up。

 because you know you could be better， and for the rest of your life。

 you're going to be living a life of fucking up， that will kill yourself a steam。

 it'll burn you inside， you'll live a horrible miserable life。

 you can try to convince yourself that old game was not for me。

 but in your gut till the day you die you will know， so you can't go back。

 but moving forward is extremely difficult too， because you're going outside of your comfort zone。

 so you're literally， you're fucked， you're at the crossroad where both roads lead to pain and discomfort。

 you know I wish you could go back in time， to before you typed in how to get girls， you can't， okay？

， so what tends to happen is guys try to ignore it， like I'm not going to do it。

 and after a while they're like okay fuck it， I'm going to do it。

 and then they get their first sticking point， and then they hang on to it， why？

 because you can tell yourself hey， I'm not slacking off， I'm going out。

 I'm taking action but I'm remaining the same， huge comfort track。

 this is also why a lot of guys don't sit down to break down their references， most guys just go out。

 go out， go out， go out， go out， this is why you don't have a specific sticking point you're focusing on。

 you just kind of go out， but just by going out it's not enough， why？

 because we are so addicted to comfort， and you can kind of look at this。

 most likely your nights out look the same， same type of action， same type of results。

 same type of excuses， same type of mental dialogue， pretty much the same。

 you want to get a little wackier？， your days are probably the same。

 90% of your thoughts here today were your thoughts yesterday， it's crazy。

 we ask ourselves the same questions， like oh it's my life and all this。

 and all the same images and everything every single day， if you go out， go out， go out， go out。

 you're just wasting a lot of time， spinning your fucking wheels， okay？

 so you have to actually sit down， and look at what you did， okay this is what happened。

 what can I change？， take some perspective， and that's tough because then it faces the fact that there are parts of your。

 fucking up and now that you know it， now you have to change， that's why people don't do it， okay？

 but be careful of falling into that trap， breaking down your references is 51%， going out is 49%。

 breaking them down or it's even more important， I break down my references to this day。

 what do you think my content comes from？， what do you think I do for work？。

 what do you think I do in boot camp？， I break down references， that's all I do。

 break down references， you gotta know how to do it， okay？ so that's a huge comfort trap。

 another one you can kind of see in this is what Sam said before， is you have a sticking point， okay？

 think of whatever your sticking point is， what did you really do to fix it？。

 one guy in albacurkey is sticking points flaking， like what did you do？ I've gone out more。

 what else？ I've put more of my personality， and my interactions， what else？ that's it。

 how long have you had this sticking point over a year？。

 I'm like dude if that was me I'd watch every fucking video。

 write it all down and feel it's everything until I figured it out， but we don't do that， okay？ why？。

 you want to know the real truth？， most of us are insane， to find insanity， what is it？。

 the same thing over and over again， yeah doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results。

 that's most of us， okay？ you want to kind of realize how it hits on you here？。

 most of you here are going to come to this seminar。

 you're going to leave this seminar feeling pretty good， I hope， except for you， smile， it's like。

 it'll help in field， trust me your default is horrible， you gotta force yourself to smile。

 it'll make you a little happier， and then you go out and you'll be like yeah I was inspired。

 and it may last a week， may last two weeks， and then the effect will wear off。

 and you'll go back to where you're at before this seminar， a lot of guys。

 seminars it's like new year's eve， it's pretty crazy。

 if you don't know for example by the end of this seminar， what it is precisely。

 you're going to be working on， what you're going to change。

 precisely in the way you go about things， you're fucked， and you won't get good， very very slowly。

 it's pretty crazy， you can ask yourself， what am I going to do differently。

 and maybe you're thinking right now， you know what？， I'm going to go out more， but that's too vague。

 vagueness kills everything too， go out more how much more， what days？， from what time to what time？。

 how are you going to make sure you stick to that goal？， if you don't know this now。

 what makes you think you're going to know it later？， and this is huge。

 don't come to this seminar to be like this is a cool experience， come to this seminar thinking。

 okay this is supposed to give me thinking， this is supposed to be a fucking smack in the face。

 to realize， up until now， if you don't make any drastic changes moving forward。

 what makes you think it's going to be different？， what makes you think me inspiring you a bit。

 it's going to change everything， it's not， and this is what I realize here， this is what。

 traveling around for like two years in America， seeing all these different guys。

 all these different backgrounds， seeing a point， made me fucking realize， okay。

 I then traveled around the world by myself， this is my fourth world tour。

 came into this like four years， everywhere， and pretty much reached a point now。

 where as I joke my life is the game， it's like I am the game， you know I reached a point where。

 almost every single day at this point， I'm giving seminars on game， everyone I meet。

 I talk about the game， everyone I know is in the game， every book I read is about game。

 every movie I watch I'm thinking about game， every video is about game， I make videos about game。

 I think about game， I'm thinking about game， I am the game， this is all I do。

 I'm like a one-dimensional game， not something you should all aim for， okay at all。

 but that's how far I push this， okay I win all out， and for me， like this turning point。

 was one of the biggest ones ever， okay， I also launched two products。

 one is PIMP and you want to hear， see that？， love it， hate it， good， it should be love it。

 no for me PIMP， this one here was， this is the product， what I've given myself。

 starting out back in the day， instead of foundations， that's the way I viewed it， it's like。

 you know， all the different elements， to gaming a girl， so this is the， the superficial game。

 it's like if you open， you do this， then you do this， if you think this you do this。

 if this happens you do this， this is this， and it's like this whole， cause and effect， okay。

 and it goes through， female psychology， inner game， outer game， and I had it， infield flashes。

 for all the concepts， I'm a， I'm an outer player， I give speeches from thousands of people。

 what are you going to do？， I'm an outer player， I'm looking at you， just in your head， talking。

 trying to qualify yourself， trying to prove yourself， say CNN again， I have been out to CNN。

 proving myself， and now you think shit， I don't know what to say next， I look away， I try to talk。

 try to break the tension， I look into his eyes， and I can feel， the strong， tingling in my emotions。

 I get a bit more in my head， he gets closer， gets more head touches my。

 I don't know what's happening， I don't know if I should push him off， or stare， if I stop staring。

 I lose the brain， I get in my head again， I stare harder， trying to provoke some anger。

 but it's not working， he's still penetrating through， grabs my shoulder， less my back。

 hugs me and again， I push him off， thinking it'll help， but it just won't help， he grabs my hair。

 I'm like， damn this guy， could be Alexander's last guy， I feel bad， oh， okay， so again that's like。

 Pimp， it's pretty out there， thank you， and， thank you， if you want a funny story too。

 when I launched this product， and this really made me， like a slap in the face。

 about the game beneath the game， I launched it， and I remember telling my friend。

 who was helping me with the marketing， my dude， this product is going to， end the pickup community。

 why？， because it's all there， how do I pick up girls？， Pimp， there's nothing more to say。

 there's nothing more to talk about， it's all there， what's 2 plus 2？， 4， it's done， ties it on。

 it's over， that's really what I thought， super obnoxious， I thought that。

 and I launched the product， and it is amazingly well， because actually one of the best launches。

 in the history of the company， no big deal， and I launched it， and here's the interesting part。

 okay， so I was so sure it was all there， and I even said in the product， if you've seen it。

 if by the end of this product， you don't know what game is， give up， it's not for you， okay。

 there can't be winners， without losers， you're not meant to have kids。

 you're not meant to reproduce， invest this money， in video games， and die alone， okay。

 so that's what I thought， and I launched it， and I started my third world tour， after that。

 this is like， almost two years ago， and you know， people would come up to me， at every event。

 like oh my god， I've changed my life， I love it， but there were still a few， who got Pimp。

 and who still sucked， and it kind of shocked me， because I was like， I really thought。

 you'd have to be a retard， not to get it， I mean seriously， think about it， if I gave you right now。

 all the little systems in play， you say this， you do this， this， this， this， this。

 this is a reaction， this is all the infield examples， what you should do。

 you think you could figure it out， you think that would help you， and figure it out， yeah， bullshit。

 okay， I could literally give you all， right now， Pimp， like for free， here's Pimp。

 80% you would still suck， probably 90% you would still suck， okay， on one hand， what would happen。

 because it's free， you probably wouldn't even watch it， it's so funny， it's so crazy。

 you would probably get it， and they're like， oh watch it here and there， versus if you paid for it。

 then you would watch it in detail， so that's the first fuck up， and the other one。

 is you wouldn't even know where to start， you would have no idea， and that's what I realized。

 I would do the tour， and you know， I say there's if there's one thing， everyone hasn't commented。

 around the world， I don't care who you are， is that no guy has any idea， what the fuck he's doing。

 when it comes to learning game， you know， you guys ever see， on Facebook， there's sometimes。

 those funny workout videos， like doing it wrong， is there see， like he's on the ball。

 with a bench press， like you're like， oh my god， and the guy thinks he's。

 super cool but he's doing it wrong， that's what I see， when I go to a club， I look around。

 it's everyone doing it wrong， like that's what I see， and it's not， the lack of content。

 or knowledge， it's not like， the guy at the gym， he doesn't have the weights。

 he just doesn't know what to do with them， here too， it's like。

 you probably have more than enough content， in your mind right now。

 you probably have so many openers， so much theory， you just don't know， what to do with it。

 you don't understand， how to make a click， and that's why guys， are just， spinning their wheels。

 like crazy， so kind of reinforced， what I learn， traveling with Tyler， and that's when I launched。

 shift， anyone here see shift， love it， hate it， who the fuck， you say， hate it， god damn it， okay。

 so shift， and I'll just quickly， go over this， because I think this， really helps a lot of guys。

 this is the way I broke it down， so for me with this one， this is me treating。

 you like a fucking retard， no offense， it's me taking your hand， like a retard， and saying like。

 do this， and it all starts， with what the fuck， is game and attraction。

 and here's an interesting one， you want to get， get a little bit mind， fucked through this。

 pop quiz， let's just say right now， someone walks in， doesn't know what game is， at all。

 and you have to define， everything that is， gaming that we're doing here， in one sentence。

 what's game， what's game， what's game， what's game， what's game， all failed， it's crazy。

 we all know what game is， game is all of this， but if you have to boil it down， precise。

 you don't even know， you don't even know， what you're doing precisely。

 how the fuck do you want to succeed， it's insane， that's the first thing I realized。

 now test guys on bootcamp， I'm like god damn， and if you want my， one sentence definition。

 game is an endless journey， of finding ways to make yourself more attractive as a man。

 and getting women as a byproduct of that， that's what it is， that's what we're all doing here。

 it's an endless journey， why， because you can always be better， there's never a point。

 where you're good enough， right， I hope， you can always be better， and better。

 even if you're married， with kids， doesn't mean you have to go， fuck girls。

 you can still keep improving as a person， so it's an endless journey， of finding ways。

 to make yourself more attractive as a man， and what does that mean， is that。

 it doesn't mean superficial， necessarily it means more so， develop your personality。

 feel more at ease， confidence， grounded， so on and so forth， so it's endless， you improving that。

 and by doing that， following that path in purpose， women will come to you。

 you get women as a byproduct， you're not aiming to get the women， you're aiming to do this。

 and because you do this， women fuck you， that's what you're doing， on a more micro level。

 this is what you should be doing， when you're out at night， you're not gaming the girls。

 you're gaming yourself， and by doing that women， fuck you， pretty wacky， okay， there's a saying。

 I think it's Jim Rohn， don't pursue a tract， I never focus on getting the girl。

 I focus on getting the shit， that will attract the girl， say， building an abundance of fun。

 that's like the first one， fun， positivity， you know， just happiness。

 the next one is care-free-ness， not giving a fuck， feeling at ease， the third one is passion。

 engagement excitement， by me doing that， which is in my control， which is why I've consistent。

 nights out， because it's never depending on， anything external， me gaming myself。

 I make myself feel awesome， that transfers on the girls， they feel awesome。

 and they fuck me to thank me， that's game， okay， so you always have to ask yourself。

 whatever you want， what can you do， to get that， is a byproduct， of doing this， huge。

 you don't aim for it， or you attach the outcome， and it's too much forcing。

 it's like how can you create a situation， where you're doing something， that's in your control。

 which allows you to get the outcome， you want， is a byproduct of doing that， building on this too。

 we all have victim mentality， to a certain degree， we feel it's， we feel sorry for ourselves。

 we feel we're different， anyone here， feel like they got it， a little harder than anyone else， okay。

 it's pretty crazy， but as you'll see later， when I kind of start， hitting on some sticking points。

 we all have the same fucking sticking points， okay， and it's human tendency too。

 we tend to always over blow other people， okay， I still have sticking points too。

 I still lack willpower， I still slack off， I'm still lazy， I still run out of things to say。

 I still get rejected， all the fucking time， okay， so there's different ways， to snap out of it。

 and it's like， PIMP do this， then you think this， then you reinterpret it this way。

 so on and so forth， superiority， where we think we're above it， okay。

 and what you're actually doing， transcending your identity， building on your current identity。

 not getting attached to it， the different comfort traps， taking right action。

 this is game by the way， from there you got to get your head， just through it on straight。

 so motivation， on a macro level， on a micro level， one thing that I'd recommend you all do。

 and this is what I did， and this is probably why， you're dabbling right now。

 is you didn't get clear， on why you're doing this， you didn't get your leverage and check。

 three questions， I asked myself starting out， this is a pact I made， number one。

 what'll happen exactly， if I do this， it's like why are you doing this。

 in which way will doing this， benefit your life， exactly and precisely， why are you doing this。

 okay， and how will that affect your life， here the first question by the way， this is where。

 it's like the carrot， it's like the pot of gold， that you're running towards。

 and here you got to paint the fucking dream， okay， it's like if you do game， what'll happen。

 what's the best thing that'll happen， how will this positively affect your life precisely。

 so you wouldn't be， you wouldn't have any anxiety， what else， it's shorter than my。

 and what would that make you feel like， relax， relax， and how would that affect your life。

 again keep doing cause and effect， okay， you， I can't apply what I've learned。

 to pick up two others， just go to my laptop， basically it's for like， something like that， perfect。

 yeah， so even that I would be even more precise， I'd be like， okay this here。

 you don't make me feel good at ease， okay to get my social skills， that would have。

 helped my friendships， which would make me do this， and this， it would help my business。

 it's like you should have this huge list， of what you're running towards。

 and this is key too by the way， and I tell this to guys on bootcamp。

 or even if you've seen any of my products， if you've taken a bootcamp， if you've seen pimple shift。

 and you did not find a way， to make your money back， with the content you learned， you fucked up。

 you fucked up big time， it's insane， like if you knowing about game， your business， or pay。

 or lifestyle did not increase， you're fucking up， okay it's insane， it's insane。

 for me it's like this here， changed every aspect of my life， you get the hustle down。

 you realize again， oh this is what's blocking me here， this is blocking me here。

 like it's so much more than just women， don't just apply this on women， apply this everywhere。

 you should all be making way more， than not knowing about the game， and if not。

 it's again you got to start thinking about that now， it's insane if you aren't， okay。

 so here you paint the dream， the next question， is what will happen exactly， if I don't do this。

 what will happen if I do this， what will happen if I don't do this。

 and this here is where you paint the fucking nightmare， this is where you scare yourself shitless。

 what will happen， what's the worst thing that will happen， if you don't do this， you。

 for me it's the feeling that I've reached my goals， okay， now that doesn't sound very scary。

 what's so bad about that， keep building， how will that make you feel。

 how will that affect your life， this is where you should be scared， if it's like。

 well if I don't do this， I guess I won't reach my goals， whatever， it's not enough， scary。

 scare yourself， at the same time， I wouldn't， improve my social skills， why is that then。

 I wouldn't affect my way of interact with people， make a friend， so what would happen。

 keep following the cause， how would they make you feel， how would that affect your life。

 well if I look back at my life， and just make me feel， it's not enough， it's scarier。

 what about you， you saw it with just， I don't know， it's a little closer than heroin， you know。

 it's not like you guys， it's got plenty of stuff， I don't know， I don't know， yeah， the last day。

 where you would be， lying on the bed， lying， you would think， all these memories， you would regret。

 if you didn't， and you， I like that one but that one's still， not that bad。

 because it's just one day of shit， it's just one day where you're like， oh， also， but you know。

 also I don't want you to stay， with that team as you might， I'm scared， okay， so some big ones。

 the first one which we kind of， talked about before， is that you don't have a choice。

 because if you don't do this， you know you're going to be， fucking up， and that's going to affect。

 your self-esteem， that's going to affect your， self-concept， and because of that。

 you're going to go down， okay not doing this， it's not like you remain the same now。

 it's just like every day， that you know you could be， better and you're not， you're going down。

 and you're going to self-， so you're going to start， self-sabotaging， relationships， opportunities。

 jobs， friendships， and you're going to start， going down， down， down， down。

 because you're not growing， as well， the only way for you to feel， happiest through external。

 stimulus， you're going to start drowning， yourself in television，， internet， movies，， drugs， drinks。

 etc etc， and it's just going to keep， going down， and most likely， you'll die alone， okay。

 either natural causes， or you might check out early， even， no one will know。

 and no one will fucking care， and that'll be your life， that's your existence， gone to waste。

 now a little exaggerated， at the same time， not， okay， very likely that'll happen， a lot of people。

 live fucking， miserable lives， and that's some extra， leverage too， it's like you look around。

 and we always tend to， place everyone else on， pedestals， but if you actually look。

 around realistically， a lot of people， are like that three out， of ten， like me before， the game。

 every fucking， day living a shitty， life till the day they die， it's very possible， it's horrible。

 okay， on top of that two， I mean just some other ones， you know not having a girl。

 and not having someone， with whom you can actually， share who you are with， sucks。

 okay it won't complete you， obviously， but you're missing out， on a huge life experience， for real。

 okay， here's some other leverage too， and this is something I did， it's like we tend to。

 in a way be the， harshest on ourselves， ever， like our self-talk， is more negative。

 on ourselves than， anyone external to us， but paradoxically， we're also the most。

 lenient on ourselves， when it comes to， slacking off， you should have higher。

 standards and boundaries， so for example， in your 20s， 30s， 40s， not having options。

 or abundance with women， should be unacceptable， not having abundance， say of financial， situation。

 or freedom should be， unacceptable， you should not， tolerate that of yourself， you should not be。

 yourself down to the point， you're like oh I suck， myself at all， but it should be。

 unacceptable and just that， should be like enough， leverage， we tend to be like， it should be。

 fine when are you going to， decide when are you going to， decide you deserve more。

 because it's there， if you just go， fucking get it， if you realize it's。

 unacceptable you're going to， do something about it， that's something I， realized too。

 it's like thinking that， shit when I was 15， like oh we got to， bury her it's。

 unacceptable not having， options unacceptable， living a life on the， sidelines unacceptable。

 you're only here once， so how do you want to， live？， okay， so this here is where， you really got to。

 steer yourself， and that possibility， of ending up alone， okay， why two things。

 there's less and less， the need to actually， take right action， and grow nowadays， just because the。

 where society is， building we have all， these equipment and， you know stuff that do， things for us。

 you really don't have to， hustle anymore， we drown ourselves in， comfort and on the other。

 because of the internet， you don't really have to， you know it's like back in， the day you go home。

 we all have a need to， socialize we all do， you're home there's， nothing to do。

 how do you fulfill that， you go out， nowadays， you go online， post on a forum， you're virtually。

 fulfilling that need， play a video game， suddenly you have a， path in purpose， you level up。

 you have all these， different alliances， it's insane， you know， but it'll never， truly fill it。

 but it's easier to， just keep convincing， yourself you are， okay， it's like we're。

 more connected than， ever but we're， more alone than， ever too， and this is， something I also。

 noticed over the， years of teaching this， pretty crazy， now we all have， friends。

 but I'm not talking， about friends， through work， or friends you see， every day， I'm talking about。

 like close confidants， like friends， you can actually call， up， pour your heart， to say really。

 personal things， friends when you're， just really， know each other， on a deep level， you're just。

 really connected， talk a lot， most guys， don't， most guys， you just go home， drown yourself。

 in your computer， you have your， computer， someone， they're， the， head， you， understand。

 what you need， Are you willing to sacrifice to get there？， What are you willing to sacrifice？。

 And this is big， because once you made that pact， and you're like，， okay。

 I'm willing to sacrifice this，， suddenly there's no more resistance to it。， So for example。

 what are you willing to sacrifice？， I want some examples， what？， Time。， Time。， Boom okay。。

 Are you willing to sacrifice time？， The answer should be yes and then you should write down。

 how much time？， Okay， when that happens，， you make that pact， guess what？，《)？现在就3。70 экран市门梯，然后说。

請大家看看，更新的決選，以及現在形容也寪滿，更新就對了，很難應， stick to the basics， can do them over and over and over again。

 and all those little 1% will add on。， So way of life， you just commit to， and again， as a byproduct。

 you start seeing the results。， So here's all the motivation。 Then there's action。， Okay。

 and in this video， I actually tell you to stop the video and go out。， Okay， why？

 Because you need at least some references that you can then break down through these videos。。

 If you watch these videos without references to break down， you're fucked。。

 And if you can't take action， go back and get your head screwed on straight。， Approach anxiety。

 so on and so forth。 Okay， loving rejection。， Here's actually one interesting thing about rejection。。

 Who here feels bad when they get rejected？ Raise your hand。， Should be everyone。 You feel good？。

 Okay， raise your hand。 Raise your hand。， Well， here's what I'll say。。

 One of the big reasons we feel bad about rejection is why？。

 Because we are hanging on to this reality of no rejection。， You've been sold on a lie， on a dream。。

 With pickup， you'll master the skill where you'll get any girl， any way， any day， all the time。。

 You'll never happen。， Okay， let go of that reality of zero rejection。 It doesn't exist。

 and it shouldn't exist。， You've got to reinterpret your definition of rejection。。

 Who says rejection is bad？ Why is rejection bad？， There's a little question。

 You started to start questioning it。 Why is rejection bad？， I don't know。 Find a fun， fun， fun。

 and makes good face。， I don't mind it。， Okay， but most likely you still feel a little hurt inside。

 We all do。 Why？， Yeah， so you could just， I could have a good hopper。， There's like， like， one time。

 because I'm just a image that I want to achieve。， If you let it know， really。。

 How does it say both of me and what is it？ Like this and I probably contain me。， Yep。 Well。

 here's a few ones。， The first one is you got to question that interpretation or that label of bad。。

 Here's what I say。 I say it's bad if you don't get rejected。， Why？

 Because if you're going up to a girl and you're putting yourself out there，。

 congruently and authentically， should you get rejected？。

 Are there some girls who are not going to like you？， Yes， that's nature。

 That's the way it's supposed to be。， Some people， no matter what they do。

 you're not going to like them。， You're just not going to get along with them。， And vice versa。

 Some people， no matter what you do， they're not going to like you。， Ever。 And that's fine。

 That's natural。， You're going against nature trying to make everyone like you。。

 And that's not the goal here。， The only way to make everyone like you is to become this weird。

 manipulative，， and press and managing piece of shit。， Rejection。 You should have it。

 And the way you should view it is not being this people pleased。

 or trying to make everyone like you。， It's you going about putting yourself out there and just seeing who you get along with。

， If there's someone you don't get along with， there's no chemistry， that's fine。。

 At least you determine it fast。 It's sorting through the bullshit。

 and finding the people you're supposed to be with。， Stop chasing people you're not meant to be with。

， And that's crazy too。， There's a lot of girls trust me。 You won't like。， You think you will。

 They're high。 You're like， oh， they're so hot。， If you actually hung out with them in their personality。

 and you fucked them and looked for a validation， we're out of the way，， you would not like them。。

 Stop chasing them。 Why are you chasing them？， Question yourself there。 Why are you chasing them？。

 Why do you need them to like you？， Now here we can get deep two。， It's like why in the first place？

 Why do you need their approval？， What's so bad about not having their approval？。

 This is something you should do as well， by the way。， I call it following the trail of why。。

 It's like there's a surface layer。， This here can apply to sticking points。。

 So there's surface layer sticking point， which is say， I'm not a man to woman。。

 I run out of things to say。 Entitlement， etc。， etc。， You have to be aware of that。。

 But there's also the deeper layer。 That's the root。， And how do you get to that？。

 You ask yourself why。 You question it。， You're not a man to woman。 Why？， Oh， you know。

 I just feel like girls will reject me if I am。， Okay。 What's so bad about rejection？

 Why do you think that's bad？， Why do you fear rejection？ Why， why， why， why？。

 Do you want to know another comfort trap？， Not knowing what you're going to do differently at the end of this event。

， If you don't have a game plan of what you're going to change，， like up until this event。

 you've been doing things a certain way。， What are you going to do differently moving forward？。

 You don't know。 You're not going to get it better。， You're going to go， if you leave this event。

 you do the same thing as before。， You're still going to suck。 You're in a comfort trap。。

 Now what's the belief there？， We all think that if we go to enough events， we watch enough videos，。

 we'll be inspired enough。 The things will change。， Probably that's what you're hoping for here。。

 I'm so inspired。 Things will change。， And once I reach enough inspiration， I hit that threshold。。

 I'll be good。 You won't。， You don't know precisely what is you're doing different after this event。。

 This event was a waste of time。， I'm not helping you。

 I've just helped you mentally master day for three hours。， That's what I'm doing。

 Mentally jacking you off。 That's the seminar。， You should not come and thank me at the end。。

 You should not。， Now that's interesting。 So let's just say you flaking。。

 What are you going to do differently after this event？， What's your fucking video？， Good。

 So you can watch your review video。 What else？， Read a book。， Read a book。 How does that help？。

 We'll get any other content that will help you flaking them all。， We discussed that。

 Let's just say you do that。， Now what？， I'm trying to give this many followers。。

 This is like a year and a half。， What else？ Because that's very vague。， If you don't know now。

 what makes you think you're not going to know？， You're misthinking you're going to know in the future。

， Yeah， it's putting on the spot。， Well， you better figure it out。 What is it？。

 The seminar will not continue until I have a precise game plan。， So you started off right。。

 I'm going to watch all the content， read all these articles，。

 take notes of all the different things。， Okay。， What else？， Let's see your text。。

 Let's just ask another one。， How are you going to hold yourself accountable to do this？。

 How are you going to make sure you're going to do this？， Because this can't be New Year's Eve。。

 A lot of us， we treat these events like New Year's Eve。， You're all inspired now。 You're like， dude。

 I'm going to watch every fucking video。， I'm going to go out at seven nights a week。

 eight hours every time。， And then you leave and know how much。， Let's just start now。

 How much money do you have in your pocket？， 100 euros。 How much you need to get home tonight？。

 Give them 100 euros。， Give them 100 euros and let's come up with a precise game plan。， Now for you。

 what's your name？， What's your name？， You're the wing。。

 You're not allowed to give them those 100 euros back until he completes the tasks。， Oh。

 you're the wing man。， Give it to your wing。， And let's come up with a game plan that's sustainable。。

 Let's structure this。， From what time do you work？， From what time do you work every day？。

 Nine to five。， When are you going to watch the content on phone game？， Seven to nine。， Okay。

 for when？ What days？， Every day。， So every day from seven to nine。 Can you sustain that？。

 Seven to eight。， Can you sustain that？， Yeah， I can sustain that。， Okay。

 so seven to eight for the next seven days。， I'll give you a small one。。

 Then you can continue and you come up with your own goals。， So for the wing， and that's you， right？。

 Yeah。， Next Sunday， I'll give you six days。， Next Sunday， you can give them money back if he's done。

 an hour of content every single day。， Now you're going to take notes as well，。

 and you're going to send them the notes every single day。， So he has proof that you're doing this。。

 Now when are you going to go out to start field testing this content？。

 Usually we're out two or three answering。， Why not every day？， Why？， I don't know。。

 Is he going to go to the bathroom？， You were nine to five， though。。

 If you can do an hour of content a day，， you could easily replace that hour with an hour of going out every day。

， So you just already shot yourself in the foot for I can't every day。。

 So I'm going to have about a long， since then。， Yeah。

 you're going to have to go out every single day。， Now don't freak out here。。

 Usually what diets do you go out on the big nights for a long period of time？。

 Thursday for a few hours and then maybe Saturday。， Okay。

 so Thursday from what time to what time are you going to go out this week？， Are we coming up？。

 30 to probably 23。， Good， and Saturday？， I know what's the thing。， What about Friday？， No。

 that's not。， What do you do on Friday？， I'll stay on。， Why？， This week。

 go out at least an hour on Friday。， And on the other days， 20 to 30 minutes every day。。

 And you can split that。， You can do five minutes here， five minutes here， five minutes here。。

 But try to do 20 minutes every day。， Now to keep you accountable，。

 send him a picture of you and a girl every single day。。

 So he has proof that you're out talking to him every single day。。

 If you miss a report of notes or a mis-a-picture， you keep the money。， Okay？， Now building on that。

 once you have the notes，， I also want you to start applying what you wrote down。。

 Start field testing it， and you're also going to email him what exactly。

 and precisely you feel tested。， What happened？， And then go from there。， Did you give him money？。

 You're going to do it？， Good。， And then from there， when Sunday hits， you get the money back，。

 and then set new goals。， But you have to do this。， Now notice how it feels a little uncomfortable。。

 You're like， oh shit。， And most likely， everyone else here，。

 I can guarantee a lot of you don't even have a fucking plan。， Anyone here deal with self-emusement。

 for example？， Anyone who have trouble self-emusing？， You？， What are you going to do？， Actually。

 I got an answer today。， What？， Friends have told me already， but I think。

 gaming yourself is the gaming one。， To game myself is the key， not the girl。， So I will try to。。。。

 How？， It's too vague。， It's too。。。， Okay， so。。。， What are you going to precisely do moving forward？。

 Okay。， To self-emuse？， I will start doing conversations that make me amused。， What makes you amused？

， What are conversations that make you amused？， If you don't know， how are you going to find out？。

 Yeah， I have to find out what I like。， How？， What's the game plan to find out what you like。

 what you find funny？， Fingerball stuff。， The right long stuff that I。。。， I'm doing everyday。， Like。

 what I like to do。， How do I have fun？， When you're out talking to girls。， So that's step one。。

 At the end of every time you go out this week。， And same schedule as him。， Every day。。

 20 minutes and then longer on the weekends。， Write down things you said or did you found funny。。

 After the fact。， Not the cheat said。， Not the cheat did。， But you said you did。。

 You do this for 30 days。， Say you write down three things。， Every day for 30 days。。

 Now you have 90 things。， And then what do you do？， You categorize them。， Different themes。。

 Now you see all the buns to push。， What else？， So I。。。， So I had a certain。。。， Now notice here。。

 If we just ended the seminar and you left。， You have not gotten any better。。

 And this here should scare all of you shitless。， If you don't know what you're doing precisely moving forward。

， Good luck。， You may want to give up。， Like seriously， you'd be wasting your time。。

 So what are you going to do？， Probably into。。。， Precis。， Okay， precisely。。

 One that I talked about just here。， Pay your wing。， Give some money to your wing。。

 I need to actually do some of the exercises。， That could help， but what else？。

 Helps with finding subjects。， Bigger than that。， Pay your wing。， And tell them one night。。

 I'm not allowed to pull getting numbers。， How come so you're forced to self-immuse？。

 You're forced to get in touch with that。， Then you take notes。。

 How you can hold yourself accountable to this？， Who's your wing？， Actually， in the back。。

 How much money do you have in your pocket？， Don't give them too much to the point where you can't get home。

， But give them a sustainable amount。， Where， guess what？， Every day， similar to him。

 you're going to send a picture。， Every day， you're going to write down five things。

 you said or did you found funny。， And at the end of this week，。

 categorize them and try to find some of the buttons， some of the themes。， One night， on the weekend。

， tell them no polls， no numbers。， And get in touch with your actions。， And at the end of this week。

 you get the money back， and then kind of reevaluate how you're going to go moving forward。， Okay？。

 And lower the bar， too。， What you said or did you found funny doesn't mean stand-up comedy funny。。

 It could just be like， I asked her how old she was。， That could be funny。， Like， how old are you？。

 How high-five found that funny？， Whatever you found funny。， Okay？， Now this is huge。。

 And you should all be doing this。， Another big comfort trap，， kind of building on this here，。

 is waiting for the answer。， And not figuring shit out。， So for example， like with you， I'm like。

 what are you going to do？， I don't know。， Why are you waiting for the answer？。

 Imagine no one would ever give you the fucking answer。， What would you do？， Act like that。。

 Because that's a big one。， And you probably came to seminar waiting for an answer。， It's like。

 I just have this one fucking thing I need to figure out。， Help to and gives it to me。。

 And if you don't get it，， you're probably going to be a little happy inside。， Because like， hey。

 I went to the seminar。， It took action。， But I still don't have the answer。， Nothing I can do。。

 Figure it out。， You have to be the figure outer。， Figure out the answer。， I don't fucking know。。

 Imagine no one ever give it to you。， What are you going to do？， Act that way。， If you get it， cool。。

 It accelerates。， But don't wait。， Huge comfort trap。， We always underestimate our capabilities。。

 Like right now， if it's like，， well， I just want a lot of money。。

 You probably have enough money for more than you think。， If you were in jail。

 who do you fucking call？， You hustle around like a motherfucker to get the money to bail out， yeah。。

 If it's that serious， you'd find a fucking way。， If this is that serious to you。

 like you're in fucking jail，， you'd find a fucking way。， If you're not hustling about this。

 literally，， the same amount is you're in jail。， And this is actually very interesting。。

 And I love this analogy。， It's like， just think about it。， It's like， I tell this to someone。。

 It's like， I tell this to someone as a guy， he's like，， well， I don't know， you know。

 products pretty expensive。， Like， dude， you think， let's just say，， pimple shift would help you。。

 Yeah。， Why don't you get it？， Oh， the money。， You really， well， first of all。

 you really don't have 200 to 300 bucks。， In that case， like， fix your life。， And secondly。

 if this was in jail，， and your bail out was 300 bucks，， you would find a fucking way。。

 What does it really show？， You're a lack of commitment and lack of seriousness in the matter。。

 It should be a seven-year-old face， so I go， fuck。， We tell ourselves we take it seriously。

 we don't。， Life or death， that's how serious I have to get this shit。， That's why I'm here。。

 So I moved to America。， That's why I went all out。， For me， it was bail out of jail， serious。， Okay。

， Building on that。， Add a little bit more humor to this。， It feels like， oh， my God。。

 Experience over books。， Okay， the real game。， This is big。， Game is pre-verbal。。

 We talked about this before。， You'll never be able to put it into words。， All the videos。

 all the theory， has never defined what game is。， Ever。， And it never will。。

 Because game is only something you can emotionally recognize。， Never logically。， All the theory and。

 you know， concepts will point you in the right direction， but will never encompass it。。

 It's like freedom from outcome with the fuck is it？， You can only emotionally recognize it。。

 So you're talking to a girl。， You're attached to the outcome。， There's a certain vibe。， See。

 I come and say， hi， I'm not。， You'll sense a difference。， You're like， oh， shit。

 I need to be more like that。， See， you had to describe to him who didn't see what is that。。

 You can't put it into words。， That's where your RAS or focus should go on in the field。。

 Not on the words， not on the concepts on that deeper fucking layer。。

 On the shit you can't put into words。， On the feeling， on the emotion。。

 The same with a seminar like this。， There are two layers。， There's the content。

 which I hope you're learning from，， but there's also the vibe， the experience。。

 I know this because I go to seminars too。， And even watching a speaker。

 I'm listening to the content，， but it's like， there's also the whole fucking experience。。

 That's the deeper layer。， And I'm pretty sure this here is very different than me on YouTube。， Okay？

， And this is also why being a video jockey watching all this theory，。

 hoping to get it right before taking action，， will never work。。

 Because by watching all these videos，， thinking it will reach a point where you'll know enough to take action。

， is believing the game is logical。， But because it's emotional， it doesn't matter how much you know。

， You can only learn it through doing it， through experience。。

 And this will actually even stifle you even more。， For me， I've always been like， how to say。

 chasing a certain high，， if that makes sense。， It's like。

 even pick up in a ways of massive adrenaline rush，， just seeing how far I can push things。。

 And once you start going out， it's like， it started in game。， It's like， hey， get girls， push it。

 push it further， further， further。， And then I start getting tons of hot girls。。

 It's reached a point where being very honest and modest，， my dick could fall off now。

 and I never fuck a girl till the day I die，， and I'm completely fine。。

 I'm fucked more girls than I ever should。， No man ever should。， Now， I've reached that。

 and I'm okay， what's next？， And what will fuck with you more than just getting girls in validation from girls。

， is getting girls validation from girls， but then teaching it，。

 and having guys cheer you on for fucking girls，， and getting validation from guys and girls。

 and everyone around。， Okay？， It does fuck with you。

 and it fucked with me at first when I was first launched， as， you know。

 an instructor in traveling around and doing this。， This is like a few years ago。。

 And I remember at first I was like， oh shit， well now I'm view instructor，。

 do I have to live up to this？ Oh my god， and I had to go through a humbling phase， of being like。

 you know what？ No。， I'm just a guy like everyone else， I just take a fuck ton of action，。

 and hopefully I can inspire people with that，， and share some people， you know。

 the lessons that I've learned through taking so much action。， Now that happens， and you know。

 I humble myself for a while，， but then if you even take， and this is an example I love using，。

 the recent media scandal， okay？， If you look at me before the media scandal，。

 I pushed it to such a high， where I was literally having to start。， I'm like， I'm traveling around。

 got all the girls， got the girlfriend，， got an awesome job， doing what I love， got the money。

 what's next？， Okay， and as you said， like right now you're like， what's next？。

 You can't find the same joy in it， and you'll probably find elsewhere，， you know。

 in terms of stimulus， find ways to make you feel happy。， Now， in my example。

 if you look at even some of the videos leading up to it，。

 it was the ultimate form of just like external stimulus through validation。， You know。

 I've made a video about this on my new YouTube channel，， which check it out， Julian himself， okay。

 YouTube。com slash Julian himself。， And I basically said that if you saw those videos，。

 like let's say you take the one in Japan， okay？， Is there anything really to learn from that video？。

 Not really。， If you take the Disfaddy's video， is there really anything to learn from it？， No。

 it was more so， check out this shocking shit， you know，， and then getting the spike in reactions。

 just，， amping up the validation external stimulus。， Now。

 the world will find a way to humble you when you get into that frame there，， okay。

 and this was kind of the process I went to where，， you know， with the whole media thing。

 like everything kind of just crumbled。， You know， it's like you just lose everything。。

 It's like you have all this validation high and it's like gone。。

 And it forces you to get back to your roots， if you will。， Okay。

 and this is kind of where I'm getting out of this point here。， It's like here you are。

 you're focused on like I'm getting the girls，， I'm not getting the same high。。

 A lot of it is actually sitting down and asking yourself，。

 why do you even get into this in the first place？， Not from a validation point of view。

 but like what was the love？， What was the drive？ What were your core values getting into this，。

 and getting back in touch with that internally？， And that's what I did。。

 It's like everything was crumbling， and when everything crumbles，。

 you realize what's important to you。， And for me， you know， just in terms of living my life，。

 and I do this to help people， but it's also very selfish。， For me， it's just putting shit out there。

， It's like self-expression in a way where I want to have a positive impact on people's lives。， Okay。

 now it sounds cheesy， but guess what？， And this is， if you want to get a little deeper，。

 this is my view of life。， The quotes I kind of live by is， no one gets out of here alive。。

 That's my view。 It's like， look， you're going to die at some point。， It doesn't matter what you do。。

 Whatever you accomplish， whatever you resources， you accumulate，， you can't take it with you。。

 You can't get out of here alive。， Okay， so in a way， life， again， this is my personal view，。

 is detention。， Here's stuck here。， Now you have two choices。， You have many choices。， You can。

 again， check out early。， You can slack off。， You can be miserable。。

 You can accomplish a bunch of stuff， but there's no point。， Even in terms of legacy。

 and this is something I bought in two for a while，， it's like， legacy。

 it doesn't fuck a matter because guess what？， You die。。

 You really care when you're dead about your legacy。， No。。

 And the world and sun will explode and your legacy will be gone。， So ultimately。

 the same as in an interaction。， It's your here， your suck here。， What do you want to do？。

 What will make this an enjoyable experience？， And in terms of human emotion， okay。

 the best feeling is sharing。， We're helping people。。

 It's like giving a gift versus receiving the gift。， So it kind of got me back to core with that。。

 It got me back to core。， It's like， you know what？， Letting go of that validation。。

 You kind of get disgusted by it。， It gets back to core。。

 It's just been like extremely just real humble。， No fronts。。

 Finding ways to just make yourself feel at ease。， Putting videos out。。

 And that was the one thing I really missed during that period。， And then coming out of it。

 it's like you look at me now， you know，， in a way， even if you look at the videos。

 it's a complete change。， And I'm happier now than I have been for years。， Okay， so for you。

 it's more so， yeah， you've got all the girls。， But remind yourself。

 why did you get it into it the first place？， Okay， let go and snap out of validation。。

 Why are you in this？， Think back even in terms of motivation。， It's like， you know。

 is it to have a positive impact on girls？， Even if you get back in touch with that， like， for。

 you know，， an interaction is a way of just me freely expressing myself。

 and having a positive impact on someone。， You start focusing that way versus on， okay。

 I got the girl。， What else can I get？， Make the switch to more so giving。， It sounds cheesy。

 but it's kind of like just redefining it， and stepping out of that validation there。。

 And you'll refine that same fucking joy， you know。。

 And this happens to guys and pick up all the time，， and this is why I talk about the video。。

 It's like you lose that initial love， especially with the pickup，， how to say it。

 the terminology and the different mentalities。， You know。

 it's like so much of pickup in a way is seeking validation。， You know， it's like you get into this。

 it's like， okay，， how many girls you fucked？， That determines your worth。。

 How many times you get rejected？， That determines your worth。， And you're just like， oh， validation。

 validation， validation。， You lose touch with why you originally got into this before you。

 and found out about this whole community。， What were your intentions there， you know？。

 You also can kind of lose the love of it， if you will，。

 by just doing it so much that it starts just becoming robotic repetition。

 and kind of just like a means to an end，， and you lose your soul that way。， So for you。

 and this would， again， this is my recommendation，， it's just like。

 actually sit down and start thinking about this， and being like， you know what， I got the girls，。

 and what way is courteous it sounds？， Can I like change my drive to something that's giving。

 or sharing， if you will？， Be it just sharing fun， sharing an awesome， you know，。

 impact on someone's life through a relationship，， whatever it may be， just putting myself out there。

， like， why do you originally get into it and get back to those roots there？

。
