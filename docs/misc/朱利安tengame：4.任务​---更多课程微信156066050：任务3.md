we're going to keep the going out every single day，meaning do you been doing 14 day stream so far。

we're going to extend that to 21 day straight，okay so for the next seven days。

go out every single day for a minimum，以上時間增長，但利率，預約不到，之後撮入，馬上表演，人生都說，我們就是，我們 thirst  Quickly，要攝影，未如。

沒問題，我沒忽然，請你，寰弱，慢慢，孕口，有，反應，在，你的，本台，期能，關 For，你的，你的，把，能，位置，OK， so this does mean eliminate questions。

 you are still going to have a lot of questions。， It just means figure it out。， OK。

 so let's just say you go out this week and something happens。， You're like， oh。

 you know this happened， instead of just jumping on the forum，。

 like any little question comes to mind and posting your question，， like， what do you think？

 What's the answer？ Ask yourself，， what would I do right now if I knew no one would ever give me the answer？

， Hmm， and then act accordingly。， OK， you'd probably go online and look up different resources。。

 You'd probably go through the product， try to find， hmm， maybe this， maybe this。。

 You'd probably feel test different things。， Or you'd probably have the answer and you're like， oh。

 I guess I trust that it's this。， No one will ever confirm it。

 It's up to me to confirm it and start building that authority。， So no fucking questions。 OK。

 instead I want you to write the question that you have， and comment below how you figured it out。

 That's your challenge。， OK， it's like how to answer your own fucking questions and build that personal authority。

， That's the mindset I want us to work on。 OK， now on top of that，， going out seven days a week。

 30 minutes every single day，， I want you to get five phone numbers this week。 OK。

 we focused on logistics last week。， Try to keep that going。 OK， keep the logistic habit going。。

 But we're going to add the phone numbers， meaning that I want you to try to get five numbers。， Now。

 when getting a number， there are five steps。 OK， step one， talk about the day two。， OK。

 make sure you talk about when you're hanging out again。， If it's going to be later that night。

 the next day， it's like， hey， when are you free？， Let's hang out。 OK。

 you want to be clear in your intentions here。， Let her know why you're getting her number。

 It's not just a pity number。， It's not because someone told you in a video to do it as a challenge。。

 It's because you want to see her again。 That's step one。， Step two。

 make sure she remembers your name。， A lot of girls will forget。， Step three。

 pull your phone out during or before。， Don't be like， oh， can I have your number？， OK， thank you。

 And then take your phone out。， Assume she already said， yes。 Hey， what's your phone number？， OK。

 try to keep it casual as well。， Step four， try to be discreet。 OK。

 don't put it on the spot in front of all her friends。

 and become an obstacle to her goal of not seeing like a slut。， And step five。

 text her your name immediately after。， OK， I want you to do this minimum five times this week。， OK。

 that's your challenge。， On top of that， there's two more things I want you to do。， Every single day。

 try to open a mix set。， OK， what's a mix set？ That's a group of guys and girls or one guy， one girl。

， There has to be a guy in the group。， OK， I want you to train yourself to not look for those easier opportunities。

 where you're just looking for like a girl by herself， a girl in her friends，。

 or like these situations that seem like， oh， nothing can go wrong here。

 and just avoiding scary or situations。， OK， I just want you to learn how to feel ideas in every fucking situation。

， And that means going up to groups where there's a fucking guy。， OK。

 and I want you to get some references that nothing bad will happen。， OK。

 we tend to overgrow things in our mind。， We're like， oh， my God， there's a guy。， Most of the time。

 a guy is just like you or me。， OK， it's like， how would you act if some guy came up and talked to you？

， Would you fucking freak out？ No。， OK， so the challenge is every single day， open a mix set。。

 But don't actively hit on the girl。， Just open with small talk。 That's your goal。。

 I just want small talk with a mix set。， OK， just like fucking 30 seconds。， Like， hey。

 venue's pretty cool， right？， Yeah， cool。， Anyway， hope you're having a great night。， Bye。

 Just like that。， OK， just getting those references，。

 maybe stepping your way there and just proving to yourself，， hey， nothing fucking bad happened。， OK。

 and the last thing I want you to do，， and this is more on the self-emusement side，。

 is try to see in an interaction how many times you can say like a dog。， OK， subtly without， say。

 the person noticing。， So if you go up to a girl， you're like，， yeah， how's it going？。

 What's your name？， She's like， oh， my name's Jessica。， You're like， oh， that's cool。 Like a dog。。

 What do you do？， See if you can just subtly， oh， yeah， like a dog。， What do you do？， Oh。

 that's awesome。 Like a dog。， What do you say？， Oh， nothing like a dog。， OK。

 just see how many times you can slip that in。， The whole purpose here is， again，。

 to kind of bring that fun to the interaction，， it's not the like a dog that's going to get the girl。

， The whole purpose is you kind of just learn to laugh at it。， You laugh at yourself。。

 It's this inside joke with yourself。， So just give yourself a little challenge。。

 Like how many times can you subtly slip in the words， like a dog in an interaction？。

 That's Mission 3。， Good luck。。
