 and have a great hangover， in real time， and having a great break， and having a good time。

 and having a good hangover， because you spend your whole arts， for having a lot of different。

 things， and having an energy， is an opportunity， to spend more time， in real time， in real time。

 and having a good time， in real time， in real time， in true time， in real time。

 and having a good time， even having a good time， to have an energy，不是把他贼成，我调想，脑子在地上。

再 get to the 9th and 10's， so that I can save night lay， within that social skill。

 I'm not not really， That's not altruistic， I'm not here to make a lot of friends， Ya know。

 You can make a lot of friends with it， I mean I don't want to have the room walk out the door。

 when I'm like， Oh I'm not here to make friends， To tell you like when I say。

 I don't care about happiness， or I care about success more than happiness， Right？。

 I did a Nashville talk， And was like， talking like an hour longer。

 because half the room was just like， Wait， what？， What are you talking about？。

 Happiness is the goal and everything， I'm just like， well， I'm just kind of happy all the time。

 Like especially when you build your social club over time， Every month it goes by。

 you'll see that you just get， Think about it， how much more happy are you？。

 How much happier are you if you get 10 invites to cool parties this week。

 And you didn't have that last week， You're more validated， you feel it， right？。

 It happens with no game， you just suddenly， your state is better。

 So I use my social circle long-term benefits， To increase just my overall satisfaction。

 my overall well-being， Most of those events I don't even go to。

 But knowing that I break up with a girl， I can just immediately get another one within a few hours。

 This is a cool event that most people can't even get into， That's something that increases my mood。

 right？， But for me personally， I'm using social circles stuff， To fuck that girl that night。

 And then maybe I'll meet some cool people out of it， But I'm using it at a very short-term basis。

 Not if you're doing it properly， The way to do it properly to get started， right？。

 Is you build as many individual social circles as possible。

 And you treat them as circles that are like spinning， Right。

 so right now I have like 12 to 15 social circles happening at once。

 Two of them are super strong and the rest are just kind of existing。

 But there's always a lot of overlap between them， And I don't even。

 that's like how I met Damwell's here， right？， I had like five social circles that were happening。

 I didn't know how it was going to happen， But I knew if I just could put these in place。

 Within several months， I was going to be at his house， And then once I'm there。

 I knew that the other social circles， Right， there's the effect that would happen， Where it's。

 there's just randomly be talking about， For this guy named Frank， right？， I go。

 you mean Frank Napoleon？， Or Napoli？ He's like， yeah， yeah， how do you know Frank？。

 I know Frank for a while， yeah， And like， I'm not trying to pretend like I know him a lot more than I do。

 I'm just like， yeah， I know him not too well， This is one of the keys to doing this whole。

 There's this like aggressive people arbitrage that you can do。

 That a lot of people will fuck this up， And they'll just say that they know the person really。

 really well， I want to， I mean， I have a friend who will do this。

 And he won't even know the person at all， he will never even met them。

 And then he'll just like climb through friends circles。

 And eventually he knows like the king of that social group， And like five people are pissed。

 but it doesn't matter， Because you already met the king of the group， And he just， I mean。

 that's not really my style， But it works really well for him。

 What I like to do is start these different social circles， And he's like kind of peripheral areas。

 And then what ends up happening is the effect， Where if you do fuck up。

 What ends up happening is you are so known in that group， And every。

 there's like a two degree of separation， That sucks you back in。

 And it's like a very forgiving kind of net， Does that make sense？， It's pretty wild， When you。

 like you can fuck up a lot of shit， And then like I've almost been kicked out of many， many clubs。

 Right， and Vegas and Miami so especially， But like I always have a couple degrees of separation。

 Away from like a manager and the owner， I don't know either one that well。

 But like everyone knows that I kind of know both， So that overlap gives me like a immense value。

 Does that make sense？， Yeah， And I take advantage of that overlap all the time。

 Social game is not a when the thing happens， Right。

 it's not a when I meet the guy who wants to buy the bottles， I'll then introduce him to the GM。

 It's that's what turns it into a very quick opportunity for you。

 I will decide that if I want to fuck this cocktail atress， I need the manager to like me。

 Because what is that manager trying to do？， Trying to fuck the cocktail atress。

 So at least I need him to let me stay in the club at our past clothes。

 Well they do this weird thing called inventory， I don't even know what that is but it takes forever。

 And it's the biggest cock block ever if you fucking hire guns， right？， So what ends up happening is。

 If I need to meet that guy， I'm not gonna go through life being like， Oh。

 you know when I meet a guy who wants to buy bottles， I'm gonna go up to a guy and I'm gonna say， Oh。

 get lit， You want another one， don't you？， And he's like， what did you say？ I said another one， Oh。

 you're so funny， I know right？， Yo， let's do it， And I'll make him drink his whole bottle of alcohol。

 It's 12。30 and I guess what he's gonna do， He's gonna buy another bottle， And then I'm just like。

 oh you know what？， Hey， I can hook you up， I know the manager。

 Even if like you've never met him before， He's not gonna call you out and not knowing the manager。

 As guys， we have these like high expectations of the labels that we put on things。

 And how we know people， No， you know because you see you have， You have。

 you at least have his name right？， And nobody looks like， I'm saying even if you don't。

 even if you don't， Let's make this， I want to make this very controlled。

 So let's take these cool factors out of it a little bit， You go up to that guy。

 you are just have a little bit of gregariousness， Right？， Now the reason。

 it seems like a lot of work， But all of a sudden once you do these like three steps。

 You know at that table you have a spot to sit， It's not about you but like I'd rather sit in game。

 Like when my real game I'm sitting in one spot， And I'm like looking over left and right I'm gaming。

 Right？ Because there's no hotter girls anywhere else。

 There's no point in me running around the club because the hotter girls are right here in front of me。

 Right？， So by doing these like two to three things with the whole manager thing that he just did。

 He avoids him having to go off and now do all this other work。

 I think it's a lot more work to run around the club and like succeed or fail， succeed or fail。

 succeed or fail， Now these intertwined with this guy with the bottle， with the manager。

 He tells the manager that now the manager is not going to cock lock him。

 Because he got a sail for him right？， And now you're at that table and now the guys are going to introduce you to the eight girls that are at the table。

 So now you're going to eight introductions， accomplish introductions right？， No wing。

 what wing is going to do that for you in one night right？， And now you're。

 they set you firmly up against that table because you're kind of running shit， Okay。

 so you're up in the back， you know you do the table seat which is where you sit up on top， Right？。

 And again， if all you guys who are might be thinking。

 you know that you don't want to do the whole table thing or whatever。

 Then you're just not going to game hot enough girls， You know。

 there are just aren't hot girls that are going to places that don't have at least some VIP type of area。

 Right？， And if it's not a table， it's a VIP area with the wristband， Right？。

 Like Seattle's all with the wristbands， There's other places that are。

 you have their own VIP area right？， But it's all about being in that area because that's where the。

 that's the whole point of what these girls are trying to do， They're trying to get to that area。

 So if you're already there， you employ what's called barried entry game right？。

 So barried entry game is something that I realized a long time ago that the harder thing that I'm doing first makes everything else easier。

 The bigger the barried entry is of what I'm trying to do， the maximum party right？， When I。

 the first maximum party I went to， I was， I had staff pass， Because the VIP pass wasn't good enough。

 so I wanted to make sure I got a staff pass， Which then got me like in the back and I could hit on everybody。

 I go start with Nick Jonas and we're up there， I mean like， I literally had a certain。

 but I have an infield of him filming me， Filming Nick Jonas and all the girls， well I'm like。

 I don't know anything about cameras， But I have my， I mean these are all， you know。

 I have my cameras for my RSD， you know， my day job right？， So I'm up there on the maximum stage。

 being a videographer， filming up and all these girls chilly right？， I'm like。

 up and all of it and then I'm like， Twork girl， you want a Burke and you better start Twork in。

 Half the time the thing's not even fucking on， Like I don't know， like it's over-expo。

 Like the fact that any of it actually made it in the final reel blew my mind， Like I don't。

 I literally have no idea what I'm doing with it， I'm like， I so， why is this so bright？， Alright。

 I'll spin it the other way， And then I'm like， wait， there's a girl who's like。

 like the meanwhile the whole time， This girl's just like。

 like doing all these like slutty dance moves in front of me because I have a camera， I'm like。

 oh I'm paying attention to the wrong thing， So then I just start going like this and she's getting all slutty and then what do I do？

， I say， hey， do you want to come look at the footage later？， She's like， yeah， oh， could I？

 I go of course， So I do， I pop the fucking card out and then I get her number， Alright？

 I didn't end up closing that girl， there was like a stampede on the exit。

 But she works at town Vegas so I'm still， she's still on the hook。

 But she's one of those bodybuilder chicks， Every other time I see her， she's overweight。

 You know what I'm talking about？， Every other time I see her， I'm like， God， you're so sexy。

 you're ass， And every other time， I'm like， who are you？， Yes， she's bulky and I don't know。

 You want me to ball？， Yeah， I'm in this space， Okay， so I taught Michael this game， right？。

 This social game and he's taken this way further than I have， I mean。

 I like to do more than my life， I mean， he's already rich， so like I'm not there。

 It's like I have shit I'm doing， right？， But he's rich， so he。

 and he doesn't spend any money on anybody， And he is completely sober and zero alcohol in his life。

 So he's fitting this very weird niche， If a guy who goes out five minutes a week doesn't drink。

 Doesn't spend any money but has more money than everybody， Like it's a very， you know。

 like his couch is like this old ratty couch， His apartment's like， you know。

 like 1500 for a two bedroom， I mean， it's Vegas， right？， But I mean。

 the point is like he could be buying everybody drinks and he just doesn't。

 Buy him his own drinks either， zero alcohol， Like， not， not， huh？。

 We're taught that like weird hair， Yeah， yeah， that's the video Mike is， yeah。

 He's the biggest sweet， Yeah， yeah， he's my best friend， So， yeah， I built up all my。

 I built up a lot of my social circles in Scottsdale， Atlanta， I mean， yeah， I mean。

 he helped me with a lot of girls， Yeah， I mean， so there are a calculator。

 anybody ever see boys and girls guys getting down？， Yeah， how awesome and horrible is that movie？。

 Like every PUA should， I mean every PUA should watch that and spread， right？， Spread？

 And that's the number one movie every PUA should watch， Spread？ Originally， if you're seeing spread。

 come on Jared， okay， Of course， it's Ashton Kutcher playing a pickup artist。

 If Ashton Kutcher was a pickup artist， Ashton Kutcher is the PUA technical advisor for the show for the movie。

 That's amazing， Like， yeah， I make every one of my Vegas month-long guys watch it， at least once。

 It's amazing， it's perfect， it's the only Hollywood movie that you can be like， Oh， yeah。

 I'll do all of that and I'll get laid， I'll get laid， huh？， Ashton Kutcher and Ataq？。

 I don't know the girl， She's like a cousin of Scarlett Johansson kind of， kind of。

 The reason I mention that is there's a thing called the Quango Principle。

 In the boys and girls got to getting down， there's always funny， like， like。

 calculations for how much alcohol you should buy， And what you should tip and all these funny。

 it's like a 30 minute explanation on it， It's kind of ironic if you see it， But， the alcohol thing。

 Here's the thing， it all depends on how much money you're willing to spend and what type of lifestyle you're willing to live。

 Right？， Anybody here are lawyer， doctor， professional。

 type of type of setup like you're decent and you don't mind drinking。

 And you want to fuck some girls， I mean， like， I already looked at you like。

 and the guy in the white shirt， I've been looking at you like on this one for a while， Like。

 what do you do？ What do you lawyer， doctor？ What do you。。。， I do marketing for law firm， Okay。

 so similar， professional type shit， Okay， cool， cool， And this is like， you know。

 for the three people in the room， right？ The rest of the seminar is only going to be for you three。

 I want you to understand that this is an example and then we'll extrapolate it into all of your guys' different situations that you have。

 Right？， And eat it with yours， because you asked the question。

 I have guys in my life who are some of the best wings of mine that they're entirely。。。

 I have the guy who's the。。。， My buddy， he's the bottle guy who doesn't want comps。

 he'd be offended if you even got him a comp， He wants to buy two to three bottles。

 every night he goes out， Not crazy， he's not ballin' out， but he owns a dental practice。

 I think if I had his kind of money， I don't think I would be spending this kind of money on bottles。

 But it's something he enjoys， he's got these bright blue contact lenses， And he fucks。。。

 he's this tall， he's Indonesian or Indian， Something like that， and he's。。。

 he fucks hot girls in all of his rooms combined， He wears blue colored contacts。

 he gets really drunk， He always has girls at his house。

 he always brings the athletic back and he rails girls， like it's crazy。

 But he plays this angle of like， he's a professional， right？。

 Everyone knows he's got a day job professional， he's very responsible during the day。

 But then you can always find him at the bar just smashing shots。

 but he's like giving shots away freely， My buddy， Johnny。

 owns one of the biggest personal injury law firms in the South， He's like， literally the best。。。

 like him and his wife， I went to his wedding， My first infield pickup on my RSD Luke channel is that his wedding。

 So him and his wife literally just go and try to fuck as many strippers and cocked waitresses and girls as well。

 They'll go on vacation and just feel like text me on the girls they both rail together。

 Like he's just awesome， and like his whole deal is he will get。。。 he just loves alcohol。

 He'll get drunk with his。。。 like with his individual people that are at the bar。

 he's never met before， He's just like。。。 but the thing for him is he's just like giving away freely。

 And he looks at it like it's networking as well， so for。。。

 I mean I don't do quite the way that he does it， But he'll do like， you know， five， ten shots。

 oh cool， here you， here， here go for it， And then like he'll just turn his back and then go back to what he was doing。

 Right？ Again， that's not really applicable or practical for most of the guys in this room。

 But that's a good like。。。 it's a good like bench mark， then pull ourselves back from。

 Because you also don't want to be the guy who like literally goes into the club。

 And then like you avoid the bar at all costs， I mean。

 and you guys ever feel that way where you go away because I've done this。

 Where like I knew that I wasn't gonna spend a dollar in the place。

 And then I just like kind of like walked around and I like every time I make eye contact with the bar。

 And I was like， no I'm good， I'm like， oh no I'm good。

 And again I'm not trying to get you guys to spend money， I just want to show you like。

 Like these different paths that you can take here， right？， And again。

 a lot of this comes down to you， you see that nine or ten。

 You pull it all the fucking stops that you're willing to pull out， Right？

 So that you don't pull out， Oh， right？， You know， you don't do this on the 5s to 7s， Like， you know。

 like there's no way on earth I would ever like take a shot with a 6， Like I'm good。

 I'm not gonna put that stupid shit down my throat， Right？

 If you're willing to buy at least one drink per night， Right？ Because then what do you do？

 You buy a bottle of water， Or you buy soda water from the gun with a lime， Right？

 Both have their veg and disadvantages， But let's not pretend like。

 let's not pretend like that's not going to always make your game better， Right？ Now again。

 if you don't want to spend the money， like it's a kind of answer question， You can spend zero。

 right？， But you have to realize that when you go to that bar。

 you're not gonna be able to use that as social proof as much， Right？ So which is fine。

 you just have to realize that that's the game that you're playing， You understand？ Cool， Ideally。

 what you do is you create this hub against the bar， Right？ So first of all。

 you want to do the triangle pattern， We cover a lot of random tangential stuff。

 I want to cover some brassacks stuff for you guys， When I walk into a place。

 when I say what I do as well， by the way， this is like an actual ideal situation。

 This isn't what I do every time， this is like， hey， perfect night， this is how it's gonna go。

 But I'll probably forget， like you said， it's a lot of fucking work。

 I'm probably not gonna do the full 100%， I'm gonna get like， in two of the。

 I'm probably gonna do 50% and the rest I'm just gonna forget about。

 So what I do is when I walk into that bar， I wanna know what I'm doing every minute of the night for the entire duration of the night。

 Unless I'm trying to do the opposite and just let loose with my buddies。

 but then it's not a game kind of thing， Right？ You understand this？ So what I do。

 I pick three points when I go into the bar， And this is gonna sound super analytical， by the way。

 Right？ The first， after a few times doing this， you just forget about it and you just naturally be doing it。

 Your intuition will kick in， You pick three points。

 so I pick the entryway usually at the bar and the bathroom。

 If I pick those three points and I open along the left and the right of these three points。

 It looks like I'm going somewhere， I'm not doing the whole fucking bubblehead thing， Right？

 The PUA bubblehead， we're like， you see a girl over here， you look over here。

 and then you kinda walk over here， You pick those three points， you just kill all those problems。

 it'll never happen again， Okay， You can't build any social-go-game or cold approach game at that point if you're doing this whole like。

 oh， where do I go now？， I don't know where I'm going， Right？ And be over following that trap？。

 Right？ I mean， all of us have some point in time， right？

 Where you don't really know exactly what your path is for the night， You pick those three points。

 you open along those three points， you're gonna have not only a path that you hit once。

 So it looks like you're doing everything on purpose， because you are doing things on purpose。

 But what ends up happening is you get the mere exposure effect to kick in。

 Where you end up reopening， sets over and over and over again， right？

 Which should be super familiar to you， right？， Jared？， Oh， yeah， Meer exposure？ Cool， cool。

 It has like a cornerstone of those guys， Meer exposure， Meer exposure is not only these funny。

 scientific things that actually build attraction a lot more than， like， feel it。

 Know that you're attractive， you are enough， Cool， so ask it up here just so we can， yeah。

 just so we can keep everybody on the， because we have a small group。

 we can keep everyone on the same page， Meer exposure is super simply。

 you just see the person over and over and over again and it builds up comfort attraction over time。

 Just because you merely expose yourself to them over and over and over again， not expose yourself。

 expose yourself， I had one guy once， I know， Okay， What you're doing is one guy literally， I mean。

 many guys actually have exposed it， now they think about it， let's get back to the thing， right？。

 So， categories of openers， right？ There's six categories of openers you could possibly do， right？。

 I have a video about it， just look up on my channel， there's six categories of openers。

 I put direct on there， even though I don't do direct that often， I put direct on there。

 because I do do it， And it's a valid one that you guys can do， right？ You understand。

 the nightclub is an arcade， like it's a game， So even though if you go direct and like you。

 you failed， like go to the bathroom， come back， and she might completely have changed her tune。

 And you can just reopen direct again， I probably wouldn't， but you easily could。

 like it'd be funny and might work， Right？ The， like the Nintendo reset button happens throughout your night many。

 many times， Right？ All of a sudden she got a text。

 all of a sudden her Tinder date's not going to be here， All of a sudden she had， you know。

 half a shot， and it was something that she didn't want。

 All of a sudden her friend came or this or that， and then suddenly your direct open used 30 minutes ago。

 As guys we think that like she meant all the stuff she said， Right？ Yeah。

 It's like they all have an amnesia， But like repetitive persistent amnesia every few seconds， Right？

 Exactly， But you can use this to your advantage， right？

 So my favorite type of opener is a very suggestive component opener。

 Based on something she's worked for retained， Right？ Yeah， With a walk away。

 like so I have a pretty structured game if I'm going to do like my real perfect game， Right？

 Like if I'm doing so I have a huge bet， it's a six figure bet。

 Which is hopefully going to go well in my favor， And it's a bet that is going to have a lot of publicity。

 Basically on me having an ability to fuck a certain amount of girls that somebody else picks。

 It's going to be pretty interesting， So I basically like popped off and I was like yeah I could fuck 50% of girls that I meet。

 Like in a Starbucks and there's a bunch of people at the table that are at the area that I was in。

 That were big as like a dinner table and I called them。

 And they were like well fuck that shit I don't believe you I don't believe you。

 And I go nah I do it like we can do it， And they go shit and we've got the cameras out。

 we film this whole thing， So we're just picking like which Starbucks is going to be。

 We're going to go in and like do this whole thing， I have to fuck the girl within four weeks。

 So each one， right？ So it'll be a whole interesting kind of bet。

 So when I have a bet like that or something that I know I have a massive outcome dependence。

 I'm going to open as low risk， lower risk is possible， Because I want to catch all。

 I'm literally going to walk up and I'm going to do Adams line， Do you know what the Starbucks is？。

 Do you know what the cream is？ Do you know the sugar？。

 I'm literally asking me super boring and simple， Because I know that if I can do that。

 And I get just one bit of feedback back to me， She says one thing to me。

 I can build that up from there and I can build the attraction then close。

 But if I go direct and she's just not into it or even if she isn't into it。

 It puts too much pressure on her and she doesn't， she doesn't vibe with it， Right？ I'm fucked。

 there's not really anywhere I can go from there， Right？ I could leave and come back I guess。

 But you know the daytime it doesn't work as well， Very super simple， right？， So super simple。

 Ideally you do the double take， you walk past the girl， When they say thanks。

 it sucks you back to the conversation， So ideally you're like holy shit， amazing shoes。

 I love the way they match your belt， keep it up， You walk away， she says， Thanks， Oh wow。

 you're actually really friendly， where are you from？， There you go， okay。

 And then the whatever answer she says， you tease aggressively on， And I usually。

 I'm super suggested with it， Right？， So the whole point of what I'm doing is trying to flip the script。

 And get her to invest in me as quickly as possible。

 Without it being this long drawn out thing where I'm trying to pump value。

 Or do all these other things， Right？， If you're walking away， are you needy or not needy？。

 Not needy， Right？， The beautiful part of that line， right？， Is the， you're actually really friendly。

 where are you from？， It's called a positive frame， right？， But the qualifier。

 So why you're actually really friendly， where are you from？。

 She's going to be really friendly for the next sentence that she said。

 Because you dictated that she was going to be friendly， And the thing is this。

 like the problem with that， or I mean that， that works really well， And I see why you do that。

 But you're going to understand there's going to be lots of girls who are genuinely nice。

 That just aren't nice to the random guy that they meet， Right， So like。

 none of these girls are bitches， Or at least if they are bitches。

 you're not going to know it in a few seconds， Right？， And even the seriously， you're not。

 Because even if， a lot of times it's the inverse is also true。

 A lot of times some of the biggest bitches and horrors are super nice at first。

 Just because they're fake nice， right？， So like， you never really know。

 basically the point is you don't know for sure within 30 seconds。

 So you shouldn't really be judging if the girls are nice or not right away， Right？。

 The cool thing about this type of opener is that immediately you're going to start disqualifying aggressively。

 Which means you're putting her in the friend zone， Right？。

 So when you put her in the friend zone and you're being sexually suggestive verbally。

 That means that you have the option to pull her that night。

 Or just put her in your longer term pipeline for your social circle， Is that understand？， Yeah。

 Cool， So a very simple one， right？， A good framework would be why you're actually really friendly where you're from。

 She says Texas and you say， Are you like everybody from Texas？， Yeah， are you like。。。。

 True what to say， Yeah， I mean that's an easy framework， Oh。

 is it true they say but girls from Texas？， I mean I think it says the free to her， right？。

 Like I don't have her know， like I don't have an answer to back that up with。

 Like if she pressures me on it， I have no idea， I don't know， But then I push。。。， But then I push。。。

， I'm like， oh it's fucking true isn't it？， I knew it！， Right， I mean you just call them out of it。

 right？， Yeah， Like the more that she fights back， the more that she must really be that thing， Yeah。

 so the friend thing， so I'm the king at getting people out of the friend zone。

 Because I determined if I'm going to be a social circle guy， I also need to be a。

 Let's fuck your friend's guy， Does that make sense？。

 To the point where any girl that I fuck within minutes after where I say， Oh。

 do you want to go to brunch？， And she goes every girl wants to go to brunch at any point of the day。

 right？， And doing as much traveling as I do sometimes I'm warped on time。

 So sometimes it'll be like midnight， I'll be going to go to brunch。

 And like I'll meet a girl like Cincinnati and she's like， do you？， What？， So anyway with you， right？

 With your situation， You have to be super sexual， I guess the kind of encapsulated I was just saying。

 It's really funny because I'll actually have a rule that any girl I fuck， I'll fuck her friends。

 When I say let's go to brunch， the whole point is for me to date to her girlfriends， Right？

 I'm literally doing network marketing pussy， I'm trying to drive to the network， And you say like。

 how are you going to be？， Is that kind of apply？ Like bring your friends？， No， no， no， no， no。

 there's no implication， I say， do you want to go to brunch？ I get that yes ladder， she says yes。

 I go， amazing， bring your friends， And she goes， what？ I go， who's your best friend？。

 And like this time I'm still like， like， I'm like， I'm like， I just pulled out of it， I'm like。

 yeah， you want to go to brunch？ I'm like， I'm just kind of hungry for it， I want some eggs， right？

 And then she goes， well my best friend's stacey， I go， what's she doing right now？ I don't know。

 And she's like， and she goes， you know what？ I think she actually was on a Tinder day， I go。

 let's see how bad it went， That's always fun， and she goes， oh， okay， or I think she's off for more。

 Whatever she says， cool， hey， bring her， Really？ Yeah， be fun on me， your friends， Okay， cool。

 Right？ Do you have any others？ Yeah， why？， Because hey， I'm a friendly social guy， That'd be cool。

 And then I ruthlessly flirt with all of them， the second they show up， Dude。

 you wonder the best time to pick up a chick is like， minutes after you fuck one， Like， oh my god。

 Oh yeah， it's true， like， there's probably some scientific shit too。

 When you guys fucking nerds know about Monadio， Seriously， it's called the stinky leg， Stinky leg。

 you fuck one， you fuck one， you fuck one， shake with the condom， And then you just pull it out。

 you fuck the other， you do the stinky leg， So， anyway， I'm like， talk to point out。

 I'll keep making these jokes more heinous until one person's laughing， And then I know I won。

 So then you thought you'd like， set the thing straight and really see where she stands？， Yeah。

 Got it， yeah， no， No， no， so hand holding， first of all， like。

 the hand holding thing is not a good thing， Right， hand holding is kind of like。

 switch hand hold to arm and arm， Done， like， I'm just double your game， So， seriously， arm and arm。

 arm and arm through anywhere， because you could fuck the girl who you're arm and arm with。

 But you're also still being the protector， but it's not the hands。

 so it's not as pervy and fucking romantic and shit， Right， if you're gonna do the hands。

 do like the fucking dangling pinky， Right， I like to punish girls。

 these are different ways that are classically conditioned girls， And so， like。

 I'll do the three finger one， right， when I respect her when things are going well， And then。

 if like， she pissed me off， like， I'll let some time pass， then I'll hold the pinky instead。

 When you do that， I mean， it sounds so horrible， When you do the behavior correction like that。

 you can just， like， the relationship ends up actually going really， really well， It's kind of funny。

 Yeah， Back to your thing， right， because I think I， like， there's lots of happy people who are like。

 I'm here for personal development， You're a， you're a nipple thing， right？ You're。

 you're nipple deal， So， what you got to do is you got to do the nipple one， right？ You're holy shit。

 So， what's she gonna say？， What？， I never noticed how big your fucking nipples were， And then。

 what's she gonna say？， What？， It's like a， it's like 51% negative， right？， It's like， wait， what？

 It's not that negative， but she's like， what？ And I go， no， no， I love it， it's great， Right。

 she's back and forth， Right， just， bam， bam， back and forth， right？， No， it's great， I love it。

 I love the big nipples， it's amazing， So awesome， and then like。

 she's like literally just let her sit in that and watch her just be like， what？， The fuck？， Right？。

 Talk about a pattern in her up， right？， So， you're onto the next thing， This is not the table thing。

 this is super simple， Literally， make a nipple joke， You know what？ I'm setting up like this。

 because I， like I said， I like to do the whole， like， friend fucking thing， But like， if I were you。

 like， I'm telling you， the nipple thing， don't even make it as complex as I'm making it。

 I'm obviously， I've done this a lot of many times， so I'm setting this whole thing up with the。

 holy fuck， She's like， what？， You fucking nipple， or like， if I really want to go crazy。

 I'll be like， you're ariolas， dude， Awesome， What does it even mean？

 Like say stuff that you don't know what it means， and it's gonna work well with a girl， Holy shit。

 What？ You're ariolas， Like， that's the， you know how I get these， uh， double make-outs， like。

 with these girls， I do this through a make-outs， Like， my， my start to all my three-some game is。

 you know she's got a really cute ariola， You say she got a cute nipple， you got a good boob。

 a good whatever， all of a sudden the girls are like，， Ooh， you're a pervert。

 but ariola is such a weird word that they're like， wait， does she？， Yeah。

 but it's a really cute ariola， And then she's like， oh， let me see， okay， and then like。

 it's now like a， like a scientific expedite， Like， it's now， like， medically。

 when you see her ariola now， Yeah， I say， oh， but it， and then she's like。

 starts rubbing her ariola， but her covering the nipple， Like， yeah， yeah， cover the nipple。

 I don't need to see that shit， but that's fucking shit away。

 I don't need to see your dirty ass fucking nipple， Oh， really don't want to see it。

 and what did you say， you tell， that's why I think the record is stupid。

 Because you tell the girl to do something， and what does she immediately want to do？， The opposite。

 So let's play along， That's what you want to make you happy， I'll do it， like， I don't give a shit。

 right？， So literally， the girl's nipples out， right？， So I'm like， no， put it away， and she's like。

 I don't， I don't need to see that fucking dirty ass shit， I don't need to see that right now。

 I'm a godfiring man， Don't laugh that hard， So anyway， at the point is I'm like。

 I'm gonna put the fucking nipple away， So she's like， no， and then she's like， moving the nipple。

 she's like， ah， nipple， nipple， In fact， I can actually like， do that now， it's creepy， Nipple。

 right？， So then she's like， so I go， oh， you know the ariola， it feels good， right？。

 And the girl's like， yeah， it feels good， because all the ariola's feel great， And I go， oh。

 it's funny though， it's， your fingers too coarse， That's why。

 Do you guys notice I put a lot of these like verbal ellipsis's， ellipsis， right？， Yeah， Okay。

 what does that do？， It causes them to what？， Chase， Chase， and participate back in the conversation。

 you want buy-in into the conversation， It's like forced investment？， Exactly， forced investment。

 investment is attraction， I use value to get it， this should be like， right up your alley， Jared。

 right？， Yeah， Good， good， good， you're better off the most people in。

 You're better off than like 90% of the typical audience that go for it。

 I'm gonna come back to your thing as well， right？， Because I want to。

 there's like three more things you have to say to actually close the deal。

 But the nipple thing is a good start， Hopefully that's not the same moment。

 I'm gonna go for it from you， I'm creating that dynamic， You understand。

 like a lot of these things that I'm telling you guys to do that guys are like， But what about this？

 I'm like， no， I hope that fucking twisted situation happens， But you also got to stand。

 I'm not like， I'm also flirting with my， you know。

 45-year-old Hispanic valetendent at my apartment building， Right？。

 Like after I pull out from the girl within 30 minutes， you know， like we hop up。

 we go to the brunch or whatever， I'm waiting for my car from the valet person。

 Like she's 45 years old， 50-year-old， like old Hispanic chick or Filipino， So I'm like， oh。

 Kamustika， I'm a gondaka， I'm a helketah， Right， let me speak to that guy again here， I'm just like。

 I love you， all your sexy as fuck， Let me speak Portuguese， I'm like， oh。

 I'll go see if you pop a sata， I'm going to go to a gora， I mean。

 I want to suck a lot of your pussy right now， Like whatever race that she is， like， I'm， you know。

 Pia， young， go fall， Like I'm just like saying， like， these like， flirts and all these different。

 you know， I mean， obviously the race that she is， But the point is。

 whatever girl that comes up between me pulling out of her and then us actually eating the brunch。

 Right？， I'm flirting with at least， what， 10 girls in between there and， you know， the。

 where I am in the brunch， We walk in the hostesses there， oh you again。

 when are you going to fucking run away with me？， What？。

 When are you going to run away with me and make a fucking honest man out of me？， This is crazy。

 like， and the girl I just fucked is right here， She looks at me for half a second and goes， what？。

 And then I go， hold on a second， seriously， you never called me again， what the fuck？。

 And I look at the girl， I'm like， I look at the girl that I'm， you know， I just fucked。

 And I'm like， this， this， this fucking， you got to watch out for this one， Dude， seriously。

 she'll fuck you， she won't call you， And the whole time they're just like， what？。

 But I've clearly done this plenty of times with the one， with the girl， right？， With the， I mean。

 girl， with the hostess or whatever， The whole point is I'm trying to create that atmosphere， Right？

 If you wait， create that atmosphere， you're fucked， Right？ I have a very specific， I mean。

 it's a good， it's a good， it's crazy， I have a， anybody who a taz angel is？。

 I think I talk about the free tour， I mean， taz angel is， and the young guy now， Like。

 my whole thing， I'm like， building this taz angel setup， And like。

 in order for a girl to climb in the ranks of the taz angel setup。

 She needs to fuck the other girl that's in it， Right？ So， like， there's no， like。

 having that mentality， you can't， you know， on October 7th and 8th。

 Is really when I'm gonna turn the screws on this taz angel thing， But anyway， I mean。

 that's a separate thing， The point is that I'm trying to create this crazy setup。

 I'm trying to create this sexual thing back and forth， I'm trying to， like， if anything， I'm like。

 like， the girl's mad， I go， what？， What？ At least tell her she's got a good butt， like， look at it。

 I mean， I know it doesn't look good in this outfit， but she's got a sexy ass， Right？ So。

 I'm trying to create this whole thing， If you set up ahead of time， you're golden。

 If you wait a day or two， now you're this creepy pervert， Do you understand？ It's like three cents。

 Anybody been married before， if they have a fiance， anybody？， Anybody have a long-term relationship。

 whatever， right？， Imagine， like， several months in that relationship， you're just like， hey。

 I kinda want to fuck your best friend Stacey， She fucking hits you， she， like， what。

 especially the kind of girls that I date， Filipinos and Puerto Ricans and Brazilians， Oh。

 go fuck yourself， right？， I'm about to back back with the， she's like， fuck it。

 start fucking screaming at me， You know， like， no， he doesn't work that way。

 But within minutes of you kissing her， within minutes of you pulling out of her， If you keep。

 if you just show that's exactly who you are， she can take it or leave it。

 But in a very friendly way， she's gonna take it at 100% of the time， Right？

 To the point where I would actually， I mean， even on my same night lays。

 I'll get them to escalate on each other， Why？ Because when I'm in the social circle， right。

 you're really the quickest way to burn your social circle， Let's go beast mode。

 other people's social circles， If you win， great， but like， if you don't， you just fuck yourself。

 So when you're getting them to escalate on each other。

 and then you pull back to the point where you're like， oh man， stop， Put it away， Stop， I mean。

 a little more， come， turn， Stop， stop doing that， Right？ But they're escalating on each other。

 I get all the benefit of the sexual escalation without me being the one who's doing the physicality。

 And there's no validation sent from my way to her， Do you understand？

 So I get to save all that validation points when it's time to actually pull， Do you understand？

 I mean， it's super beautiful， When I first learned that， I was like， fuck。

 I'm never touching girls again， This is amazing， Here's the thing， like， there's， okay。

 it's the kind of like provider and lover， right？， Just because a girl sees you as a provider。

 does not mean that she doesn't see as lover， So just because she looks at him as like a relationship guy。

 which she clearly at minimum looks at him as a guy that， you know， she wants to date at some level。

 right？， That doesn't mean that she doesn't see him as a sexual guy either， Yeah。

 so the technique though， because that's a little more， you're looking for her as condescension。

 right？， You'll be super condescending to her， So every time she even gets a little bit flirty with you。

 be like， no！， I told you again！， It's not gonna happen， But like， super condescending to her， like。

 you say it， but then you look around and you just like， smirk to your left and your right。

 You're like， no！， I told you， it's not gonna fucking happen， Right？ Does that make sense？， Yeah。

 Because that way you're like， you're tooling her， that's where the condescension is。

 because you're looking like， left and right， And then she starts talking， be like， shut up！ I said！。

 No！ Not today！ Right？， And she's gonna be like that， just for like a child， like super big child。

 And now suddenly she's not gonna stop you， I do， use life， I just fuck them。

 and then it's not a problem， Because if you fuck them， now suddenly you're not the relationship guy。

 Every day that you see them， and you don't fuck them， they're like， oh。

 well he now can't fuck Stacey Sarah Jackie， Right？ Because now， like， that's my guy that I'm like。

 like， that she is like on the burner or something， No， no， he did the right thing。

 and he should have fucking told her to the butt the nipple thing， He should have。

 he should have did my nipple trick， Right？ He should not have fought， Like。

 you never wanna find out where a girl stands， Because she's never gonna be standing where you want her to stand。

 Ever， Like， even if she likes you， I've done that in the past where I'm just like， so， um。

 I just wanna like figure what's happening here， What's going like， do you tune me like， many lays。

 like， well over 50 before I stopped in a stupid shit like that， I mean， my first few abortions， or。

 um， was， no， no， My first few abortions， I was like， I had to end up， uh， I， uh， for some reason。

 like， you get really attached， You get， like， your lay counts less than 20， and like， like。

 you knock two girls up， Like， all of a sudden， they， like， and they tell you。

 the first thing to come out of your mouth is， will you be my girlfriend？， What？ No。

 that's the last thing I should do， it's like， no， I should find this fucking staircase， There's a。

 no， nobody's talking， Joaquin， tock point out， remember tock point out， Okay？， There you go。

 There you go， exactly。
