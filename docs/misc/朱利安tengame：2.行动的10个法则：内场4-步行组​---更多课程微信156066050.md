可， mein，你，但是，我知道，晒，晒，晒，晒，你，玉妹，根本，相像，不過，正好，我，虍，要我們，在， make，建議，成功，Don't don't don't。

It's better to immediately just start walking with them，Ok，and make it casual like you're just。

Oh so anyway how's it going？， is you're walking with her， if the girl is kinda like。

 you're probably like，Hey stop， and she'll stop，However understand too that。

if she is going somewhere，ok get the logistics like where you going。

realize that even though she stops， she'll probably just stop for two three minutes。

she's still at some point， and wanna keep going， to point B。

 in which case you're gonna have to go with her，Yeah，So which way is it better to stop her。

in the front or in the back，Does it matter？，It's，But probably yeah it's like tap tap。

Yeah a lot of my opens are tap tap，She's walking like tap tap excuse me， or just like walk with。

 Again your only goal is like， it really doesn't matter if you stop her or not。

 your only goal is like keep the interaction going，Whatever will keep the interaction going。

 That's it，Ok are you from Miami？，Are you from Miami？，Are you from Miami？，No， no，Where are you from？。

Russia，Are you really from Serbia？，Wait one second one second，Bang。

So I'm like telling you what I'm like，Tell them are you from Miami？。

Like these two girls are walking by，And then they keep walking。

And they're like wait are you from this？，This？ This？，This？，It's like check it out， check it out。

 check it out，Slowly reeling them in，I just got，No no no no no no one second fuck，And then I walk up。

You don't have time，You don't have time what does that even mean？。

It's like it doesn't have to make logical sense，It just starts spitting shit。

It's like the words don't matter，You just want to communicate，As effectively and as fast as possible。

The type of guy you are through the vibe，That's it， that's what reaching that hook point is。

The words don't worry about，It's better if you just mumble shit。

So she gets to experience you than say nothing，Big on the open，Hey stop what does that mean？。

Miami's sugar what fish？，Hey，She'll like that，That is better than，Hey。

Are in running out of shit to say，Fucking machine gun that shit，By the way，Living the now，By the way。

Pshglasses，Living the now，Something I find funny，Real her in，Nice to meet you。

Are you really from Serbia？，Yeah，Moscow，You don't live here， huh？，Yeah。

Why would you not live in this society？，No， it's not，I don't probably need to do a story I think。

It's my sister，MySabaka，Sabaka，I know， mySabaka，Yeah， in the back，Wait， what was your name？。

Sabaka's dog， I know，Are you from New York？，I'm from New York，Try a town，25th social，I am from there。

Come back，Come back， come back，Offer， check this out， check this out，And then you still have to。

Like notice a little common theme between these，You still have to be like，Come back，Like Teller。

Because otherwise you take that， responsibly offer of it for her，And say to me like，Hey， try a town。

Come back， come back， come back，Come back， I'll tell you if you come back。

I live right next to the 25th social，I live in Wastlow，Really，My friend is in here。

I think I go coast，So this is good， boom， it starts walking with her，Senska， really？，Yukteborg。

Try to stop her，She does actually，But you can sense， eventually she probably。

She's not going to stay here，It's kind of like，It's better to just walk with。

Do you live in Miami or no？，Yeah，Do you are from Sweden？，Yeah，Really， my friend is from Alaska。

In today， ice cream，In today， ice cream，Bang，I remember you，LittleDub，LittleDub。

You were never a beautiful，LittleDub，You were never，You were never，You were good，Just honey baby。

It's like， boom，Girls walking with her friend，Walk by，So you're from Miami by the way？。

Is it really you from Miami by the way？，Are you from Miami or France？。

Just shake my hand and then I have to go，For you from Brazil，No，Sauvallo，Where？，Where？，Me too。

 France，Now once again， when you're walking，You got to give it time for her to like。

One realize she's been opened，And get drawn in，She doesn't know that I'm cool yet，Okay？。

And it's also important to understand with like walking sets，Let them know why you're stopping them。

Either in the vibe， if you want to amplify it，Like shake her hand。

Because Lagos is like who the fucks this guy？，What does he want？，Oh he wants to meet me，Cool。

Let her know why you're there，For just like， mum， you know， rambling shit。

So you're like shake my hand，Oh where you from， France？，Me too，Romeo or Milan？，Nice to meet you。

 so are you telling to？，No， that's Asia，Where？，No， where you from？，Just two minutes， stop， stop。

 just two minutes，I just got here yesterday，You guys live here or no？，No。

 I don't fucking want something，Also every time like two minutes stop，I keep it talking。

Two minutes stop，Silence，What do you mean by， you realize why she's you're opening her？，Okay。

Most girls， like guys get rejected when they stop walking sets。

Cuz they think the guy's homeless or trying to solicit her for something，It's like what does he want？

，It's like if you're walking down the street and someone stops you，Our defaults like，Keep a walk it。

Unless you guys stop and talk to everyone who stops you，Why？ Because most guys who stop you。

It's like， do you want to sign this？，Oh do you have money？，I'm here， I'm opening you to meet you。

Not to sell you on something， not to ask you for money to meet you。

And the handshake kind of helps consolidate that too，I don't want something。

 I'm not like some little restaurant guy，Oh，That's why even her， she's like， what do you want？。

I don't want something with the fuck girl，Okay， you're a restaurant guy，No，I'm visiting。

 I just got here yesterday，Okay，So I just wondering， you live here or no？，We are from vacation，Yeah。

But long vacation，We have some people from the long vacation，But you're not from Rome right？，No，Good。

 because that was the only place I've been in Italy and everyone was too short，I'm not in the middle。

Where is she from？，Russia，Oh， I'm from Kiev，Oh， nice to meet you，I'm not，But I know a little bit。

Swiss， originally，Junev，So the French part，Are you a French person？。

But I have a perfect American accent，By the way，Usually I'm like George Bush，Keep is not Russia。

I know it's you couldn't，But I'm just too American，I'm really not that smart，Okay， I'm not right。

What are you guys doing right now？，We're coming home，Did you ever go to that bar？，No。

Someone said it's up there or something，No，It's not like a building，You don't know if it's good then。

What do you recommend for an after work bar on this street？，So sketch，No。

 that building there is there's a bar I think it there？，If you're old enough，She's not。

How old are you？，Really，Really？，18，18，Are you？，No，Little bit older，I just turned 18，It's my birthday。

I should have been your birthday，Why you fucking，Why you never believe me，I'm serious，I'm 18。

And look slowly they start，BOOM reacting，Reeling in，Especially this one。

I kind of do like that inside joke，I'm 18，It's like no he's not，Why are you doing this？，Target。

But plowing through，Once again it's not this way，You doing something different，Or more。

It's just pretty much， Endurance，And like stay through that awkward phase，Because even in this open。

There's a little awkward phase，Where we stop，And it's like，So。

You know and they're giving you nothing，And they will block it off at times too，To see how you react。

It's like what if I block it off and give nothing，Does he squirm？，Does he freak out？。

Does he need something from me？，Is he trying to take something from me？，And if you're truly not。

Then you won't mind it，If you're trying to take then you will squirm and freak out。

So they will do that，Just keep fucking making yourself feel good， Law 3，You can be under the meat。

I am 18，I don't have it on me，I forgot my wallet，Yeah I forgot my wallet，It's a big fat flat。

Hey look look I can do it，It's true，My birthday is not today，But it was yesterday，I'm 18。

The guy at our hotel，It's like， you should go there，Really？，Delina，Yeah，It's cool，Or SLS。

Why I want you to have SLS，It's hard to get into，We're not cool，He's like why？，I'm like，He didn't。。。。

I'm trying，I'm trying，You almost killed me，What is her name？，Okay，So some examples of walking sets。

You can stop them， you can walk with them，Just be aware，And again。

 your goal is not to keep them where you open them，Get in the habit of walking with。

If you're only trying to stop， you're missing out a lot of opportunity。

And remember to the concept of plowing，Just keep expressing who you are， keep the check this out。

So at one point，There will be enough data for her to get drawn in。

And your goal is to inspire her to get drawn in，Not to pull her in。
