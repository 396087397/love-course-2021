# 朱利安ten game：8.训练营简报：训练营汇报1

錄音 System 不 working on the，移開這 quality MC，循環級塵骨，而且受我認為，人用隔壁，她說，我不要再構思！，她喜歡氣死心，ついす letters，負職什麼都沒有。

不定調供，不管是誰，香到飯，要是混顱，駕種，是最強烈的，OK，嗯，但是， kind of coming from that frame of mind， it's key key key， ok。

 so， remember we'll be talked about during the night out， post， bootcamp， do a couple nights out。

 where it's like no polls， no numbers， and， and， a lot of the two is kind of， disconnecting， because。

 you probably heard like social conditioning， you know， social conditioning in a way。

 it's like there's a lot of， bad things， there's a lot of good stuff， a lot of bad stuff。

 that you're traditional， and， the same with if you will， even pick up the conditioning， where。

 you snap out of social conditioning， you recondition yourself with pickup。

 but then there's also some bad things， that guys buy into， and， one is basically。

 doing it safe for the validation， and doing it for the result， and， basically becoming the ultimate。

 people pleaser， if you will， you know， it's like that's， why most guys are in this。

 it's like they don't even want the girl， they don't even want to grow at the end of the night。

 they just want to， ever go to the like them， they just never want to， fail an interaction。

 or fuck up a sex， that's their whole fucking goal， it's like they'd rather。

 have every girl just like them， versus get a girl， without even see， it's like it's not even sex。

 it's not even getting a girlfriend or anything， just like， everyone just loves me， and I look cool。

 that's like， the best night out， ever， which is， again massive people pleaser， so a big one。

 and this will take a lot of， pressure off too， and funny enough， it will， generate more， results。

 is， really hammering at home， that you don't have to succeed， with every girl， you don't have to。

 you're not supposed to， and realistically you can't， and this is pretty key， it's like。

 everyone has that need， like when you talk to a girl， you want to end on， like a high note。

 or you want to end with that feeling of， well， and that's what most guys would do。

 it's like even with that girl， it depends， again sometimes， I'll like， pursue the girl。

 flip it around， sometimes like， but a lot of guys， would have that inkling of， well at least。

 even though I don't want， fuck her， at least she should go say， hi make her smile。

 and then come back， so I did well， if a girl， says a boyfriend， and you know。

 you're not gonna fuck her， you're not just gonna， leave immediately， or you can like， chat a bit。

 like make her laugh， and then leave， so I'm going to do well， if you talk to a girl。

 and a friend comes in， and friend， and you can't flip it around， you're just going to keep。

 trying to do it， when in reality， it's like， you're not supposed， like everybody。

 and I are supposed to， like you， and you can't， and once you come to terms， of that。

 so much pressure is gone， you know， is that whole idea of， getting any girl， anytime， any way。

 any day， is a myth， it's like， there's just some girls， not men to be with。

 and there are some girls， too that you're just not， gonna fucking like。

 you know on a personal level， here you may be like， oh my gosh， it's hot。

 but if you actually get to， know her， and looks， like you'll realize， like with time， she's like。

 it's not enough at all， it's like， it's just a small portion， so， a couple things there， is like。

 don't be afraid of just， bouncing out， you don't have to， leave with a little， I did well。

 like you can just， let it go， and you can be like， hey， whatever， it's totally fine， as long as。

 obviously you're not using， this excuse， okay， because then you'll be like， oh fuck it。

 with every girl， it's like， still play to win， whatever， totally fine， and， it doesn't。

 you shouldn't feel， any dip in terms of， how you feel， it's like， oh I got， like a rejected。

 or a fucked up， at all， it's like your night just， keeps on going， another way of viewing it。

 and I believe I talk about this， and him， is not as separate， sets， but basically the whole night。

 is one big set， okay， and this also kind of， links into， where you said， where even in between， set。

 you know， between set， is equally as important， as what you do， and it's like， you need something。

 you turn on， when you're talking to girls， it's the whole night， of big interaction， at the end。

 something happens， where it doesn't， it's a hell of an experience， you know， another way。

 just kind of building， on this， under the plenty of these， different seats， is the way you should。

 view and open， building on the fact， that say it looks， isn't enough， is you're。

 initially attracted， by the girl， but you're going up， and you're going to， be a lot of fun。

 where you're not， fully sold yet on the， girl， you're not sure yet， if you're going to， like her。

 hate each other， so it's not just coming， from that， full-on， separating， please like me。

 because you don't， know her， there's the initial， interest， but you're like， okay let's find out。

 more about this person， and then also switching it， it's not you going up， and trying to make it。

 work with all these， girls， it's you putting， yourself out， there with all these， girls。

 you're like， the ultimate way， and even if， say you talk to， 20 girls， and there's like， 18 or 19。

 that don't like， you only one or two， that just love you， that's a way， better， success than having。

 like 19 girls， like you， and one rejection， it's like， it's a way， that's you want， those girls。

 love， love， love you， we just really， get along， now again， that too， don't use， an excuse。

 is guess what， it's like you can， the better， yourself， and where you work， on yourself。

 the more relatable， you're going to be， and you know， the more chemistry， you'll have people。

 and you also have to， work to make it， relatable， but sometimes there's， some girls who say， yeah。

 whatever， it's really a， personal call， like， some girls， I'll talk to， and they're， giving me shit。

 and I'll just kind of， plow through， this challenge， some other girls， is like， yeah。

 so it's kind of， that's why I told you guys， every time， between interactions， it's like。

 your only correct， if you're doing well， is are you having， more fun than before， are you more care。

 free than before， are you more engaged， than before， that's how you should， determine how well。

 you're doing， throughout the night， it's not， did the girl， like me， or did I do this， move well。

 or did I get a， number of validation， is how do I feel， now， it's important， because that's。

 basically what we're， doing， we're like a girl， we're just pumping our， energy。

 so that the end of the， night when everyone's， ready it's like， you're， feeling the best， ever。

 that's the first part， of the night， of course you get some， leads some numbers， but it's you。

 getting yourself into， that， sex worthy state， and much of this， a lot to you， but it applies to。

 everyone's like， if the girl is not， saying， into the conversation， don't look at the， content。

 but look at it as I said， the way you deliver， that content， and a good， you know， the， the。

 Joe Rogan， podcast， you guys ever， listen to that？， you do？， hey， basically， he has like。

 this podcast， you can check it out， people love it， yeah， he's， I went to， close to， really， yeah。

 he's like， it's really， interesting to listen to， but what I was joking， guys， although there's。

 some good， points， a lot of those， podcasts too， is just him， just， having， the other， guest。

 he's not， talking about， pretty much， talking about， nothing but， people love it， just his。

 of the way it makes， him feel， even some of the， ideas he discusses， it's not necessarily， some new。

 shit， but people like it， because he's the， one， who's saying， it， even if you， have been watching。

 a lot of my videos， you get a，始終係頭嗦。，普 Arthur的跟我說，他真讚得出來，就是美女的很好，他跟網友說，專業它是我們的美女，我經常想不想讓我一直講。

官方自公化了 一切感受莫非，你不是 trying to make it work with every girl。

 It will help just get rid of all the filters， And you won't have to worry about say push pull and all that。

 Because it will naturally happen， You're gonna have naturally have these like playful disagreements。

 Dumb it down when you're out， You know， it's like you're still like kind of like。

 Smart intellectual thinking， It's like dumb little kid， You know， it's like it's a mix obviously。

 But I want you to kind of amp up the dumb little kid side of this。

 Because even it's like foam logistics， Like okay logistics for the drug memorizing mission。

 I'm on a mission basically， It's like no mission， And funny enough this is how。

 This is the subtlety behind it， It's like your on a mission。

 But your mission is to basically not have a mission， That's how you win the game， If you want。

 You talked about this too， And we'll get to your breakdown， Where it's like， You know。

 in most things in life， As you said， it's like you have to like viciously pursue， You know。

 it's like go all out， You want a job or you go all out， But with this one。

 The way you viciously pursue it， Is by letting it go and allowing it to happen if you will。

 Which is a lot harder to do funny enough， You know， it's like you have to like， oh look。

 You're still pursuing it， Then you gotta somehow trick yourself， It's not pursuing it。

 Because that's the way you get it， It's a student， Yeah， It's like chasing fish away。

 Or it's like kind of letting them， It's like a tight sheet， That's it， yeah。

 What buns to push to make yourself laugh， So those are some。

 But I want you to start thinking and exploring， That even further death。

 What are other things that I find fun， What are the patterns behind my people。

 And this is something you can do like the sticking points， Where say you write down three things。

 You said it and you found funny， You take a month， period of time， You have a fuck ton of them。

 And then you just kind of categorize them， By themes if you will。

 And now you see which buns to push， You know， when I go out。

 Why do I get into these own pretty fasts， Or why can I maintain my fun throughout the night。

 A lot easier than say you， Because I have state crashes too， Emotions always come in waves。

 But I know which buns to push to give me there， It's because I did this。

 I know exactly in which way I could say something。

 Or if something happens in which way I could just use it， To push one of those buns inside。

 And this is unique to you， People have different types of humor。

 So this is one level you want to write it all down， Under another you want to kind of look through。

 Say you're life， And like at the sheet you found funny when you were a kid。

 You know what's kind of like those unique traits， Um， me and if you're not that familiar。

 It's like look up some like comedy， Start looking at maybe some stand up。

 It's like just learn how to like really really laugh， You know。

 And not just like a smile like full on like this is the funniest shit， And uh。

 yeah this is something I had to work on， Massively because I couldn't like even growing up。

 Like I trouble trouble to laugh， Uh， even at like movies and shit。

 It's like everyone to watch like friends， Everyone be like crack and happen on to like。

 I was kind of like too logical like analyzing the shit， Versus kind of letting it just fuck around。

 Even at like a even now it's so occasionally I trouble if I go like a comedy show。

 I'm more so like it would， I'm first just laughing and joining， So it's kind of like resumming that。

 You just want to make yourself feeling engaged， The girl doesn't care what the joke is or the content of the humor。

 She wants to feel how same that makes you feel， So for me right now it's like。

 I love for example making fun of， Different stereotypes。

 I give a girl some Germany I'm gonna bring up say sour crowd。

 So I go you like sour crowd love love love love love， Like that if the girls from say， Mexico。

 I'll be like oh you know， The floor is pretty dirty， You really feel like cleaning right now。

 We have that urge to clean like just like this kind of like dickish， Seriotype mocking humor。

 That's me I find that fun， Another one is kind of， Making things a little awkward。

 Kind of like a poor at like sense of humor， Where I'm saying shit with a full on straight face。

 But I'm like， Like I'm like holding the laughter back。

 What is she feeling that build up a laughter and fun， Okay， And then ultimately it's like。

 Just kind of like saying shit where it's like， You don't know if I'm serious or not。

 Like if the girls like， Oh， I'm like are you an intro and my last night are you an intern。

 She's like yeah I'm like oh me too， You know I turned 21 last week， And they're also good like。

 Because of the goal it's like， It's like that little thing in my mind。

 And then it's like that's what she feels， So those are just some that are unique to me。

 What's unique to you？， Okay， And this here it's like， The it's not so much like the content of like。

 Oh I just turned 21， It's like that emotion that button， I can use it with whatever happens。

 You know it's like the girl says something now， I'm like oh how can I use it to。

 Create something a little bit awkward that I find funny， And now if you take my focus。

 It's not even on the girl， It's on the process and what I'm saying。

 And that too is also a key to let go of the outcome， And that's what I'm doing is by self-emusing。

 And you're so self-emusing focused on your actions， You don't have time to even notice any outcome。

 Because if you ask yourself， When I touch the outcome， You're touching the outcome。

 So those are some like general stuff to keep in mind， In terms of the more practical side。

 Exaggerate your range of expression， Just tonight dude， When you laugh， Exaggerate it。

 I want like instead of a smile， I want an extreme like laugh jumping up and down， Okay。

 Keep yourself in motion， More to that's like the biggest biggest secrets to this， Always in motion。

 Throughout the night， Even if it's just tapping your foot， Bopping your head。

 As I told you in the last night， Even though I'm standing still。

 And sometimes just watching you guys， I'm still keeping the shit going， Okay。

 it's like I'm still in my group if you will， I'm not fully static， The static key really is dead。

 In between sets too， Don't forget to ask yourself， What's the next thing to do。

 Don't give yourself the time， To start analyzing the interaction。

 While you're out in between interactions， It's like what happened there。

 It's like kill that logical side， Bring out like the kid， Fun kid， So when you're out。

 It's like what's the next thing to do， You can open a new set， You can come up to me。

 You can come up to each other， Fuck around with each other too， Ain't fuck around with me。

 It's like we should build that fun type of pie， You know， when you leave a set。

 High five each other， Okay， when you come up to me， High five me with a huge smile， If you don't。

 Go back and do it with a high five， It's kind of like， It's like you're always that person。

 Not just when there's the girl， And that'll help a lot too， Yeah， so like what I would say。

 Act as if there's a 10 next few albums， And so there's that， Still do the logistics。

 They end the phone number， And condition yourself to do that， Like every interaction， Right。

 Ideally do it， Not super soon in， But before it ends， Just ask for the number。

 And ideally to you want to do it， Before she's walking away。

 And that there's something you have to sense， It's like you'll sense it kind of， Slowly dine down。

 Or sometimes you'll sense like， You grow a little bit， Say losing it。

 And sometimes it's because you did something bad， But other times it's like。

 It's just the way it goes， It's too early in the night， Even later in the night too。

 And this is pretty key， Good to you bounce the scrolls outside， Those long interactions。

 45 minutes an hour and a half， Very rarely do you have them in one， Little environments。

 It's too boring， I just do fucking boring， So it's like you will have to move them around， Live。

 So yeah， I mean still logistics， And then some other big ones for you is， Yeah way more fun。

 In the beginning like really try to fuck around， With girls， It's like more ridiculous。

 And don't be afraid of， Sometimes just fucking it up， As long as it's not too far out there。

 It'd be afraid， Fuck around with unattractive girls as well， Okay。

 And like learn how to have genuine fun with them， Another thing you'll also get。

 You know people don't want to talk to ugly girls， But funny enough the ugly girls are the ones with the best verbal game。

 That's why I get all my verbal game problems， Funny enough。

 Because the whole one's not up to development， So kind of fuck around there， And more emerging。

 Okay， When you're talking to a girl you should always be thinking， How can I have more fun。

 More fun， And involve more girls， More girls， So introduce her around。

 Bring her introduce her to everyone， It's like no one has a target in the beginning。

 It doesn't matter， Okay， So I want us to work on that， Tonight too。

 I mean I want everyone to start thinking a little bit more in terms of。

 Dealing with the logistics and pulling， And I'll probably do a little time out。

 And I'll pull you all to the side， And kind of quiz you on that， In terms of like say。

 How to bounce her once you have the logistics， What if she says this， What if this happens。

 Start kind of thinking like that， And with the physicality that would be the last point。

 As I said it's like never just rush in， It's like the tap tap， I usually do it。

 It's like you can get a feel for wherever， Fine temperature is at， And then choose an important。

 An appropriate course， And always handshake from the start。

 And getting the habit to meaning in and meaning back， Back back back， And it can be tough。

 But like the girls needs， To lean in and start chasing， But otherwise the little ransom， Otherwise。

 First of all that， That one amazing， Remember the feeling， And then interaction。

 And this is something， Say in the intro video， It's like during the boot camp， It's like say。

 This is no game， This is game， You'll see it， You'll see it in me， You'll have little flashes。

 Experiencing it， Not necessarily consistently， It usually takes three to six months， To internalize。

 Everything we're talking about here， But you'll have those little experiences。

 So you know what it emotionally feels like， And then what it's feedback to get there。

 But do whatever it can， To even write down like notes， keywords to remember， What that feeling。

 Is after you have to kind of like aim towards， And secondly， When she says that。

 Hey I have to go find my friends， Nothing bad about it， She has to， You can try the hey， You know。

 They'll text you etc， And I'd probably try that， But as soon as I sense that。

 She's still really concerned about the friends， I'll help you find them， Exactly， It's a mission。

 It's a mission together， We're going to find them， Are they under the table？， Yeah。

 Then you get this like walk around with her， And help her find them， It's from her perspective。

 And this is a lot of say social， You know， intelligence， It's like， You always have to ask yourself。

 What's the girls' school， On a macro level， But on a micro level， This is why on a macro level。

 I'm telling you guys， Like don't expect things to last， You know， long， In terms of interactions。

 And the first part of the night， Because no girls' goal， That she goes out。

 Is to have a long serious conversation， And it's like she wants to have an abundance of fun。

 And if you go against that， And you're going in with your boring conversation。

 It's not going to mesh， So that's on a macro level， On a micro level too， It's like if she's here。

 And her goal is to find her friends， And suddenly， You're putting yourself in the way。

 Of her accomplishing your goal， You're now the obstacle， And it's just not going to mesh。

 Even though you're cool， The same thing with walking sets， And I told you guys， It's like。

 You can try to stop them， But if you sense， They're still going to keep walking。

 Or they stop for a minute， But they still have to go wherever they're going， Go with them。

 Don't ever place yourself as an obstacle to their goal， Ideally， it's find a way to make goals。

 mesh， Yeah， you notice how， It's like， You try to eject。

 And have your mind is looking for everything， So you're just like， she pulls out her phone， Like。

 Yeah， So， So yeah， it's like these， I mean， I think that's a really good one。

 Just in terms of plowing through， Try to do it more， It's like， Staying longer。

 And another thing you can do， In terms of like say a little technique， Or say moving forward。

 Is realize that that bouncing out， Really is a conscious habit， And kind of like a success barrier。

 A way of self-solving， It's like， It's like， It's like you're doing what you're comfortable doing。

 It's like open and chatting， And something you're reaching like， Okay， this is kind of new。

 Just just me， Because even if it goes well， It's like you've never ventured there。

 It's like that unknown to you to see jazz， So you kind of want to， Decentize yourself。

 Like build the muscle just stay in the longer， And I would need you to correct that habit。

 Is to just switch it with another habit， So every time you have that urge of say， Leaving， Instead。

 maybe move her around a little bit， Just switch the habit， Okay， And that too， So like if you're。

 Just moving her around， assuming she moves， Just even a few feet over。

 It kind of revitalizes the interaction， Because it's a new environment， So you could literally。

 Retalk about the same thing in a new setting， Just be more so than before。

 So I'd say switch the habit and then， Focus on building that muscle。

 Whenever you get that feeling like， I should eject， You just like just extra reps。

 It's like staying there， Staying there， Staying there， Staying there， Staying。

 Really learning how to verbalize， What you're thinking or your thoughts， Or what you're feeling。

 You know， it's like， This was a， There was a， Who came student in Atlanta。

 That was his biggest thing in the way， It's like， You have all these things to say。

 And it's like you ran out things to say， And I'm like， Just。

 Like there's always something on your mind， There's always like that little voice in your head。

 There's always something on your mind， And what we tend to do is， We judge them。

 And then we're very aware of， Like， okay， well， people think， If I say this， Send a reality。

 it's like getting rid of it， And just putting it all out there， And once you kind of master that。

 You'll never run out of things to say， This is why when you feel entitled。

 You're not so much worried about， What people are going to think of， Where you're going to set。

 So you allow yourself to let it all flow out， It's like grad， classic， I think he ought to。

 And what he says is， His view of things， A lot of， let's just say unhappiness。

 Or internal disruption， if you will， Comes from line， And not so much lying。

 More so withholding information， So it's not just like。

 You just kind of hold in a lot of who you are， And just like， No one really knows the true you。

 And what he says is， You achieve true happiness， There is no front or no difference。

 Between the you that's out there and really you， And he even talks about。

 He has like this retreat thing， Where he takes like people， And one of the exercises is。

 Well overall they have to agree never to lie， It's like if there's something you think you have to say。

 If you don't like someone you have to say， And it's like full honest about everything， Really？。

 What if they're like， Fat is shit， You're like， That's what you're generally thinking， It's like。

 yeah， you're fucking fat out， And then they have to be honest in their response， It's super harsh。

 But he takes it further， Where that's the general philosophy， And then there's a few exercises。

 It makes you do and one is， You have an hour， And you have to honestly tell。

 Your life story in an hour， Like the real life story， No， just generally， And he films it。

 And you have to like， Really tell like your experience in life， And he films it。

 And then from there you have to take that recording， You have to show your parents， Your family。

 all of your friends， And then you can immediately just by how you feel。

 Because this is how even I felt， I was like， oh shit， It's like you see where， Again。

 there's all this with holding， And putting on all these different responsibilities。

 There are people， And if you are able to kind of just， You see that， Now here it's very extreme。

 Like， But just to kind of keep thinking in that way， You'll just feel a lot more at ease。

 So what the girl is， Is like kind of， Get in the habit of doing that。

 And he even takes it further after that， Where he makes everyone sit down naked。

 And he makes you stand up naked， And talk about your body， Your insecurities， What you like。

 What you don't like， And he films that too， And then he makes you rewatch it， And everything。

 It's like a fool on， Being fully like， Radically honest， And the honest thing。

 It's like putting yourself out there， Also as he said kind of， Putting your intentions out there。

 And not feeling in a way， Deal to you or she， Just start whatever you're going to say with。

 So by the way， Or so anyway， And don't even， Even if you don't know what you're going to say。

 Just say those two words， So by the way， Tap tap， And if you look at you。

 And something will come up， You're like， oh， blib blib blib， Like that。

 Just kind of do it in a very leading， Not chasing， Like a way， It's like， So by the way， It's like。

 So by the way， It's like， Kind of breaking before a leading。

 It's not so much not taking it personally， It's just realizing， Like this is the natural way。

 This is how it is， It'd be weird， If everyone liked you， And you breathe something out there。

 It would be more natural， So it's kind of accepting， Like， One of the laws of nature。

 So I am going to give you a check， of course， Yeah， Yeah， So we're not even。

 Just not even viewing it as bad， Just like， of course， And here's，看全形式可以到最不足哪，大家的心情就會不太一樣。

就是自然花盾， Nunenwma，一起直軸，現在單r 들어가，上磁力，把那個角色就可以，把你的底部吸走，推出來，連一上磁校，比賽地方，只要脫下來，向起，按該場面，我已經之前放著，覺得，要去下去了，點聲。

你替你們，負 question，樓下，問我們要一起巷， самый引入，是很蠻蠻，很500，和，最後說，就像 proto，現在，像，你跟兩位 Women，同時，但暫時，現在，能哄自己，或說，說，放一個。

想怎麼樣，想，種個，很值得，但，這樣就會是不超力的，為了讓我問，你們想認識客人？，那種公平，樁骨，他們是自己的，好，要住在他的眼神，亦是公平，要不料理，他先站你，噻，他會駛 traumatic。

我會覺得他讓你餞養，Boss，OK，Boss，Boss，Boss，There's many ways of using it，In Pimple I talk about。

I get the control side of it，Like father， daughter， frame，OK，Oh and talks about it in the blueprints。

When he compares it to，The brush fire， versus the on-seering coal，OK，Rad talks about the wolf。

'cause like Bar King versus the gorilla，You need to make that switch there。

It's like although it's good like，You're excited and stuff，There's two things。

It's like one is coming from that place of meeting， versus just doing it because you want to，and two。

It just comes off to the girl is，Two try hard， two intense，So it's like this guy's too excited。

It's a little too boyish，Yeah，It takes away the groundedness，It's not very grounded。

It takes away the opportunity for her to chase you，and it makes shit unrelated。

It's a lot more powerful like doing less，and just being more grounded。

You know another way of viewing it too，is like the godfather，You can see that movie。

it's like the mock-up on students，That's how you should act，Like the number two guy。

the fucking mock-up，and funny enough that's a lot more powerful，Like you can be intimidating。

Hey how's it going，Or you can be like，Hey，It's to be you，But funny enough，That's more all。

Like gentle yet firm，That's what I say，Gentle yet firm，That there is even more intimidating。

And that's kind of what I want，It's not like it's treating aggressive，It's gentle yet firm。

Now you can still be again，Like have these bursts of fun，But it's also the place is coming from。

It's these little subtle tweaks，and revive，I need to do this，and kind of rush。

Verses I'm doing it to have fun，I'll say extreme things，I'm having a little burst of fun。

It's a lot lighter，This because the patient's coming from，Hey，So I'll break it down in layer，Okay，So。

one，Notice it with your behavior，Start to be discussed in，Buy it，Start directing your RAS towards it。

Anything that's overly reactive，Overly excited，Slow it down，From there，Try to find ways。

To get the same effect while doing less，From there，Try to go boring。

And that's going to be the challenge for you，And you mentioned at the bottom，It's like the breakdown。

It's like if it's not a challenge，She don't feel like it's like you're doing something。

But you're going 20-0，What you're doing now，It's not a challenge。

Because you're used to doing the more outgoing crazy shit，The challenge to where it'll be hard。

Is actually kind of controlling that，It's not going with the auto-pilot，Should they usually do。

Slow it down and boring it，Like making it more chill，Even more boring，It's going to be a lot harder。

Well still getting the girl that doing what you're doing now，So if that there，Init of itself。

It's where you have to go，That's the challenge，Okay，And that's what I was trying to do，It's like。

Try controlling it，Try going a little bit slow motion，And try boring it down。

Try finding where is the bare minimum，Where you still get the girl。

But bare minimum it turns up boring，And what I do，It's like do the minimum。

Try to make it as boring as possible，But still get the girl，Try to see where that line is。

Where the good enough line is，Okay，And that's the challenge，And the same with。

If you ever heard Owen's story back in the day，Like for even me，Like once you switch off routines。

It's kind of tough，Because you always want to go back to the fucking routines。

You have to actually condition yourself not to，The same here with you。

You're going to be conditioned to go back to that，Oh，You're going to be like no，Stick to this。

And you also notice，You may find it boring yourself，And then that's a tough part。

It's like how to still be engaged，Sowing it down there，Don't view it so much like。

Oh I wasted time building it up，It's like you have to build it up，To be able to get to this weekend。

It's like if you're like a shy guy，You can't just go to see how boring you can get。

You got to spike it，But then it's like，You can't get too lost with the spiking，It's like now。

It's like come back to full circle，And then you have both，And you're fucking golden。

And this will be tough，But just kind of keeping this mind will open like。

Like at least now you have a fucking lane，To work on，You know it's like it opens this whole new。

World of ways of doing challenge，Exactly，So that's what I kind of want you to focus on。

And once you kind of get accustomed to it，And once it's like burned in your mind，Like okay。

This is the good enough，From there you can choose，To re-bring the spiking into the mix。

But as I am sorry as I mentioned，It's not so much，It's not because you have to。

It's because you want to，And that's me and this is a subtle T in the mind。

We can both go up to the grill，I can fuck around and say knock the things。

But mine's a lot more light in here free，Because there's no need to do it，For you it's more so。

Okay game time，Oh my god，And it's like the girl that's like way，There's two ways of being on。

One where it's like always doing，Doing because you think you need to，The other on。

This is more so the difference between，Sake going for a job， Going for like say sales or something。

 versus girls，It's the on is more so，In a control type of way，It's more so like。

Not letting your mind get to you，Feeling at ease，The extruded environments， versus forcing something。

So it's kind of like resisting those，It's more like a control versus a doing。

And that's where the muscle and focus，Inattention goes，It's like when I'm out，I'm doing of course。

But my focus is not like okay，Let's fucking do this，It's more so，Let's do this，And remain，At ease。

 In the environment，At ease in terms of the outcome，Yeah I kind of like ground it amongst it all。

It's more so focused on remaining grounded，In at ease，Persus trying to force something。

When there's less of like doing doing，It's just a very aggressive vibe，It's more like centered。

Like less barking in the face，More gorilla，People will feel like it's，Compretation dog。

I'll still do little bursts，Like rest of it，So I'm talking to a girl。

Brad calls this like the preview，It's like give her a little，It's like plan to see，Like if I hug her。

That little pun，Or I might like pull her in，Do a little hair pull，Like little bursts，And her mom。

It's back to the fun vibe，And that's a lot of it，It's like fun vibe，And little bursts of everything。

If I'm talking to girls，I feel like if I feel like，I need to quickly，Say get a good reaction。

Or to be somewhere else，I'm not，I'm not myself now，It's all good，It's like that。

So that's where your focus should be，I'm like maintaining that light。

Hernanus was trying to create something，Apart 2 of say being a man，Be grounded and be distracted。

Is controlling your emotions，So even though you do feel that excitement，It's a muscle。

And that's where your focus should be，So slow it down，And not buy into it。

If you're a guy who feels excitement，And you buy into it too much，I'm like run around like crazy。

So the girl shows a lack of control of emotions，So let's just say you get into relationship with her。

And you get mad，You wouldn't be able to control the madness，You may be shit out，And that makes sense。

Yeah，Thus the ground and control，Killer of the vibe，Makka control，That doesn't mean you repress them。

So feel them，But you should be able to take perspective，And act in a calibrated way。

For a proactive way，Verse is reacting like crazy to them，I'm letting them overwhelm you。

It's connecting with her in a way，It's that empathy side of things。

You learn this like you guys did routines，So one thing you get from routines。

You deliver the routine and then you look at how they were reacted。

And then you pick the next one depending on what she for reaction was，Funny enough。

That's the skill that I want，You also to focus on more，It's like you're going in。

And here it's not so much routine，It's being yourself fully，And you express something。

But it's not just you being yourself without being aware of the girl。

It's then you turn into like the drunk crazy guy，Yeah he's being himself。

He's been ruined but no one can relate，And you can kind of fall into that too。

If you just go too crazy，So it's more so I'm doing my fun。

But I'm always looking back to make sure she's still part of it，It's just like fun，I look after，Okay。

 she's a little tense，I'm going to do something that's still congruent。

But that's a little more chill，So she's able to relate，Then if it's like too boring。

And she starts looking away，I'm going to do something that's still congruent。

But it's a little bit more out there，To add some more pressure and get her in。

So it's always me doing，I'm looking，I'm looking，We have to have the look to read，What she's feeling。

What she's thinking，And I make was you on that too，I'll come up to you for a few interactions。

And I'll be like，Okay， what's this girl feeling right now？，What she's thinking。

I kind of get you thinking in that way，I'm putting yourself in her shoes。

And there's any discrepancy in the read，Find ways to like heal at ease in the environment。

Find ways to decompress，Find ways to relieve the tension even，You know， the worst vibe you can have。

And that's kind of what I mentioned，Is like like a horror battery，It's like。

It's like the electric unit，If you will，That's kind of like the vibe，It will go well for a bit。

But it's not sustainable，Over the course，It's like the girls may like it initially。

But then you spike it too much，Where it's either unrelatable，Or they're like，Okay。

 this guy's too much，He can't slow it down，It's coming from place，If he needs to do it。

And it turns into an insecurity，And then they bounce out，Okay，Also，As I mentioned。

Try pouring it down，But in a way that still congruence，Okay，Try having more。

 Like actual like conversation，Without like just saying only funny things。

Give space for the girls to talk as well，They can pause， lean back，And enjoy it too。

And she's partaking，You know，Because that's what you're always like，Doing， doing， doing， doing。

To the girl，But she has to do as well，If that makes sense，You want the girl to chase。

Even when I'm like leaning in，I say something，Then I'm like，Can I let her chase，Ideally it's like。

You're so much of the shit，That you can be boring，And still get the hog girl。

You don't even have to be crazy，It's a cool shit。
