這個，你買了進一件事，與業務，來 之間，台貨曠的，義氣的，頗不 tteokbokki， wenn別人都減了，我告訴你什麼事，的確可以用，進入，剛剛受 parte，onzout，提agn的，我想，。。

點形，結讀，四兩，他，我 fifteen，我說，還有什麼關會，對，這是休息第一排， Whoever is trying the most， whoever is working。

 whoever is talking the most is trying to get an outcome。， So if you can trigger that investment。

 if you can trigger that attempt for an outcome， if you can trigger that in the other person，。

 you're going to get a lot of investment from them。。

 You'll use that investment to then build attraction。。

 You initially want to come into interactions by building comfort right off the bat。。

 You build comfort right off the bat because you can't assume that you already have that rapport。。

 Then the next step is you want to break rapport， usually by disqualifying。。

 So the next step is you break that rapport which sparks the attraction。。

 And then you qualify which builds the attraction like wildfire， makes it spread。。

 And then you add sexual escalation onto it。， This is a cyclical pattern that's going to happen many。

 many times throughout your interaction， throughout your night with each individual girl。。

 This is your game layer。， So if you want to be super technical about this， you have the game layer。

 you have the logistical layer， and then you have the physical layer， all happening simultaneously。。

 As the night's progressing。， Now that gets a little more complicated。。

 I'm going to have some sheets that you can download after for all of the gifts you guys that you can see how it kind of goes by。

， The layer that I'm going to show you how those go by simultaneously if you want to get a little more complicated with it。

， If I had first though， I just want to show you how the game layer should go。

 which is how to build as much investment from them as possible。。

 Literally you can get more compliance using this model and anything else。。

 You'll get more attraction from using this。， And you'll do it in a way where you could game with this model at your workplace。

， You could game in this model at any sort of social get together with no repercussion because you're triggering investment from them。

， So step number one for this is the physical part of it， right？， You always want to be locked in。。

 I'll get you guys the whole thing after two。， So don't worry about it。。

 You always want to be physically locked in and you want to match head height。。

 So when you first approach， you want to have your head heights matched。。

 Meaning if she's sitting down， you want to grab a chair and sit down。。

 You always want to void the 30 minutes of awkwardness and collect the first three seconds of awkwardness。

， Meaning if you have to move a chair， if you have to create something， some awkward situation。

 some tense situation。， Even if it's just for a few seconds to get yourself into a place where you could talk to her now for 30 minutes or longer。

 you want to do that。， Rather than putting yourself in a situation where you just kind of stand over her。

， You're really awkward at first where you're then avoiding the initial three seconds of awkwardness。

， But then you're saving yourself the next， you're trying to save yourself the next 30 minutes。。

 But in reality， every minute that goes by， your next or being strained。

 you're forcing the investment in the wrong path。， So you start off with that body language of getting them to invest in you。

， You do this in such a way where you're always locked in up against some object。。

 So every time you approach a girl， make sure that your back is up against a wall or a bar。。

 Make sure that you're over the shoulder。， Make sure you're always in a situation where it looks like they're orbiting around you。

 where they're trying to get your attention。， This works twofold。， Number one。

 it works because you could hit on every girl in the venue。。

 You could build your social circle the exact same time as your cold approaching。。

 And nobody will ever be the wiser。， Nobody will ever look at you like you're this creepy PUA guy。

 this creepy player guy。， I've approached thousands and thousands of sets， tens of thousands of sets。

 I've taught thousands of students。， No one has ever accused me of being a pick-up artist in a nightclub。

， Because I'm always having as much fun as possible， not thinking about what I'm doing。， But then B。

 or at least not having it apparent that I'm thinking about what I'm doing。， And then B。

 I'm always locked in。， It's always， other people are trying to talk to me in a venue， always。。

 So that helps the outward effect of everybody not thinking that you're this weirdo trying to hit on everybody and be this creepy PUA guy escalating on everybody that you see。

， which allows you to approach the entire venue without burning it down。

 which then does what's your confidence。， Makes your confidence skyrocket。

 Your self-esteem goes through the roof when you don't feel like this weirdo escalator guy is trying to just escalate on these girls。

， Then it builds attraction with her inward because she's going to feel that she's over-investing in you。

， She's going to feel that her body's turned towards you。。

 And that will just lead into more and more compliance to the interaction。， Very， very powerful。。

 It kills me that a lot of guys fail to just focus on this one thing of the physical investment。。

 So a very simple way to do this is there's six categories of openers。。

 First category is the observational opener。， Second category is complement opener。。

 Third category is functional。， Fourth category is direct。， Fifth category is opinion。。

 And sixth category is the introduction。， I don't repeat any of those days。 It sounds pretty good。。

 Cool。， I like to use the observational and the complement opener the best because it gets me a much higher and better yield on what I'm putting into it when I'm getting out of it。

， Functional opener is fantastic if I have a bet。， If I'm doing a bet with somebody。

 I'm going to do a functional opener because the chances of success are closer to 100%。。

 So it's a fun parlor check。， You ask somebody， hey， do you know the nearest coffee shop is？。

 You ask some girl， hey， do you know where the nearest Chipotle is？ You hate you？。

 Do you have time to place closes？， It's a very low risk， low reward opener。。

 But it will trigger response。， That's why it's good for the bet because you can get some response。。

 You can build up from it。 It's very clever。， On the other end of the spectrum， you have direct。。

 A direct open example。， That would be。。。， I just had to stop you。 You're absolutely gorgeous。。

 My name is Luke。 What's your name？， I'd be kicking myself all day if I come over and say hi to you。。

 What's your name？， You're putting it all out there。 You're in full interest。。

 That's highest risk highest reward。， When that works， it works really， really well。。

 But it's the lowest consistency level of all the openers，， no matter how good you are at it。。

 The reason why is even if the girl is attracted to you and it seems to work，。

 it puts a lot of pressure on her。， She now has to really make that decision of not only does she find you attractive。

， does she like you， but。。。， does she have the confidence to actually engage in this conversation with you？

， Also， too。， Also， too。 You're going to find that the guys who are pure direct guys，。

 oftentimes just don't have the balls with a knowledge to run sets properly，。

 to run interactions properly， from a point of no attraction to building that interaction up further。

， Observational。 It's my favorite opening category，， but it's a little bit more tricky。。

 It's a little bit difficult to do because you can't create like a default list of them。。

 It's a little bit difficult to just come up with them on the fly。。

 I'm going to give you guys some exercise on how to do that， though。。

 Observation is the best because it puts yourself in their shoes，， builds a lot of empathy。

 a lot of instants，， a lot of instantaneous， you're wearing the same shoes kind of mentality。， So。

 one easier way to do this is to point out the weather。， It's kind of a silly example。

 but it just kind of shows you the framework。， Come up with your own examples。。

 You're on a street corner in the fall。， It's getting to be a little bit chilly。。

 Let's say you're on the East Coast。， You see a really attractive girl you want to open。。

 First thing you do is you say a statement that's a blanket statement，， a little bit louder。

 just to nobody in particular。， Holy shit， it's cold out here。。

 And then you're going to notice a couple of people look at you，， because people don't look at you。

 It doesn't matter。， Then you look at the girl that you want to open，， and you say， excuse me。

 did you make it this cold？， Again， if you want to build a bit extra rapport，。

 stutter on the open just a little bit to make it seem like you haven't done this。

 500 times earlier today。， And she's going to say， oh no， the accusation opener works really well。。

 When you accuse a girl of something， you combine that with the observation opener。。

 It works fantastic。， When you accuse the girl of something， it puts them on edge，。

 which then calls them to start investing， especially if you can build the comfort back up。。

 It does a bit of a whip lash investment spike。， Next one， compliment。。

 You want to compliment the girl on something she's worked for or attained，。

 not something that is something with handager or given to her。， Meaning you never want to say， wow。

 you're really beautiful。， Right？， You never want to say， wow， you're really beautiful。， Instead。

 what you want to say is， hold these shit。， I like the fact that you master shoes with your belt。。

 That's amazing。 Keep it up。， It's a very powerful compliment opener，。

 because you're assuming a lot of authority in the topic at hand，。

 even if you have no idea about accessories。， All romantic shoes。， Hopefully， her shoes match。， No。

 you probably don't want the fact that you've got a match with shoes。， It's not necessarily a name。。

 Exactly。， Anything she's worked for， hair is phenomenal with this。， That's a lay， I gotta do that。。

 Hair is phenomenal。， Hair is fucking phenomenal，， because they spend so much time in their hair。。

 When you say， your hair looks。。。， Hey， I just had to stop you real quick。， I even like to say。

 excuse me， terribly sorry to bother you。， Excuse me， so sorry to bother you。， Excuse me， oh， my bad。

， What does that do？ It lowers the wall。， You always have time and interaction to be Mr。 Alpha，。

 to be Mr。 Tough Guy。， But if you come into it， if you come into the interaction，。

 speaking the way that I speak， having a deep pitch，， and non-seating。

 being very clear with what you're saying，， again， having a lot of intent， but with holding interest。

， you can separate these two things。， If you can be competent enough to separate these two things，。

 you're going to have much more consistent results。， You go in and you say， excuse me。

 so sorry to bother you。， She's going to look at you， and usually she's going to do what？。

 Participate。， Oh， it's okay。 She's going to give you some response。， So sorry to bother you。。

 But I just had to say， your hair is amazing。， And I'm going to look at it。。

 It's the best fucking hair I've ever seen in my life。， Holy shit， your hair is amazing。。

 You just want to pierce through your eyes with your eyes。， So when you do that compliment opening。

 right？， Oh， excuse me， so sorry to bother you。， Your hair is amazing。， And she's going to go， oh。

 the more over the top， you can say it， right？， The more she's going to say what？， Oh， my God。

 thank you。， Oh， you want to make that compliment crazy， crazy big。， Okay？， And then you say。

 have a good day， and then you turn to walk away。， When you turn to walk away。

 it proves that you're not there， to get anything from her。， A lot of guys when they say， oh， wow。

 you're really beautiful。， Well， they buy a drink。， Those aren't bad things individually。。

 The problem is what the guy is after in return or in response。， When you say， wow。

 you're really beautiful。， You're not trying to just genuinely give the girl the compliment。。

 Because when a guy says， wow， you're really beautiful，， he steps closer to the girl， when she says。

 thank you，， he then comes up with something else to say，， which takes something from her。。

 It's kind of like when you give a girl a kiss。， One of the biggest things that changed my entire mindset with game。

 is when a girl told me， she's like， hey，， you guys keep talking about getting a kiss or getting a K-close。

 or some dorky way that we used to say it。， And she's like， you know， it's not about getting a kiss。。

 It's about giving a kiss。， Giving a kiss， that's what girls really want to hear。

 and what they want to be treated like。， I was like， oh， man， that's actually a really good point。。

 Game should not be this thing that you're taking from the other person。。

 It should be this thing that you're purely contributing to them。。

 So when you give the girl the compliment，， you should be wrapping up something that she worked for or attained。

 or built herself， her hair， her style， her outfit pattern， whatever it is。， Her lashes， for example。

， Her lashes are fantastic。 Eyes are terrible to compliment on，， but lashes are perfect。。

 You once you're able to wrap that up and then say， keep it up。， That assumes a lot of authority，。

 which doesn't cause them to want to invest further。， Then you turn， start walking away。， Hey。

 have a good day。， You're literally forcing it that you don't actually care。

 about furthering the interaction。， You're forcing it to， you're not forcing it。。

 You're making it very clear that you don't want anything， from this interaction。。

 You're forcing it to show， you're forcing the situation。

 to show that you don't want anything from her。， They're just giving that compliment you're starting to leave。

， When you turn to leave， the reason why you want to leave。

 as authoritatively and strong will as possible，， is because you know the next thing she's going to say。

， Even the craziest， most negative girl in the world， is at least going to say thank you。

 to you giving the her the compliment。， That's where after here。。

 We're after seguing ourselves into the next part of the interaction。。

 That's what's going to give you consistent results。， So when you turn to leave and you walk away。

 she says thank you。， You turn and you go a positive frame of an open-ended question。。

 The positive frame is， wow， you're actually really friendly。。

 Notice that when I say actually really friendly，， what is that implying？。

 I'm surprised that she's so friendly。， Well， you're actually really friendly。。

 And then you ask an open-ended question。， The positive frame is going to ensure that she answers。

 your open-ended question much more effectively， with a lot more investment。， Well。

 you're actually really friendly where you from。， The girl says， Texas， New York， Philly， Baltimore。

 whatever。， She says， let's say she says New York。， You immediately now want to break rapport。

 because you've built up the rapport。， You've built up an initial comfort at the earlier stage。。

 The whole point of building that is so that you can now use it。。

 So you can break some of that rapport。， You don't want to sever the rapport。。

 You don't want to pull the attraction， tension， rubber bands，， so much that it snaps。。

 But you do want to test it a little bit。， So， first， an easy one to say。， That's a good framework。。

 Is it the truth they say about girls from New York？， It's not of an amazing one， but it works。。

 The T is that you're using that， right？， We're drilling it down from 40，000 foot-view。

 deeper and deeper。， The reason why that works so well is because you don't know what they necessarily say。

， But she does。， So let's say you meet a girl from Wichita。， Wow， you're actually really friendly。

 Where are you from？， She go， I'm from Wichita。， Is it the truth they say about girls from Wichita？。

 Right？ The girl's going to go， I don't know。， What do they say？， Or what have you heard？， Or no。

 we're not all about surraging sluts。， But yes， we all live on our farm。。

 She's going to fight back with you。， You want that dissonance。。

 You want that friction that she fights back with you。。

 Then what happens happening is that friction is the investment。， Oftentimes， you're going to know，。

 if you're going to get your first flirtatious slap， right？。

 You're going to get a bit of a push to the shoulder。， You're going to say， oh。

 I can't believe you said that。， Or sometimes they're going， oh， what do they say？。

 And then you're just going to look at it and go， oh， it's true， isn't it？。

 Because you don't actually need to know what they say。。

 The whole point is to trigger that breaking rapport， to get that spark of attraction。。

 So when she starts questioning me about it，， or she starts saying， oh， what do they say？， I go， oh。

 I knew it was true。， I got it。， And the girl is going， oh， now tell me what they say。。

 Tell me what they say。， And if she doesn't， it doesn't matter。， Again， the goal is not，。

 the goal is to kind of just shift things into place， so that you have consistent results。， Again。

 even if you want to like all of a sudden， go direct and go a bunch of statements of intent。

 right after this， you can do that。， But you're always going to have a much better success。。

 If you open with a strong grounded opener，， turn to leave， she says some response，。

 that sucks you back in。， Because you're flipping the script immediately。。

 You're triggering the investment immediately，， rather than you giving her the open，。

 and then do what most guys do is hop up on that soapbox，。

 and watch the girl just wait for you to give her， a bunch more lines， or even if you were funny，。

 she's going to wait for you to kind of keep being funny。， Whereas if you keep doing these takeaways。

 right？， So first takeaway is that first one。， And then when she says， oh， no。

 we're not all a bunch of whatever。， You know， you give that bit of a tease， right？。

 Another tease is， oh man， I didn't notice。， You have nice hair。

 but where did you get those extensions at？， Did you get your weave in town， or is it， you know，。

 mail order？， Oh， it's not a weave。 Well， 90% of girls have extensions， right？， So it's a good tease。

， Okay？， Another simple one， right？， Any tease about her appearance。。

 So categorize a break-strip report，， disqualification。， After you deliver the opener，。

 and then you're in the conversational bit further，， you want to disqualify。。

 Disqualifying is way better than showing your intent， right off the bat。， Because disqualifying。

 again，， whether you're in a work setting or group setting，。

 or you're just trying to approach the girl， right off the bat， disqualifying sparks that investment。

， flips that script， gets her chasing you very， very quickly，， very， very aggressively。

 very tenaciously。， So I like girls with round butts， for example， right？， So all of a sudden，。

 hit on the girl who's got an amazing ass，， and I'll start talking to her，。

 and I'll get her to laugh a couple times，， and I'll tell her， wow， you're amazing。， It's too bad。。

 When I say it's the cliffhangers，， the cliffhangers are an easy way to get participation。

 back in the interaction。， God， you're amazing。， It's just too bad。， The girl's going to say， what？。

 What's too bad？， But that's such an over-the-top compliment。。

 She's excited to be in this conversation。， Well， what's too bad？， I'm going to go。

 it's just too bad。， You don't have a round enough butt。， It's too bad your butt isn't big enough。。

 Well， I'm going to only say that to a girl who's got a，。

 who knows that she's wearing the right type of pants。， She knows that she has that really nice butt。

， Right？ You want to always disqualify on a topic， that is something or a thing。

 that is something that she already has as a positive trait。。

 Because it will get them to fulfill that box even further。， Go to even longer extent。。

 Further extent for you。， So then when she， immediately， almost every single girl。

 will kind of turn her back and go，， what do you mean it's not big enough？。

 What do you mean it's not，， but will， but will but enough， right？， I'm going to go， no， no， no。

 it's amazing。， It's very， very nice。， Because the reason I'm saying， no， no。

 it's amazing is because， she turned around to physically invest in me。， Right？

 Different types of investments。， Time， emotion， money， the physical， the physical investment。。

 When she turns around， I want to roar that。， I'm like， oh， no， no， no， no， no， no， no。。

 It's amazing。 Your butt's fantastic。 It's great。， It's just， I couldn't， you know。

 I couldn't say anything on it。， That's the problem。， I need， I need mine to be functional。。

 When I say， when I say， I need to be functional，， you're taking the beauty out of the situation。。

 You're taking the， the male-female dynamic out of it，。

 which then causes her to create a male-female dynamic。， You don't want to be a man to woman。。

 You want to trigger her to try to be a man to woman with you。。

 You don't want to DHV your stories of her。， You don't want to trigger it， so she's DHV into you。。

 So how do you trigger her being a man to woman to you？， Well， you tell her， oh， you're。

 you're amazing。， It's too bad。 She goes， what's too bad？， Oh， your butt， it's just。

 it's not quite big enough。， It's not quite， it's not booty-licious enough。。

 This dork is that sounds right。， Then what happens is the girl says， oh my god， yeah， that is。。

 I go， oh， it's just not functional。， Functional， again， it causes her to be more sexual。。

 Because I say， oh， it's not functional。， Well， functional is a very。

 almost utilitarian kind of word， right？， So when I say， it's very sterile。， So I go， oh。

 it's just not functional。， What do you mean？ I go， I just can't put my drink on it。。

 So the next bit is this。， Again， I don't really care about the drink on her，。

 but it's all one big bit。， The whole point is participation， buy-in。， Again。

 this is after a few sentences of talking in the girl。。

 I just want a lot of physical buy-in from her。， I want a lot of verbal buy-in。。

 I want a lot of sexual buy-in without me actually having to show any interest。。

 Notice the name of the game is how high can you get your attraction equity。

 without you having to show up at your cards。， The more attraction equity you can get by being this sexual。

， the better off you're going to be。， So when I say， oh， it's purely functional。， It's not even。

 it's not even me。， I don't even， I don't even like love ask that much。。

 And now look over to her friend。， I mean， I kind of do。， But， right， to play with it a little bit。

 right？， But I go， it's really just functional。， I really just have to know that if I want to walk across this bar。

， and I am on my phone， I'm checking the scenery out，， I want to know。

 can I have my drink walk with me， without me having to do any effort？， Or， I mean。

 you know what I'm saying？， And what that does is it's such an elaborate flirtation。

 that it gets the girl to be， if she doesn't laugh for the first part，。

 she doesn't laugh for the second， she doesn't laugh for the second，。

 she doesn't laugh for the third。， You're going to hook it very， very easily。， It's very consistent。。

 So then what happens to the girl says， oh， yeah， you can。。

 You can set it on my butt if you draw it out like molasses。。

 You drag out the game the way I'm showing you guys。， Every time the girl will say， oh， yeah。

 you can。， You can put it on my butt。， I go， okay， let me see。， So I'll set my drink on her ass。。

 Maybe I'll drink out of it。， She'll maybe she'll start twerking。， I go， no， no， no， no， no， no， no。

 no， no。， As much as I love your twerking，， holy shit。

 you don't even know what it's doing to me right now。。

 And then I'll throw a couple of sexual escalators in。

 because we now went through the comfort breaker， poor qualifies successfully。。

 Notice we already went through that a couple of iterations。， A couple of iterations。。

 Notice we already went through the entire cycle，， a couple of iterations。， So when she started。

 a lot of times the girl will start twerking， after you put the drink on her butt， right？， And again。

 this isn't like a routine you guys have to do。， This is just an example， an anecdote from my game。

 that you guys can kind of pull from and piece together， for your own game。。

 You have to take it and take it if you want，， but there's plenty of things you guys can do on your own。

， So when the girl starts twerking， I go， no， no， no， no。， As much as I love that twerking， again，。

 I'm about to insert a sexual escalator， right？， As much as I love that twerking， I mean。

 don't get me wrong。， It's got me to like 40% right now。。

 I say it's got me to 40% in terms of the size of my erection。， Oh， wait。 All right。， You got。

 all right， stop。， You got me to 50%， 50%。， Okay。 When you're talking about the size of your erection。

 in terms of a percentage， it's within a few minutes， of talking to the girl， she's very，。

 it's a massive sexual escalator。， It's a way better than any sort of handsy thing。

 that you could possibly do。， If anything， you want to be physically hands off the girl。

 and verbally very suggestive to get consistent results。， If you don't want consistent results。

 then do the whole， handsy escalation thing。， That's fine。 A lot of guys don't need as consistent。

 results as what I want。， They're okay with， they're okay with a less aggressive， approach。

 A less aggressive approach to their results。， So you want a less aggressive approach to results。。

 You don't really care about the outcome at all。， Then just do， just go ahead and be super handsy。。

 Whichever girl ends up wanting that， that's fine。， That's not my style。， My style is very。

 very hands off to the point where，， you know， you'll kind of push their all away from you。。

 Do roll offs。， Okay。 So once you get that sexual escalator，。

 she's kind of kind of stand up and like，， oh my god， I can't believe you said that。， I go， I know。

 I can't believe you did that。， Shit， anyway， who'd you come here with？。

 And then you go to the logistical questions。， Makes sense so far？， Sweet。。

 Every time that the girl responds to you in a pro-U， investment way， you're going to want a reward。。

 Simple rewards are， wow， that's so cool。， I'm really proud of you。， I respect somebody who。

 and then fill in the blank， with the thing that they just said。， Well。

 I really respect somebody who's able to come out， with their coworkers and not， you know，。

 keep that work-life balance。， That's awesome。， And then you follow up with the question。。

 More breaks in report。， Other breaks in report categories。， So you have disqualifying。。

 You have teasing， bantering， negging。， Teasing and bantering， negging is kind of the typical stuff。

 that everybody does。， It's very easy to tease。， Neg is like a reverse compliment。。

 Compliment sandwich。， Just point of girls， wrinkles out on her eyes，。

 point out the gaps in her teeth，， point out a mole， whether this stuff is there or not。， Again。

 this isn't meant to be。， This is meant to spark that initial report。。

 It's meant to get them all riled up。， Also， another one is calling out different things。

 that they're doing。， So let's say you tease the girl，， and then she smiles on certain way，。

 or she looks away。， Call her out for each thing。， Like， oh， no。

 it's really cute that you get shy and insecure， when you're bantered with。。

 When you have jokes made with you。， As she's looking away。。

 So that's going to make her even more shy。， I have more anxiety about what she's doing，。

 because you're calling it out。， And it's really clever to just kind of call out。

 each thing that she's doing。， No， it's cute that you look away when somebody teases you。。

 That's adorable。， Another easy way to do that is always say that's cute。

 or that's adorable to whatever negates that you said。。

 That way it really solidifies that it's a positive thing。， It's not just you talking shit。。

 Verbal and physical games。， Verbal and physical games。。

 Verbal games would be any sort of tongue twister that you know。， So loads of tongue twister。。

 You can just Google out there。， Any sort of tongue twister you just say with the girl。。

 Silly repetitive jokes。， Kind of the heinous jokes， the craft jokes。， You know， the dead baby jokes。

 the Helen Keller jokes。， The jokes that you'd say with your buddies， right？， The army。

 the locker room jokes， the army jokes。， Things that you know， you normally never say to the girls。。

 If you say it， if you say these jokes to your wingman， or to the girl in set。。

 And most people would never actually say these types of things。。

 You'll notice the girl will be starkly offended at first。。

 But then all of a sudden she'll start voicing her own。， It's actually a really empowering。

 interesting thing to do， while you're in set with women。， Now the opposite。。

 Let's say you try to get the girl to invest and she doesn't。， Let's say you asked the girl。

 so what's the craziest thing you did this week？， And she goes， nah， nothing really。。

 Using the operant conditioning that we were discussing，， you have to punish that。。

 But people don't really respond very well to negative conditioning。。

 So you have to do a bit of a neutral response and then focus on rewarding more aggressively。

 as they give you positive investment。， So then when the girl says， nah， you know， nothing really。。

 You tease it。， So they all come on， don't be lame and do a bit of a roll off。， A bit of a takeaway。。

 Either turn your back to the roll off or kind of do a takeaway，， walk a few feet away and come back。

， You're going to notice any guy who's really， really solid in game。。

 He's going to do a lot of roll off and takeaways。， Where he physically moves， five。

 ten feet from the drone comes back，， five to feet from the drone comes back。。

 Because that keeps that investment rolling。， Shit tests are even good。。

 Because the shit tests imply that she's breaking her port with you。， And the girl's teasing you。

 even if it's busting her balls pretty hard。， Oftentimes the girls who bust your balls the hardest are the ones who like you the most。

， But for us， we have words like shit tests or lack of compliance。。

 Because we don't really want that。， A lot of guys aren't sure how to handle that。， I love it。

 I welcome it。， The more a girl gives you a run for your money，， the better you're going to learn。。

 The more social skills you're going to develop。， And really， the more she likes you，。

 she's just participating in the arena that you're participating in。。

 So when you're getting a negative response，， and then again。

 a negative response is only a low-committal response。， Let's say you asked her，， hey。

 was it crazy that you did this week？， And she says， oh， nothing。。

 And you want to verbally and physically create a neutral to negative response。。

 So you lightly push her away。， The way you push her away is you've got to put your hand on her shoulder。

， And you step away。， You don't push her。 You push yourself away。。

 So that way you're not actually moving her at all。， You're moving yourself。。

 And then do a bit of a roll off。， Walk away a couple of feet。， Come back。。

 So you're withholding that energy and emotion from her。， Then you come back and say， come on。

 don't be lame。， What's one thing that you did today？， So you do as you give the teas，。

 which is don't be lame。， There's a bunch of teas that you could do， just a simple one。。

 And then you follow it up with a way for her to say face， and jump through a smaller hoop。。

 The smaller hoop is，， what's one thing you did today？。

 It's a lot easier for her to answer that than it is， to answer the original question，。

 which is the craziest thing you did all week。， But if you just teas and just do the roll off，。

 without giving that option for her to jump through that smaller hoop，。

 then you just left a situation where she just teased。， And the report has just been broken，。

 but there's no actual opportunity for her to reinvest and reengage。。

 After you've broken her poor effectively，， you want to do aggressive qualification。。

 Qualification has three different stages to it。， The first stage of qualification is small talk。。

 It's just getting the girl to open up about very simple things， that most people talk about。。

 We're really typical water cooler type talk，， boring guy conversation。。

 The point of this is to get a little bit of compliance，， to build it up a little bit。。

 So to show her that you're going to make her feel really good。

 about answering and participating into this conversation， and investing with you。。

 So you can even ask boring，， show-dee questions like，， what do you for work？， Where are you from？。

 Just really simple shit。， Because you're going to be able to use your aggressive。

 qualification later in your breaks and report， in order to build this into a much more interesting conversation。

， much more layered conversation。， The problem with asking boring questions are，。

 most guys who ask boring questions are boring。， They just don't know where to take it。。

 They're not trading a sort of fear missing out。， They're not trading any sort of unique situations for her。

， They're literally just asking the boring questions。， So if you ask the boring questions，。

 what happens is it creates a very safe undertone， and a good fundamental layer to the conversation。

 to the interaction for then you to jump forward in。， So what you jump forward is your whole goal，。

 it's really 80% qualification，， 20% breaks and report if you were to put it into a ratio。。

 The breaks and report are only to spark the investment， so you can get to qualification。。

 The goal is for the girl to be talking 80% of the time， and you talk 20% of the time。。

 At the beginning of the interaction，， it's going to be you talking 80% her talking 20。

 because you're going to have to open， prompt it。， The burden of the pick up is on you。。

 So you're going to have to spool it up。， But then as the conversation progresses，。

 you're going to notice that she's going to start saying things， like， I feel like， you know。

 everything about me， and I know nothing about you。。

 She's going to start prompting you for information。， And the best way to do this is to give。

 us little information about yourself as possible，， but still spin it so that she's giving you。

 as much information about herself as possible。， You want to get her to tell you her demonstration。

 of higher value stories。， You want to get her to tell you the different sexual things。

 that she has in mind。， You want to get her to tease you instead of you。

 having to always do the work。， You're going to notice that at the end of a good hour。

 to our interaction after you've flipped the script， so many times， she's going to， she's almost。

 to be exhausted of gaming you。， She's going to wonder why you're the only guy。

 that's gotten her to tell you these crazy stories， that are in level two and three qualification。。

 Why you're the only guy that's been able to get her。

 to bust out her jokes and wonder why she's trying， to get you so engaged and talkative with her。。

 It's amazing。， You're able to gain girls right in front of their friends。。

 You're able to actually build an intuitive level of attraction。

 where it increases your consistency with women， rather than a random high-volume approach。

 or you're not really sure what's going to happen， that relies on eye contact alone。。

 When you're gaming the style，， you have massive consistency。， You can see， hey， you know what， hey，。

 I'm at my opening 10 girls a night，， 100 girls a night， am I trying to pull one girl a night。。

 You're able to actually see these numbers。， And again， when you're in field，。

 when you're actually talking to girls out at nightclubs bars， in the daytime。

 you don't want to be so focused on the numbers。， You won't be so focused on this technique，。

 but you want to categorize it。， So you're going to give yourself a certain portion of the day。

 where you look at the videos， study this stuff，， and then another portion of the day。

 where you just forget about it completely， and you just act off instinct。。

 This is how you can build your intuition over time。， Yeah， so here's the thing。， With investment。

 you have to decide， content isn't always the same。。

 Investment with one person is always the same with another。， So it starts small。。

 It starts with compliance， billions。， So you， I mean， even asking girls。

 like what their favorites are。， Right？， You ask her what her favorite thing is。， Make it a game。。

 Make it a challenge for her to actually try to get out of you， the actual response。

 the proper investment responses。， Don't be so crazy that you won't give her the answers。。

 You have to eventually give them the cookie。， You can't just dangle it forever。。

 But when you ask her，， hey， what's your favorite place you ever traveled to？， And the girls。

 the girls are like， oh，， Mauritius， it's amazing。， Of course， to Africa， it's this beautiful place。。

 It's cheap， it's amazing， it's so cool。， And she goes， what's your favorite place？。

 You ever travel to。， You can look at it and just be like， holy shit，， that's really。

 really cool that you have a place， that's so unique that you like to travel to。， That's amazing。。

 And then she's going to go， well， no， thank you。， But where do you like to go？， And I go， no。

 that's really cool。， You pick the place that's not just a normal boring Miami。

 or just a normal place that most girls would say。， That's epic。， That's really cool。。

 I really respect that about you。， And then even before， like， lately，。

 I was almost even busing us in my cowl lines before，， because then she's going， oh， no。

 what's your favorite place？， I go， no， you know what？， You smart。， You loyal。。

 And she's going to kind of giggle and go，， I appreciate you。， You know。

 80% of girls maybe a little more， are going to get it and she's going to laugh。。

 And they're off the topic entirely。， And then I'm now on to another qualifier。。

 And now you want to get into midgame， is level two qualification questions。。

 So that chunk of game in the middle， that a lot of guys get bored in。

 or they get confused or they get frustrated that，， you know， the beginning of the end is exciting。。

 The middle is where the stuff happens。， And the stuff is allowing yourself to build such a trust。

 with the girl that a lot of guys like they'll try to pull， and they'll wonder， you know。

 why is the girl not pulling？， She's laughing， she's attracted。。

 But they didn't build the meat and potatoes of the trust， in the middle。， And at a certain point。

 once you're trying to pull， it's too late。， You can't go back and build that。。

 So as level two qualification questions，， are questions like， what's more important？。

 To be crazy or to be spontaneous？， Another example would be a scale of 1 to 10。， How crazy are you？。

 How wild are you on a scale of 1 to 10？， What's the wildest vacation that you ever took？。

 It's subtly prompting a bit of sexuality。， It's kind of giving her an olive branch。

 to run with it if she wants to。， But it's a very， very strong mid-level。。

 The whole point of this is to get her to tell you anecdotes，， stories。

 situations that happened to her。， You want to pull out all of her reference experiences。， Right？

 Pick up as a two-way street。， Pick up is about getting her to participate，。

 get her head in the game，， rather than you just forcing it upon the girl。。

 And you're going to notice your success， right goes through the roof。。

 You're going to invest in it with your compliance or with the roof。， Once you focus on it，。

 if you can actually combine this investment style of game。

 with the logistics that we discussed in the other module，。

 you're going to notice that you don't even have to pull girls， with a plausible liability。。

 The investment will be so strong that she'll just ditch her friends， at the club。 She's so excited。。

 She's so wrapped up in you。， You can notice that your sales ability goes through the roof。。

 Your networking ability goes through the roof。， That people just genuinely are excited to be hanging out with you。

， We talk about how to actually create fear missing out， and create a unique situation around you。

 where you create stories and cause a fuss around yourself。。

 It's extremely easy to do that if you're able to build， an investment with everybody that you meet。。

 If you're able to build a strong level investment， with everybody that you meet，。

 the story is there。， They're just so excited that they are able to meet。

 somebody that they connected with so well。， You have to understand，。

 everyone's favorite topic of conversation is what themselves。， So let that happen。。

 Just encourage it。， Encourage people to talk about themselves。， Hey。

 that's what you want to talk about。， You think that me talking about you with you。

 for a long period of time makes me a good conversationalist。， Then fuck， let's do it。， It's crazy。

 You're going to hear people， better you employ this，， unless you talk about yourself。。

 Because here's the thing。 They just don't give a shit。， They just don't care。， They just don't care。

， At best， they'll be mildly impressed， with some cool thing you have going on。。

 You'll be lucky if the people that are close to you in your life。

 give a shit a lot about what you have to say。， That's a topic for another day。。

 To actually build the type of quality people， that you want into your life。， But in reality，。

 even if something's really cool about yourself，， they don't give a shit。。

 It's the whole idea of this，， the entire name of the game of real attraction building。

 is focused not on self-expression， because that's too eccentric。。

 Not on how much value do you possess，， but how much investment can you generate。

 from the other person and the people that are around you， in that group setting？。

 When you focus on how much investment you're able to generate，， that's what real attraction is。。

 When you focus on investment，， you can sexually escalate verbally。

 while still kind of pushing away physically， to the point where we have a lot of attraction equity。。

 Once you have that attraction equity，， you're going to see way crazier。

 into the cares of disinterest。， Way more statements of intent from the girl，。

 from all of her friends。， You're going to be fighting over you。， You add the pre-selection into it。。

 You add all the lifestyle stuff that increases your status。， You don't have to say very many words。。

 You see some of my infields of me demonstrating， this， there's somewhere I say like 10 sentences。

 before the pull，， because I put all these things in place。， I'm not even doing them to expert level。

， I'm just kind of know the framework， and I have has what they're going through my own framework。

 just to show that it's duplicatable to you guys。， It's very simple。。

 Without you having to wait a year or down your journey，， just start doing an investor-based game，。

 start up the logistics，， create amazing epic opportunities， with everybody that you meet，。

 and you're going to find that you're able to achieve， the success you're after。

。
