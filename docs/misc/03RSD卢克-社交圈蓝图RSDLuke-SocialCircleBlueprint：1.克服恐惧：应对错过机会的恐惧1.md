2020年，非常期待以前的功效，非常好� Yin Ferrain，很宅火弥，我的目並非，我因為他為什麼，沒有維持過，我 doom，遇到他，最愛的，我也會，一定要，我在當他，廣告來說，我留於。

Fear missing out high experience game，and extreme adventure based game。

Meaning there was nothing of value，I didn't get a lot of investment from the girl。

and I didn't even really have a lot of self amusement expression，whatever you want to call it。

I just did a lot of cool shit in front of her，and she wanted to be a part of it。

and it got to a point where every day，I was to be honest it was almost to a fault。

I was on a quest to do shit every day，that I've never done before and other people didn't do。

so every single day I was just trying to rage as hard as possible。

 do as cool of activity as possible， now for a lot of guys this is a chore，because we focus on work。

 we focus on， it's like we focus on work， women or entertainment。

 it's kinda like the only things we focus on， work is very centric， it's very categorized。

 with women it's like cold approach， or social networking and whatever it might be。

 whereas I was just focused on having this crazy experience as possible。

 when you have as much crazy experience as possible， as many crazy experiences as possible。

 you'll notice that people want to take you under their wing， so I'll take you under your wing game。

 it's something I talk about a lot， throughout social care blueprint and in all my courses。

 the more you can get people who are already achieving this success， that you want to achieve。

 even if it's somebody that has achieved a lot higher success than you， if you can humble yourself。

 to have them take you under their wing， you're going to achieve a lot of success。

 and you want to do that with the five closest female you bring into your life。

 and the five closest men you have bring into your life。

 but if you can create unique situations with all these people。

 to the point where they have such massive pomeo， for when they're not around you。

 that they want to be around you， that alone can have this type of success。

 you want with women and guys in your life， high status males and attractive women。

 this girl directly resulted in me laying， at least five to ten of the hottest girls that ever fucked in my life。

 in her apartment， and me maturing as a guy， because this was early on in my development。

 and then also gave me my biggest pickup client of all time， that I've ever had， three， four years。

 probably 80 to 120 grand a year of pickup coaching for four years， plus all expenses paid trips。

 in any business that you're in， you can achieve this。

 and the entire way that I was able to make this happen in my life， is fear missing out。

 I created such crazy situations， such unique situations， that she wanted to be a part of it。

 that's a point where she， when I broke up my business partner at the time。

 she basically forced me to move into her， amazing two-bedroom。

 very luxurious and luxurious condo in all of Austin， she forced me to move into it。

 she forced me on all of her girlfriends， using some of the stuff we talk about in the other sections。

 she forced me to have sex with all of her friends， fear missing out。

 you notice the quantity of girls I had been with at the point。

 of me having these anecdotes or examples， and stories I'm sharing with you， was not that many。

 it's not like I was very experienced with women， it's not that I had done 5，000 approaches， 10。

000 approaches， and got these results to happen， that's the biggest thing I want you guys to understand。

 is you don't need to go on this huge journey of self-discovery， of you know， penal this function。

 sorry personal development， you don't have to go on this huge journey。

 you can just get the results you're after the women tonight， tomorrow。

 and then also go on this journey of inner game， self-discovery， penal this。

 sorry personal development， and everything else， well you're achieving all your success。

 it's funny you guys ask me all the time why my confidence is so high， and every day I wake up。

 on one third of the time I wake up on the wrong side of the bed that morning， you know。

 I definitely have times where I'm not having a lot of excitement in my life。

 right away when I wake up I work hard to create that。

 I work aggressively hard to make these things happen。

 with the girls that I just described in Austin， Texas， I purely went for a photo， fear missing out。

 what kind of life could I live where the people who met me were like， holy shit。

 this guy is living a type of life that I've only dreamed of。

 so what's the specific examples of that， the number one specific example is every person I met。

 I want to create a story with that person， so that when they met people who knew me as well。

 they would have some epic story of when they met Luke。

 that was the first key that I realized for this， when you meet people。

 and you have one serious situation that happens with them， you have some epic story。

 you create some situation where you know， you almost treat even as a guy or a girl。

 you almost treat like it's a day too， where every person that you meet that you actually want to bond with and connect with。

 you create a story or situation， with them that they'll tell their grandkids about。

 if you go into every introduction， every person that you meet that way。

 you'll have such a fear missing out， because each person that you meet will think that。

 that's how you live your life every single day， so whether you can maintain that or not。

 a few solid epic stories with certain people， will create this massive buzz around you。

 that will create the you army， I've used it to create the Luke army without me ever trying。

 I accidentally created the Luke army， because I would have such amazing stories with people。

 I originally realized this because I would hear stories of stories。

 from people who had never even known me， but then once they met me， they go oh you're that guy。

 or you're that fucking guy， and I go what do you mean， and they would say oh you're that guy that。

 you know， slid down that wall at the Doseki party， and I go I guess。

 yeah I mean how do you know about that， like oh you know you met my friend John。

 you my friend Jack my friend E， E was my friend at the time he invited me to this。

 he invited me to this， he invited me to this party he was called the Doseki party。

 in Texas every year they rented a Doseki rents on this castle， and they go all this crazy shit。

 and I knew at the time I just knew enough game to basically be dangerous。

 I knew enough breaks and rapport， I knew for traction builders。

 I was like well let me try this stuff out， but I was super shy of being in social situations。

 so what I did was I was like you know what， the only thing I really have going for me at the time is。

 I just want to be as crazy as possible， because I realized that with the more throughput。

 I can shove through the pipe， the better my game is going to be。

 that's what I can do the more crazy situations I can occur。

 the more I'm going to be able to have that feedback loop， of what's happening。

 so Doseki rented out this castle， it is huge event。

 I accidentally had my first foray in a social circle game， because E brought me to this party。

 and he introduced me to all these girls， that he knew that he wasn't having any success with。

 these girls barely even tolerated him， little and liked him。

 but then just off the introduction alone， I got the handshake， the kiss on the cheek。

 the you know I got at least， 15， 20 Facebook closes which at the time was like， all I was going for。

 I definitely closed at least one or two out of those girls， which even looking back。

 that's a pretty good success rate for anybody， one or two closes out of 20。

 interpersonal connections is pretty solid， now that's retarded， now that's terrible。

 but back then I realized， how do I compete with this， it was an event it was a thing happening。

 some of you might have encountered a situation， where you go to a house party， go to a nightclub。

 and you feel like the club is on top of you， or the party is on top of you。

 and say you be on top of the club， an example of that is， let's say you go to an advanced place。

 where very beautiful women are， like a Wilhelmina model， situation or a fashion week。

 what do you do？， well the first step is going to those events， because once you go to them。

 every girl that you approach， is going to be of a girl， who's a lot higher quality。

 than your average girl on a bar， but you have to create a scene。

 the next step is this a creative scene， when you create a scene in these environments。

 you end up creating that story， that we just described。

 it's very difficult to just randomly create a story with somebody， I have a lot of friends。

 a couple of my best friends， well a couple of my best mentors， were there in game and text。

 they made some comments， about a couple of other guys， that I would approach women with。

 and they would say you know I like those people， but you know what you just never create a story with them。

 and I said well that's interesting， what do you mean？， because I have a lot of stories。

 and then they would say well what do you know， what do you mean you have a story with them。

 and I would start describing situations to them， these are two guys who you know。

 one's a hairstylist， one makes suits for guys， and they would tell me these different people。

 that I would be like yeah they crush it， and they go yeah but you know what。

 just there's no boy time， I'm like boy time， that sounds kind of feggy。

 and then they describe the boy time， I was like oh that's actually kind of cool。

 and that results in results of women， but they would tell me they're like yeah。

 there's just no guy time， and you just don't create a story with them。

 and that's the piece that I pulled out， and that I applied with my clients。

 with the past several years， is how do you create stories with people。

 that allows you to meet somebody， in a bar setting， or event setting， or even in the daytime。

 that allows a situation to， to form where you want to connect with people。

 at least 80% of the girls and guys， that I number close， are not coming for me。

 I'm not actually number closing them， I'm not actually aggressively trying。

 to get their phone number， the reason why is， when I create that story that happens。

 I create a situation， that is a fear of a potential fear， missing out occurrence。

 they're just excited to be around me， they want to get my number。

 because they see that there's something， in the future we can do together， I remember I met a guy。

 at Blumartini in Las Vegas， he was the music writer， he wrote all the lyrics。

 and the music for Backstreet Boys， all their songs when they were famous。

 he also was the lead designer， of all the clothing for the Steve Win properties。

 it started with Belagio， it's kind of a funny situation， he built a clothing line。

 after he got you know， had a good amount of net worth built up。

 and after he had a lot of connections， he's also a serious captain， and like the English Air Force。

 very very successful guy， he also owns a big part of the Blumartini franchise。

 he fucks a lot of girls， despite his game， one thing you're going to want to be able to define。

 is a guy that you see having results， despite his game or because of his game。

 this is a guy that had massive results， despite his game， I originally met him。

 because I have a rule， I have a rule which is， you don't have to follow it exactly。

 but I have a rule， which is anytime I see a guy， that any male at any nightclub， or restaurant。

 or any place that I go out to meet people， if I think that he has a higher status。

 net worth pre-selection ability， than me， I immediately offered to buy him a drink。

 and really try to force that drink to happen， and that's because any guy that has a higher income than you。

 or any guy that knows more females than you， if you offered to buy him that drink。

 within four weeks， that's going to turn around and do massive things for you， I was just with。

 even in this venue right here， I was just with， you know。

 the concierge of the Vegas Immersion program， and we， as you just walked in right。

 I was just with him， and you know， I ordered a couple of drinks for some friends of ours， and very。

 very quickly， we were interrupted， with the conversation that we were having。

 and even though I give him my card， the bartender pushes the card away， and says no no。

 it's not good here， it's not good here， and it's funny， because the only thing that I did。

 I don't even remember the guy， I don't even， I've never recognized his face。

 and we'll get more into this， and we'll get more into this in， you know the module we talk about。

 how to save money， and even make money， with a sociable game， but I don't even remember this guy。

 I have no idea who he is， I literally have to beg him， to run one dollar on the card。

 so I can tip him over， rather than just walking out， without paying him anything， I feel bad。

 there's no， I don't have cash on me， what I even do in this situation。

 and the only reason why he did that， is because， he has heard stories， of the situations。

 that I have occurred， and created in other people's lives， he's heard the stories， he said hey that。

 you know that， that chubby white dude， with the long hair， he's a fucking nut job。

 but in a good way， in a funny way， that's the only reason why he did it， I don't even remember。

 meeting him， but the situation， me creating a story， in his mind， creates such fear。

 missing out that， even if we never hang out， in the future， there's something in his mind。

 of hey you know what， this is a guy， that I want to hang out with， even if it doesn't even happen。

 I just want to add value， in whatever way I can， you can almost take this too far。

 you can take this， in a situation， where you can just take value from people。

 because they're so excited to be around your energy， or your presence， that you。

 that's hard to add value back， that can be a negative occurrence， but it's a good litmus test。

 it's your litmus test to wake up in the morning， tomorrow wake up。

 and I want you to look at your phone， how many invites the things you have， cool guys。

 or average guys， Jill Lunchbox， attractive girls， any girls， are you waking up。

 with a bunch of phone numbers， do you have to come up with， ways to message them。

 or are you having to， respond back to people， who are begging to hang out with you。

 every day I wake up， I've been in game now for over 8 years， I've talked game for， for 70 years。

 every day I wake up， for the past 6 and a half， 7 years， it's just more and more messages of。

 how do I respond back， to this person， for this cool thing that I have to do。

 whether it's work related， pussy related， so here's the thing， when you can create such fear。

 missing out in people's lives， within days， hours， minutes， seconds， of meeting them。

 how do you think they're going to， respond when they hear about you。

 when they think about you in their mind， within 5 seconds of meeting somebody。

 they're getting my phone number， and asking me to come to some event， that they have going on。

 without me adding value， without me actually trying to， could pro quo， insight any sort of value。

 into their life， or any sort of introductions， the first step in creating a situation。

 where you create stories， with other people， is creating a scene， the best way to create a scene。

 is to realize， that calibration is the most， overrated game concept， in all of the time。

 calibration is useless， the more calibrated you are， the more in tune you are。

 with your inner weirdo， I never once want to be calibrated， I don't want to be congruent， at all。

 once I feel calibrated， and congruent， you know what I feel， it's comfortable。

 do you know when you feel， perfectly congruent， you actually feel very comfortable。

 you feel at ease， causing the scene， means a lot of different things， it's very vague and verbose。

 at first， I cause a scene， whether I'm in a， business boardroom meeting， with VCs， Fitcher Capillus。

 or while I'm with my， closest friends， and we're talking about， archer jokes， of dead baby jokes。

 just the most， we're in a Korean barbecue， and I'm trying to make out， and fondle， and get the girl。

 that jerked me off into the table， that's like the old Korean woman， and she ends up thinking。

 it's so hysterical， that she ends up making out， with me bringing me into the kitchen， and I'm like。

 making my own Korean barbecue food， I don't know how to cook， raw man noodles for myself。

 a little Korean barbecue， and she just thinks， it's hilarious， and it ends up getting。

 to my students'， laid， I get to make out， with some crazy old lady， and every time I go there。

 it's half off the food， purely because of fear， missing out， every time I go there。

 she asks one thing， which is， where have you been， where have you been， and I caused a scene。

 now that's something， you have to understand， is breaking out of the norm， being full-on crazy。

 is something that， as long as it's very clear， that's who you are， the world is not a。

 nine to five place， the world is not a place， that will contain， somebody who's willing。

 to be that crazy， and cause a scene， I created a situation， where I made a lot of money。

 in my personal life， and helped some of my clients， achieve some of the best results。

 they've ever had， and got some epic video， and you know， and you know， discount on food。

 which is always kind of cool， right as a guy， and all from a， two-hour， sake-fueled， crazy。

 cold sake-fueled， situation， where I acted， a fool， where I acted completely， beyond what would be。

 in my normal， congruent self， the thing is， I was okay with it， if I was somebody， who was shy。

 or insecure， or nervous about acting， like that， it would have never happened， my students。

 would not have gotten， laid， I would have never gotten， the further contract。

 it would have never happened， but most people， think that they don't， cause a scene。

 they don't want to cause a， stir， what I'm here to tell you is， causing the stir。

 is exactly what makes， you the center of the group， instead of looking， outside the group， inward。

 as if you want to be a part of it， everybody wants to play it safe， they want to play the。

 wallflower， because why they don't， cause a scene， they don't want to， stir the pot， me and my。

 closest wing in the world， we have this thing， where we just， kind of mess it up。

 because it kind of looks， like this，我們也過了，同 범的道路，好 瞩瞩，我們都是那些，我們在乎不同的，小 part，和同重的， vous ideas，假設，階段。
