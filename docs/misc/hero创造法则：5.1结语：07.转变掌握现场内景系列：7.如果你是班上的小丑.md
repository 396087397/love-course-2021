# hero创造法则：5.1结语：07.转变掌握现场内景系列：7.如果你是班上的小丑

所以， another front that people put on， another way of coping， which is extremely common。

 is the class clown。， You know， it's that person who's kind of cocky。

 trying to be too cool for school。， You know， it's that person who， if I'm giving a seminar。

 they're in the audience， and they're always raising their hand， like， pick me， pick me。。

 They laugh really loud， they talk really loud with the people around them， trying to be noticed。

 trying to look confident， if they come up and say，， say， hi， it's like， hey， Julian， you know。

 just trying a little too hard， and you use sense， it's not authentic。， It's not genuine confidence。

 It's coming from a place of compensation， you know， similar to someone who's always positive，。

 just always happy。 You sense it's not genuine positivity。 It's compensating。

 running away from happy negative。， Here， it's like running away from not being good enough。

 and you still need that approval。， You know， it's still weak。 You're doing it to get approval。 It's。

 sit where to a people pleaser。， You know， the people pleaser is always like， oh， yes， you go first。

 Yes， trying to get approval。 Here， it's me first。， Fuck yeah。 Also trying to get approval。

 And it's a front that you have to get rid of。， You're excited。 Come on， I've come on。 I've come on。。

 Have a seat。 Have a seat。， So， let's go in on with you。， Well， it's simple and it's complicated。。

 Okay。， Yeah， I'm pretty much， I can hear my ears， my heart， my kind of legiva shit。， But anyways。

 I feel insecure， and that is my biggest issue。， Yeah。 And I know that it's a biggest issue。。

 And sometimes I don't give a shit， but a lot of times I do。， What are you insecure about？， Melux。。

 Okay， what about him？， I don't know。 I just try to be precise here。 This is where， again。

 similar to her introspection times。， Well， my nose。， Okay。， What else？， That's it。， To your nose。。

 That up。， Okay。 So with him， you can kind of sense that front。， You know。

 it's like a little too tri-hard。 You'd think he'd be confident because he's like， pick me， pick me。。

 All excited。 He comes up up front， able to talk， kind of like， do-do-do-do-do。。

 Like making little jokes。 You'd think， oh man， that guy's really comfortable with himself。， But no。。

 It's coming from a place of compensation。 You can sense the tri-hardness behind it。。

 There's not that authentic connection to him at this point。， And with this first example。

 I also want you to realize that the first step to diving into it is there needs to be a willingness to go deep。

， Okay。 With resistance， you're not going to go far if you don't have that willingness to sink into it。

， Here， it's like， well， your nose。 Okay， why？ I don't know。 That's it。， You know。

 there's not that willingness to really get to the source， get to the cause。

 And that's like the first step。， So， were you ever mocked for your nose？， Of course。， Okay。。

 Describe some of those incidences。， I was back 10 years ago。， Oh。， I don't know。 I didn't really。。。

 I just kind of pushed it aside。 I mean， it's with me， whatever。， So I just， you know。

 I'm going my way。 And that's it。， Let's just describe one of the times people just really mocked you。

， So here， I'm trying to bring up more sensations。 I'm having him recall different moments where maybe he was mocked about his nose。

， And again， the nose is just the surface thing。 You've got to go way fucking deeper。

 It's not the nose。， But I want more sensations for him to kind of tune into those and then start diving deep。

， But you can still see that resistance come up where it's like， you know what？

 I just kind of push it aside and that's it。， I want one example。

 I want you to describe it in an extreme detail。， What happened？ What they said？， What you felt？。

 You're from。。。 where's this guy？， I was sitting on it。， Yeah， anyways。 Yeah， there he is。， Yeah。

 he was just like。。。 up in my face。， We have this pickup improv where we just try to speak for a few minutes with everybody talking at you。

， Yeah， good。， And he just came up to me on my side。， Like， nose。， He knows that。， I respect him。。

 I don't get hurt by him saying that。， I just find it interesting。， So he didn't really hurt me that。

， You can also sense here that he was hurt by that。， Like。

 he wouldn't be qualifying and justifying it so much。， Like， oh， it wasn't hurt， you know？ Like。

 poor， it didn't do anything， you know？， There's that defensiveness。。

 When was one of the earlier memories of people mocking you for your nose？， Um。。。。

 That was a long time ago。， Like， completely。。。， Or one that hurt the most。。

 Turn that really honestly。， I'm just putting shit on myself。。

 And this is really how this class clown， too cool for school，， type of fronts will fuck you over。。

 Okay， not only is it fake， not only is it rooted in fear， it's a form of coping，。

 but it will also block you from going deeper into what it is you fear。， Because right now， you know。

 he comes up。， He's like， ah， yeah， you know my nose。。

 And as I keep directing him to go deeper and deeper and kind of blast through that resistance。。

 Like， no， it did hurt。， But let's dive into that。， Suddenly， if he dies into it。

 it kills that front。， Because you can't be too cool if you admit that you were hurt。。

 So it blocks you from being honest with yourself。。

 It blocks you from really introspecting and following that trail of wise。。

 And this is why he tries to back out。， And I was like， oh， it didn't hurt。， You know what？。

 It's really not that bad。， I was just putting shit on myself。， I'm never mind， you know。

 trying to talk his way out of it。， Which obviously， I'm like， ah， ah， we keep going here。。

 Now there was one that really hurt。， What is it？， Well， I don't know。， It's a commulation。。

 So there's no risk。， Pick one。， This is all just you trying to avoid it now。， You're like， listen。

 it's my nose。， And you're like， oh， actually， no， never mind。， You know what？， No。

 we're going into this。， Like， when's one of really people mocked you？， And you felt really hurt。。

 Or one time， even if you dive into insecurity，， it's like when people really just mocked you。。

 And you told yourself， man， you know， it's not okay for you。， Like， maybe I'm not good enough。。

 Maybe， you know， there's these things that are just wrong with me。， What's wrong with you？。

 When sometimes you really felt just rejected and mocked and disapproved of。。

 Can you repeat the question？， What's one time you just felt mocked， disapproved of，。

 even if it's subtle， like one that just kind of pops up。， Because I know one does pop up。， Sure。。

 The one in school。， It's just like chilling out。， And I felt down and I went down。。

 I specifically don't like myself。， And then like somebody mentioned it。， And I was just like， yeah。

 whatever。， I just don't make phone。， How do you feel when you look at yourself in the mirror？， Well。

 like， I don't know。， It's complicated。， Well， that's what we're going to keep diving into。。

 We're not moving forward till we dive into this。， Sometimes I just feel like， fuck yeah。

 I don't fucking give a shit。， And I go through my day and I have an awesome day without。

 we're zero thoughts about it。， Let's go in on one of the days where you don't feel like fuck yeah。。

 Or when you see yourself in a picture and you're like，， fuck， I'm so ugly。， Fuck my nose。。

 Why do I have this nose？， Why do I look so fucking ugly？， So what I'm doing here，。

 similar to one of the previous examples where I'm like，。

 why are you such a piece of shit trying to bring shit up？， Here， I'm doing the same thing。。

 I'm like， when you look at yourself and you're like，， fuck， I'm so ugly。。

 Fuck my nose trying to bring those sensations up，， trying to trigger something。。

 And you still see that resistance kick in here。， You know， it's like， well， why？， It's complicated。。

 Another form of， I don't know。， Staying on the surface as opposed to going deep。。

 And even when I tell them， well，， let's keep diving into it。。

 We're not going to keep on going here until we dive into it。， He's like， well， a lot of times。

 you know，， I look in the mirror and I feel really good。， You know， well。

 what about the times you don't feel good？， He just keeps trying to avoid that。， And again。

 it's not him。， It's not like， well， fuck this guy。， Why is he going deeper？， We all have it。。

 This is resistance。， This is how it will manifest。， Because we all have it where sometimes like，。

 you just， you know， fuck， man，， I mean， everyone has this。， I usually have this where I'm like，。

 going about my day， I feel fucking awesome。， And usually this will happen when you go into like a changing room。

， Like you go to try a new clothes。， And sometimes it's like the 360 mirrors and the lighting。。

 And it's like you're like，， that's what I look like。， Like that。。

 Because I don't find myself looking ugly or whatever，， like 360 degrees。， What about your nose？。

 Sometimes， sometimes。， Sometimes I will give a shit，， but sometimes it's part of me。， And like。

 there's not much thing I can do about it。， So just， I should like deal with it，。

 but it does not much deal with it。， But I don't know。， It's constantly coming。， It comes and goes。。

 So that's basically it。， Okay， so what I will say with you is like，， one。

 it's like gig clear on what it is， and start being more honest with yourself。。

 Because this is something we'll do。， It's like， okay， I'm insecure about my nose。， But actually。

 it's not my nose。， But it could be this。， But， you know what？， Actually， it's not this。， It's like。

 you just keep escaping it，， versus allowing yourself to actually sink into that feeling。。

 And this is big， by the way。， It's like a lot of that stuff that you feel really，。

 like you've suppressed。， It's covered with layers and layers and layers and layers of resistance。。

 And every time you'll start diving into it，， like， there'll be many ways，， like。

 start being aware of them，， that you'll escape it。， You know， it's like。

 you'll sit down and maybe do this，， or you'll kind of dive into， okay， what's going on。， And then。

 you may get a little tired of bored。， Who has that when they start meditating？， You're like。

 you know what？， You're like， you're going to be over this。， Yeah。， Another one is like。

 when you start maybe reading a book，， you're like， oh， I'm tired。， Like。

 that's an escape mechanism kind of feeling tired。， Oh， maybe I'll nap。， I'll do it later。。

 I'm too tired for this right now。， We all have that。， Jumping from distraction。， Like， ah。

 this is too boring。， Rationalizing。， Or， oh， you know what？， I'm okay。， Oh， it wasn't that。。

 It was like the easiest resistance。， It's over。， I was wrong。， Actually。

 I'm not insecure about that。， I was， but nah， I don't want to deal with it。， I'm getting it。。

 You know？， Or like， just going around on this circle， and then， you know。

 you're going to be able to see， what kind of resistance is。， So， you know， the most common one is，。

 let's just say fear of rejection， which we all have。， Why are you afraid of being rejected？。

 Because I don't want to be rejected。， Why？， You know， because I'll feel bad。， Why？， Just because。。

 So， you just kind of stand on the surface，， versus going deep。， So， it's kind of here。， It's like。

 you're just staying on the surface。， It's like， going deep into a spectrum。， What is there to find？。

 There's another form of resistance。， What's the point？， But what's there to find？， What's the point？

， What is it？， Yeah。， I don't know。， Or I just refuse to know。， Well， you know， it's like， honestly。

 inside of you。， Like， you truly denoted in care。， You and have raised your hand。， No， actually。

 the reason for me raising hand， is because I have this heart， not the problem，， but like， whatever。

 see opportunity。， And I'm in tune with my heart。， My heart starts beating up。。

 I have to do it no matter what。， So， or what？， What if you don't do it？， Well， I'm just like， my。

 it's like craving。， It's a form of craving。， Does that sound like scarcity or abundance？。

 It's a scarcity。， It's scarcity， but I don't see full scarcity。， Like， I see just， like， how many。。。

， How do you。。。， How do you。。。， I'd say your same boy has stopped lying to yourself。。

 I'm doing my best I can to。。。， Of course。， You know， again， it's like。。。， I mean。

 most likely what you're saying is true，， and it's like it does make sense。， And again。

 I don't know you， but just for my general vibe，， that I can kind of pick up on。， And I mean。

 let me know if you guys kind of feel the same。， It's like， you kind of feel justification， defense，。

 just kind of going around。， Like， I don't feel like similar to when she was narrating。

 what's going on， like， we had that glimpse of like authenticity。。

 I don't connect with you authentically right now。， I'm not talking to the real you。。

 I'm talking to the little front that's trying to be cool， and funny being up here。。

 That's like 95% of me， but 5% is someone。。。， Plus， I don't know if it's。。。， Like。

 if we talk to right now and like， say we just vibed，， I wouldn't connect with you as a person。。

 I wouldn't get to know you and probably I wouldn't be inspired， to like， hang out again。， Like。

 you're not someone that I would like to hang out with。， Well。

 that's because I'm not talking about what I want to talk about。， You can justify it。。

 You can go to your defense mechanism right now， that you've been doing this entire time。。

 Or you can allow yourself to think in why。， Or you can keep turning a service，， oh， well。

 it's because of this。， Oh， well， no， no， no， it's because of this。， We're singing to why。。

 So what I'm doing here by saying all of these harsh things。

 is I'm taking away the possibility of him maintaining this front。。

 I'm taking away his coping mechanism。， I'm making it more unacceptable， if you will，。

 to keep that too cool for school kind of class clown front going，， then being real。。

 It's more unacceptable to keep this front on now。， Because I'm like， this front。

 I don't connect with it。， Like， I wouldn't even hang out with you in person。， Oh， shit。。

 So I rob him of his defense mechanism， and then he's now forced to bring out a little bit of authenticity。

， And even if it's like hurt， it doesn't matter。， Because what he needs is a reminder of what it's like to finally be real again。

， And you'll see it a little bit comes out here。， And you'll most likely connect with him more than you did up until now。

， You see the human side of him versus the fake surface level front。， Specific， like， moment。。

 What it really， like， sticked into me。， I was with my father。， When I was like。

 just got my braces and I got my tooth，， so it was like， who's weird。。

 And I was just like laughing hysterically with my parents。， And my father just gave me the blick，。

 like， don't laugh in front of a girl like that。， How did that feel？， Oh， that feels like。。。。

 Describe it。， Like an alien coffin。， Break it up。， Let's go even deeper， like。

 really replay it right now。， Like you're sitting here and your dad's like，。

 just completely disapproved of。， Disappointment。， So how would it feel right now？。

 It's like your parents just disappointed。， How do it feel right now？， Like。

 experience like your dad's disappointment。， Well， right now， I care less。， Do you？。

 Or are you just telling yourself you carry us？， Running away from it。， So a little bit comes up。。

 You know， he starts letting some authenticity in，， and then like， well， let's go even deeper here。。

 It's like， well， you know now， I care less。， So there's still that resistance to go deeper。， Okay。

 it'll try to get you at every fucking turn。， How did it feel when I told you。

 like I wouldn't want to hang out with you？， Which is completely honest， by the way。。

 How did that feel？， And I know it's easy to laugh at it。， Like， that's an easy escape。， Like。

 how did that honestly feel？， Like， most likely if you hear it， you've watched a lot of my videos。。

 Like， being modest， I'm assuming like，， because I did the same。， It's like。

 and I still did the same。， Like， you'd look up to me。， And here I am， and I'm telling you，。

 I wouldn't want to hang out with you。， It felt kind of like， like， like，， like， like， lash at me。

 like， my ego or whatever。， But， you know， it's， they go on。， They go on。， They go on。。

 And I'll still do what I'm doing。， And it's just a vacation。， Okay。， I tried to amp it up some more。

， Like， how did it feel when I said， I didn't want to hang out with you？。

 Just really trying to spark it up。， And here again， like， resistance takes over。， It's like， well。

 you know what？， It kind of hurt my ego。， But hey， do these go on？， You know。

 I'll still do what I do。， It's like， there has to be that within this。， Like。

 you need to really smash that front。， And this is something that takes time。， Okay。， This is him。。

 Like， he's going to have to sit down and really go through the process。

 of releasing all of this resistance。， But there was a little bit of a crack。。

 And it really brings for him that awareness around， how much he's resisting this。， You know。

 until someone points out， like， look at this shit。， Look at this shit。， Look at this shit。。

 You just keep lying to yourself and just staying in this fucking loop。， Now， is that escaping？。

 Is that changing the topic to escape？， Yes。， Okay。， Here's my take。。

 Is that it did actually affect you。， And it kind of finally opens you up to actually bring。

 something a little bit more authentic out。， Okay。， And again， maybe not necessarily 100%。。

 But fuck it。， It's like a hell of a lot better than before。， You， and tell me if you agree。。

 Opening up， say about your dad and stuff。， Made you way more relatable and more human than anything before that。

， And way more likable as a person。， Before that， we're just talking with the front。， He's like， oh。

 I like justifying running away from。， There's not the glimpse like that realness。， You know？。

 And I can guarantee you， by the way，， if you want to link this to just general social interactions。。

 Like， the more you can bring this out，， people will like connect way faster。， And guess what？。

 You're going to bring that out of them。， And in today's society，。

 it's like we're just fronts interacting with fronts。， It's insane。， Bring this out。。

 See that in the other person。， Bring it out of them。， That's。

 you have like those authentic interactions。， And if you even want to link it to success with women，。

 that's when people fucking love you。， It's like when you can see past that front。。

 And when you get out of your own way too。， Again， we always underestimate the value of authenticity。

， We always do。， We always think it's like it's so bad to be authentic。， It's so bad to let this up。。

 It's so bad for this。， I must do this。， I must do that。， I must do that。。

 There's nothing you must do。， Just bring it up。， You know？， So for you。

 what I'd recommend doing is one。， Being honest with yourself。。

 Start catching yourself every time you actually lie。， It's like you'll know。， I mean。

 even if you hear of my old，， you guys are here， the old gun to the head。， It's like， we're all like。

， oh， you know， I don't think this。， If someone put a gun to your head，， it's like， tell the truth。。

 What's the first thing that pops in？， That's the truth。， So if a friend， you're like， oh， you know，。

 what's the truth？， You know， if you're like， that's up to you。， It's like， be honest there。。

 And then it's changed that habit。， Because it's very subtle of like，。

 quickly moving on to the next thing。， If something hurts， I'm a man。， I'll just move on。。

 I'll just deal with it。， There's nothing I can do。， I'll just deal with it。， What should you like？。

 What happens to， what's so bad if you experience it？， What's so bad if you feel hurt？， Well。

 there is。， Because you change it。， Good。， It is because you change it。。

 You don't allow yourself to feel hurt。， So again， it's really like catching the habit here。

 of resistance， start being aware of it，， and then just really doing that process。

 and letting go of it。， And I mean， really having that willingness of going deeper。。

 That's like the worst part of having this kind of， class clown too cool for schoolfront。

 is it blocks you from really doing the work。， For you， the only reason I'd bring you up， by the way。

， is to kind of contrast it where， you're still in your head a little bit。。

 It's not like the opposite route。， It's like most people， as I said before，。

 they'll kind of stay down here。， You've optimized a lot， but you're still hiding。。

 Not in front of the shy front。， It's been in front of the try-hard front。， Yeah。

 the fact you're not even listening， what I'm saying is another sign of that。， But come on up。

 come on up。， Bring your chair or someone like grab a chair。， Bring your chair。， Yeah。。

 Now the fact you're not listening to that either。， Bring your chair。， We go two routes。。

 We either retreat or we overcompensate。， Both are authentic。， Again， you're either like，。

 I'm very quiet or I'm very loud， but forceful。， You're on the more， I'm cool， ha ha ha。。

 You'll see a lot of that in terms of a school， like class clowns。， Like there's like， oh。

 I was joking，， but it's like never really authentic as a little bit forced。。

 Or the guy's like super shy。， Compare it to success with women。， You get the super nice guy people。

 please， er。， You a little bit less。， You do this a little bit of that。。

 What kind of view from what I've seen。， And then there's the more of like，， oh。

 let's compensate by being an asshole， a bad boy。， You're so， by the way。

 I know that guy for four or five years。， Showing points。， On point？， Yeah。， I know。， I know。。

 So how are you doing？， That's not a pretty good one。， I feel happy。， Yeah。， I can know， no no no。。

 You're a lot more quieter than when you're over there。， When you're over there？， Eh？， No， no。。

 I didn't like two sides。， So one side is all the social function。， Like I've finished like。

 you don't have to qualify yourself。， I'm not doing that。， It's cool。， Okay。。

 So I'm slowly starting to strip away the possibility of him。

 still escaping by putting on this front。， You know， it's like， hey。

 you don't have to qualify yourself。， Stop trying to be so cool。。

 Now it's no longer possible to be cool。， Like being cool is no longer acceptable anymore。。

 So just stripping away the front a bit， stripping away that possibility of him coping，。

 getting to that authenticity。， One side is saying like， what are you afraid of right now？。

 What are you afraid of people seeing？， I was explaining that。， Tell me right now。。

 What are you afraid of？， There's still one force you're meant like， all you have to do，。

 you have to speak louder， you have to act like you'll do something。， But there's another thing like。

 all you do is do anything like that。， You know， but it's too size fit。。

 One side is I can just talk and have my listens。， Right now。， One side is， oh。

 my force not loud enough or has to do something after force。， Great exercise。。

 It doesn't get to the cause， but it's a stepping stone there。， If you're someone who's like。

 always has this front，， it's just to start verbalizing your thought process。。

 So you kind of did that now， but let's just do it now。。

 Whatever's going through your head right now， just don't judge it， express it。， Go。。

 Like literally right now， even me saying that，， what's the first thing that goes your mind verbalized it。

 express it，， and keep on talking like a minute like that。， Now， don't distract him。， Because again。

 you probably like have that same class clown type thing。， So if I was the teacher。

 I'd put you in the corner。， But go。， Is this free flow？， Well， I have to pitch before。， No。

 because now you're talking about a story。， I want what actually is going in right now。。

 What's going on right now is just free flow。， So you should be telling me， so I'm thinking。

 should I just free flow？， I'm kind of confused right now as to what I should do。。

 Present moment with the fucks going on in your mind verbalize it。， It's not a story right now。。

 I don't know if we left thoughts for a hand。， I'm just sitting and I'm just looking at me。。

 Just like， what should I do for a stay？， You're a stay。， You're trying to think， but you know。

 thinking。， Be honest， you're staying on the topic of people。， It's not off good。。

 I don't really know what to say。， But then you kind of got in that story。。

 People are staring and laughing。， What's going on actually？， What are the actual emotions， thoughts。

 feelings， sensations？， I just feel just pressure。， But in one end， it's pressureing and like。

 oh fuck。， On that， it's pressure is like， okay， I can handle it。， It doesn't， you know。

 it's the force shit。， And actually， I don't know。， I don't know。， But yeah。。

 You're going for it to be happy actually。， Like， I wanted to have this social pressure。。

 I don't know why， but I needed it kind of。， Why are you guys listening？， Why？， Go look。。

 I'll say a few things。， Are you tired of all the effort？， Yes。， Even now？， Yeah。。

 I feel tired of myself。， I'm tired of it。， I made a video about it like when you're kind of the intense video。

， Fuck the video， you're changed。， Like， let's just focus on this。， Okay。， Which by the way， again。

 like this front，， I would never be able to connect with it。， Like， if we had a hangout in person，。

 you're the person I would never hang out with。， Like， full honest。。

 I would just not want you near me，， because I send zero authenticity。， Bang！。

 So you see a bit of a crack here。， A crack about authenticity。， Even if it's hurt。， Again。

 this is what's actually going on。， It's like， fuck the front。， Like， let realness out。。

 And once again， what I'm doing here， is I'm taking away that coping mechanism。。

 I just start devalitating that front。， Adol。， Adol。， Like， I would not even talk to you。， Like。

 even now I kind of feel disgust， having you here on stage。， I'm full of serious。， Like。

 don't even laugh。， I'm serious。， How does that make you feel right now？。

 So I amplify it even more here。， And you see a last sign of escape， is a more he tries to laugh。。

 Like， ha， ha。， Like， you know， it's a joke。， Like， anything to still try to preserve that。。

 I'm cool， friends。， And of course， I call him out for that。， I'm like， don't laugh。， Like。

 you feel like laughing here。， How does this really make you feel？， Okay。

 it's really taking away all possibilities of coping，， all possibilities of maintaining that front。

 until you're only left with authenticity。， Like， just being rejected in a full honest way。。

 Don't smile or compensate for it。， How does it make you feel？， Be honest。， Put it out there。。

 No front。， No jokes。， Do you feel like smiling when you hear something like that？， No。

 I'm not even kidding。， Like， do you feel like smiling？， No。， Let out what， like。

 express the thought emotion， when I'm saying this。， Because if someone was saying this to me，。

 I'd be a little pissed and I'd be a little hurt。， I feel crying actually。， Okay。。

 So why are you holding it in？， What's so bad if you let out some crying？， Because crying。

 guess what？， Same fucking thing as laughter。， One's the positive side。， You suppress。。

 The other's the label we place on the negative side。， You suppress。， What if you cry？。

 What's so bad about that？， Would it ruin your image of being cool， and being funny and being cocky？。

 Fuck that image。， That's what I'm asking you to do。， It's like， ruin that image。。

 And that's what everyone is hoping to see。， And that's what I'm hoping to see through。， It's like。

 inside， you are authentic。， And if you could bring that out yet，。

 everything outside this room is against you， by the way。， It's like， don't bring that out。， Like。

 keep this fucking front on。， But if you could bring that out，， that's the thing I'd connect with。。

 That's what I want to see。， And when I'm saying I'm disgusted with you，。

 it's not you as a person's this fucking front。， The you as a person is like，。

 it's not you as a person's this fucking front。， The you have on and that we all have on。。

 I want to see authenticity。， And I can guarantee you now， even before when I said that，。

 if you allowed yourself to cry or even express that emotion，， it doesn't even cry。， Like。

 to actually experience it versus，， I'm a man， I'm going to stuff it down。， I'm in front of a crowd。。

 No one can see this。， No tears here。， Just laughter。， If you could let that out，。

 everyone would fucking love you a million times more。， Because that's where everyone's after。。

 That authenticity。， That's where we're all after。， And again， it's so crazy。， It's like。

 we try so hard to be cool，， to be right all the time。， When in reality， that's not what we're after。

， You know， people would approve of you way more， if you were just more authentic。， You know。

 that's what we're all missing inside of us。， That's what we're all looking for outside of us。。

 It's like we're all disconnected from being authentic。， And it's what we're after。， I mean。

 that's the fucking goal。， You know， stop trying to be right all the time。。

 Stop trying to be cool all the time。， Try letting a bit of fucking realness out。。

 And you'll be surprised by the result。， Now， are you going to stay with that authentic reaction。

 of you feeling hurt？， Are you going to be with yourself？。

 Or are you going to tell that authentic you inside who's hurt？， Shut the fuck up。。

 Are you going to abandon yourself？， Or are you going to be with yourself？。

 That's what you got to ask yourself。， Because this is the same as people pleasing。。

 We abandon ourselves。， There's that little voice。， Maybe a friend asks you， do you want to do this？。

 You want to say no？， You're like， yes， to please。， Here， you want to feel hurt authentically。。

 But then you're like， shut the fuck up。， You're cool in front of the crowd。。

 And you're abandoning yourself。， And you're killing yourself a steam time after time after time。。

 You want to grow self-esteem？， Stay true to yourself。， Now， it could not be crying anymore。。

 But what's the impulse inside？， Right now。， I want to cry。， I want to cry。， We'll also verbalize it。

， So， there's a fight。， A fight？ Good？， Like， cry。， Love cry。， Love cry。， That's it。。

 What would be so scary about letting loose and cry？， And you can just sense it。。

 It's a lot more authentic now。， And it's funny to you how you mentioned it。。

 There's that fight inside。， That's your ego just still fighting for survival。。

 It's that front fighting for survival。， It's like， let out a bit of realness。， No， no， no。。

 Can you still preserve it？， Anything to preserve it？， Don't let the front die。。

 You know what I said？， It's like you've got to kill the ego。， You have to kill that front。。

 You have to let go of that resistance to maintaining that front。。

 That resistance to being authentic。， Did you have any other experiences recently。

 where there's that same type of fight？， That whole day。， Today？， The whole day。。

 So is that a constant battle？， What would be so bad about like stop fighting internally for a bit？。

 What if just right now，， 30 seconds just stop fighting just gave in？。

 You think you'd fall into scarcity？， So give in。， Just be with it。。

 You don't have to even express it， just be with it。， Don't shove it down。， Whether it's crying。

 whether it's being mad，， it should probably be a bit of the two。， You would like hurt， cry， mad。

 maybe embarrassed，， maybe pissed， be non-spot， whatever it is。。

 This is like the step one of like just like you want to build an authentic self-esteem。。

 You want to start accepting yourself and not suppressing that shit or subconscious。。

 It all starts here。， You keep abandoning yourself。， And this is just one example。， But yeah。

 there's always going to be that part of you。， It's like， you don't love you。， Keep abandoning you。。

 Why don't you stand by you？， And I can guarantee you like no one wants to see you be cool or not cool。

， They want to see realness。， We're in this world just fucking grasping for realness。。

 So just now give yourself like five seconds， ten seconds of realness。， Whatever it is。

 just you don't have to talk。， Just breathe into it。， Just be with it。。

 And that also means like be with the emotion。， Don't escape to your head。。

 Because that's another thing we do。， You feel like shit。， It's very easy to shove it down。。

 Or to just run in your head。， If I come in my head， I'm not really feeling it。， I'm thinking now。。

 I'm logical now。， Like fully breathe into it。， If there's resistance around it，。

 breathe into that feeling of resistance。， Okay。， Now this is the process。， I felt it even right now。

， And the crap can correct me if I'm wrong。， But you actually now trying to be with that resistance。

 was the most authentic we've seen you。， And it's this face right here where you kind of like，。

 that's what people want to see。， And it's not the funny front。， I can guarantee you like，。

 I connect with you now more。， And don't even worry about me like，， like。

 I can guarantee you that your love and respect， you are not the only person that wants to see you。。

 You know， if you don't want to see it，， you're not the only one who wants to see it。。

 But if you're the only one who wants to see you，，我每次都，用你的力量，我是对 Give a Shit，妳看我，如果感觉有的时候。

受不了，而且，啊，你 know， and of course it's like， for you it will be like kind of processing。

 and staying with that resistance first， until you like break through and then most likely。

 kind of from this example here， there's probably a lot of hurt that will come up， and that's fine。

 and you have to allow yourself to actually go through that。

 because once it's there and you realize like it's all good。

 now there's one thing less to run away from， now when you're actually sitting at home with yourself。

 you don't have to escape your thoughts， you don't have to jump on mine watch a video。

 or you don't have to always have that compulsiveness to， you know be like the laughing jokester。

 now there's nothing wrong with being the laughing jokester， as long as you're inspired to do it。

 you're like I'm fucking awesome yeah， let's joke around， versus I feel horrible。

 let's joke to run away from the feeling horrible， you know， it's better than nothing。

 if you're someone who's like I feel horrible， oh I hate myself， then yeah joking is better。

 but then you need to come back and get to the cause， okay does that make sense。

 and again stand up I'll give you a little gay bromance hug here， respect and respect。

 I like honestly， please stop， applause， and I can guarantee you。

 this here like if you remember this and you take it with you， like that's what you need， you know。

 and it's funny enough to there's always what you need and what you want。

 like coming up here this is not what you wanted， at all。

 but like this is what it means like really you know， getting to the cause of shit。

 I mean what an amazing you know experience here an amazing reference to have。

 and then of course it's having him sit down here and， whew。

 let go of those sensations do the process。
