地区与这个厕商 regian 刘涉，不可能，电脑下子，在整个形式之内，C1C2C3，C2C3， Wherever，I like having them sit next to me，Right。

I'll take their hand， Put on my knee， Let go，I put their hand on my knee， And I let go。

 Because I look cooler that way， If they pull their hand away， Fine， I shut up。

 And they get negative body language， For a little bit， Then of course they re-initiate the chat。

 I'll be like， Hmm， And I continue again， It's so obvious， And it's a fun game， And it works。

 This has been evolved out of the game， You know， So all these things you have to have the guts to do。

 There is a hand holding， Right， Arm and arm， What else did you see me do？， Sit on the lap。

 Sit on lap， And that could be the TV test， Hand holding could be the keynote test。

 Can allow you to do that， We can also say just holding， How about embrace。

 Like I did with that girl， Right， Smelling， You smell so fucking good， Or you smell so familiar。

 Isn't that good one？， I'm so pleased with that， I'm going to use that tonight。

 You smell so familiar， That's almost too smooth， Smelling， Fighting， Fighting here， This is a。

 Style's evolution phase shift， Where you can read it online， It's not my routine。

 It's on the lounge， And basically the way it goes as you say to the girl， You notice how。

 The outside of all your joints， Have very few nerves， But the insides have like a very tender。

 And have lots of nerves， Like the outside here， You can grab here， And it's very hard。

 Here it's really tender， And you touch her here， It's really tender， And out here。

 See how it's like really tough skin， Like Kentucky fried chicken。

 So you're doing a little neg on her， But here it's just so tender， It's so tender and soft。

 And the best thing you know what I love， I'm like a cinder， I love this。

 And you then take your mouth， And put it right here on her， And you suck on it。

 And you can do that in public， You can go get away with it， I love that， I love that， Alright。

 get off me， Isn't that nice？， So I guess we'd call that biting， You could also say to the girl。

 By my neck， Right here， And if she does， Oh， fuck， come here， Or you could say， No， no， no， no， no。

 You did all wrong， come here， Like this， And bite her neck， Try it again， Hair pulling。

 You can do this in the club too， You can say you can thank your ancestors for this feeling。

 And they go， what do you mean？， Well， you know， little cats， little kittens。

 You can grab them by the scruff of the neck， And paralyze， we'll feel this， Here。

 put your head down， feel this， And you scratch the back of her neck， Grab a clump of her hair。

 the base of it， And then pull， I've had a girl do that to me， And I was like， fuck， hurts。

 Don't yank， yeah， Just pull， As you go， mmm， It's not fucking good， do that to me， If you can't。

 I don't know if I'm not all of you can do it， Yeah， if you have no problem with it。

 And they grab the back of your hair， Or if you can't， because your hair is shorter。

 You can say you want to hear one of the things I really miss about not having long hair anymore。

 Right？， Feel this， Mmm， that's not gorgeous， I wish you could do it to me， but you can't， You lose。

 What a hair pulling， How about， here's a good one， Tongue sucking， Where you say to the girl。

 I could have said to that girl yesterday the one that I made out with， I could have said， come here。

 stick your tongue out， Because it， what？， Just go like that， stick your tongue out， good girl。

 Suck under tongue， You can do it in the club， And then of course that's pretty much all you'd want to do。

 Yeah， then you go， then you go， you know what？， I am so fucking attracted to you。

 let's slow this down， come on， let's rejoin our friends， Come on， arm and arm， Hey。

 we like each other， you guys go with that？， And then I shoot the shit with the friends。

 because I know I'm already in， All I gotta do is build comfort and wait six hours， You know。

 babysitter for a little while， Tongue sucking， what else do we got？， Kissing， Kissing， good one。

 Frenching， Right？， French kissing， Also known as making out， And that's pretty much it。

 because anything beyond that if you start grabbing a breasts， That's for play， With the purpose。

 with the intent of arousal， sexual arousal， This is all comfort building。

 this is all to build comfort， Isn't that odd to think that making out， you know。

 making out can arouse you， There's no doubt， that's the one that's make a break。

 Where when kissing turns into four-play， when you start really heavy-duty making out。

 You let her calm it down， okay？， So you can kiss her， kiss her， it's this connection feel， Okay。

 that's what you're trying to build， and when you start tongueing each other， You go， you know what。

 baby， we gotta slow this down， And you're the one saying slow it down， I mean， what a crack。

 you know， this is cracks we up， But if you're the one who does that， You know。

 she's gonna be encouraged to jump out of the pool， go into the world pool， come chase you， Alright。

 so， okay， that's off the top of my head， One， two， three， four， five， six， seven， eight， nine， ten。

 Frenching that's ten right there off the top of my head， Now， there's no。

 and we can go further of course， because Kino escalation goes all the way to last minute resistance to grabbing breasts。

 But you don't wanna grab it， okay？ You don't wanna put your hand over it， And keep moving。

 because if you grab it， she can tell you to stop， But if you just go over it， with intent， you know。

 I can look at her breasts， And I can， you know， grab her neck and rub my hands over her breasts。

 You know， and then say， okay， we better slow this down， come on， You can do that。

 you can do that in field， What else do I wanna talk about？， So。

 the reduction tactics as this escalates to last minute resistance stuff， that's all reduction。

 We're gonna deal with seduction tomorrow， okay？， I'm gonna devote some time to it in fact。

 But you get the main idea of how comfort， what constitutes comfort escalation， okay？。

 Or Kino escalation， Every single step， she has to feel comfortable doing with you。

 If she's uncomfortable， you shut it off， And you wait for her to bring back something into the conversation。

 You're gonna do one of two things， you'll either shut up completely and wait for her to re-initiate the chat。

 But what if she doesn't？ Then you'll re-initiate the chat， but it won't be Kino escalation。

 It'll just be the next story， ever been to the Hollywood sign？， You think， you know。

 you're off to your next routine， So now that you get an idea of this， notice which ones exist。

 Every single one of these is a tactic， a specific routine， Like kissing。

 we've got the tic-tac routine， Remember that one？， Tic-tac routine， In fact。

 I was ready to use the tic-tac routine on the black little black girl。

 And because I went for the kiss and I just was playing incorrectly for a workshop。

 That's how I feel， that's being honest， So I took my tic-tacs， I couldn't find them。

 I was looking all over for them， Because I have many things in my pocket， stupid， So I took them up。

 put them in an empty pocket， so I'm ready to go， So I can go and do the tic-tac thing。

 It's so subtle and it works so well， Tic-tac routine for kissing， Hair pulling is a routine。

 You can thank your ancestors for this， what do you mean？， Well。

 your brain is a magnificent machine designed by millions of generations of success stories。

 Your emotional circuitry is almost fucking perfect。

 The ancestor you had that got too close to the edge of the cliff and didn't feel fear and jumped off。

 Well， guess what？ He's not a part of your ancestor， is he？， He's dead。

 Only the people who were afraid for good reason are the ones that are still alive， And therefore。

 when you feel fear for heights， don't think you're crazy。

 Some people think they're crazy for the emotions they feel。

 And yet the emotions were given to them by their ancestors。

 You are the reason your ancestors ever existed at all， You should thank them for your emotions。

 Instead of looking outward for the signs of what you should do best to further your life。

 And do the right things in life， You should look inward and trust your instincts。

 trust your emotions， Like for instance， how do you know you're attracted to a man？。

 And then I'm off into my next routine by the way， That routine is a part of evolution phase shift。

 When style bites here， Style and I have been putting more pieces into this routine。

 It's turned into like a 10 minute routine， It's called evolution phase shift， Now。

 the responsibility of education lies in the student and not the teacher。

 We don't have time to go into the evolution phase shift routine because it's quite advanced。

 When you're ready for it， it's your responsibility to find it in the lounge， Okay。

 all you gotta do is read it， it's just there， And then incorporate it into your game。

 You get a vibe for how I roll， how I work， You saw it on the video clip， the pacing， the timing。

 the moves necessary， Evolution phase shift is the same thing。

 Where you get to talk to her about the brain being magnificent， a magnificent machine。

 Talking about her emotions， I then go on and I say to her， shut your brain off。

 trust your instincts， trust your emotions， Sometimes all you have to do is shut the fuck up。

 For instance， feel this， here， come close， good girl， Bend your head towards me， good。

 now feel this， you can thank your ancestors for this feeling， Oh， it's not fucking gorgeous。

 I love that， do that to me， God damn it， You know， I'm gonna bite you， not hard。

 but I am gonna bite you， No， not now， you won't know when。

 And the next thing we're going to smelly are going， I'm trying so hard not to kiss you right now。

 God damn it， Okay， enough of that， where were we？， Oh yeah， Hollywood sign， Okay， get this。

 My friend and I， we went to the Hollywood sign， we had to jump over this fence。

 And we're climbing up the top of the hill， so I'm off into my next routine， See how that works？。

 That's how I'd love to see you guys stitching this together， Alright。

 when you're not doing one of these， you're being normal， Then you make a move。

 then you take it away， push it away， and continue a normal routine， Look at these ones。

 this is what you have to do， specifically these ones， Not necessarily in this order。

 because there is no particular order， That's why I say， you know， between eight and twelve moves。

 Some of these moves， you don't have to do biting， you can go from smelling the hair point。

 You know what I mean？， These are the main moves， but there's only so many things you can do to quinoescalate。

 These are pretty much it， So the organic question， Yeah， can you hand this？。

 And if they don't give it， right？， It will hausus， if they give it， but it's real tense。

 I can just say， I never mind， And then go， ah fuck it， okay， come here， try again。

 It'll be better the second time， Now we need some guises。

 in case it really is uncomfortable for them， If they put their hands up like this， they're not。

 that's an IOD indicator of disinterest， If they put their hands up like this， and I lower my hands。

 and they just lower their hands with you， That's good， that's an IOI， right？。

 Not only is that a quinoescalation， on my part， it's also a quino test。

 I'm giving her an indicator of interest， right？， By doing this， is she receiving the IOI？。

 Is this a positive response to this quino test？， That's quinoescalation， What do you say？， Nothing。

 I don't talk about it， Yeah， you just take your hands lower as you're talking about something else。

 in the middle of a conversation， You know， I could hold my hand out and say。

 have you ever seen the movie pulled her guys？， You think it's based on reality or fiction？。

 I don't mean Caroline's stuck in the TV， You see， I'm talking about something totally different while I'm doing the quinoescalation。

 Now， in workshops， I would teach quinoescalation in set， In other words。

 I assume I'm going to blow up the set and wreck it by saying， you know， hey， you know， student。

 come over here， check this out， Okay， by holding her， give me your hands for a sec。

 and she gives the hands， notice that by lowering her hands， I can tell whether she's， you know。

 where her interest level lies， and I could talk about it， In front of the student。

 thinking to myself， I'd blow myself out of set， Well。

 it turned out I would never blow myself into set because it was interesting。

 Even though I'm talking about it， teaching somebody about it， teaching somebody about it， yes。

 The woman would be interested nonetheless， So that became the trust， sorry， the quinoescalation。

 What do they call it？， The trust test， It became the trust test， Personally。

 the silent quino test is far superior， but the trust test is pretty cool because you get to talk about it。

 you know， and it works as well， So it's your choice。

 it's just a little modification of the same thing， What point do you ask for the hands？。

 I want quino in the first minute and a half， So， if I'll hold my hand out like this even。

 just to see what they do， because if they， you know， just what does he want， put the hand in。

 Then I can start lowering， yeah， it's an NA2， I have to see， I have to get IOIs in a2， right？。

 Before I move on to A3， so I have to test for these IOIs， So that's why I do an NA2。

 When someone next to you， they touch you and you say hands off， hands off。

 what if they touch you again？， You don't keep going hands off， hands off， They touch you， okay。

 you used to， don't make it too much of a big deal， don't go hands off， man。

 I said hands fuck it off， The idea is you wanted to put the hands on， right？。

 And you want to pretend like it's no baby， but at first you want to use this as your opportunity to show her that。

 hey， you need to win me over， Sometimes if I can't get some sort of hand holding， I make。

 because she's sitting next to me， right？， I don't have to turn and hold her hands。

 I'll just take her arm， I didn't do hand holding with the blonde， My first move was an arm and arm。

 Savoy went with her friend and asked me to run interference， That's why I was working the blonde。

 He wanted to run off with his girl， So as he ran off with his girl。

 I just went next to her and I went， good， and I kept my hand on top。

 Because I knew it was going to pull away， I felt it， I just kept it on top。

 got her used to me for a little bit， Yeah， you have to get her body used to you， you know。

 and that's all you get， don't get any ideas， Yeah， exactly， exactly， So， alright。

 so there you have that， Kino Escalation， I'd like to see some of that tonight。

 Did you do arm and arm， and definitely you should be doing when you're moving with her？， No。

 I don't like arm and arm when you're moving， I like having two girls arm and arm when I'm moving。

 You know， it's like， come on， let's do it for me， good， You know。

 there are so many women in this room that are jealous of you two right now。

 And that's my little one-liner piece that I use when I am running the rail， You know。

 the rail is when you， it's just got to walk 20 feet with two girls in your arm， You know， hey。

 let's find my friends， I can't find my friends， oh well， we'll find them later， Right。

 but during those 20 feet that you walked with the rail。

 I'd love to see some of you guys running the rail tonight， So。

 your two beautiful girls in your arm as you walk around， and as you do。

 you can eyeball every woman at that point， Okay， eyeball every guy， So， so， so， so， so， so， so， so。

 so， so， so， so， so， so， so， so， so， so， so， okay？。

 These girls do not care very much about your looks， they think they do。

 I just keep them like that， or when I'm running away from you， you know。

 I won't get those white marks here and here， that's a little story， so anyway you get the idea of。

 avatar， let's move on， so like when people ask me， what do I do。

 I'll say I'll get to that in a second， I'm going to show you something really cool， it's related。

 I'll tell you why in a moment， this is something I've been thinking about。

 I thought it's really curious， and then I do 3。14159， and they go what are you。

 mathematician or something， I'm like no don't you get it？， Destiny， everything happens for a reason。

 and it serves us， have you ever heard of， Nostradamus， okay get this。

 this guy was around in the 1650s， and now I can start talking about， Nostradamus for 5 minutes。

 and the next thing you know， I'm often to showing them， that I've got fucking ESP。

 and I can predict the future， and all this sort of nonsense， and they get drawn in。

 and then I say well I actually do， like they go wow， you're amazing， what do you do？。

 I actually do stage shows， like I show people， you know， that the laws of physics。

 are really amazing， you know， illusion or not， magic is real， so I got all my sound bites。

 all together for all this right？， I can reveal to them who I am， and I'm doing it really soon。

 you have to do it really soon， they should know your identity， or at least a taste of your identity。

 I believe in the first， a minute and a half to three minutes， every single set ultimately。

 should know who you are， a man can pull out a hundred bucks。

 flip it and put it into his other pocket， another man can say he's a marketer。

 the woman is going to go for the guy， who has a hundred bucks。

 over the guy who says he's a fucking marketer， because marketer means money， okay。

 and a hundred bucks means I take care of myself， physical reality， and symbols are much stronger。

 than actual things， like you know， I could put a gold card out， sure that's fine。

 or I can have a lot of cash， with a money clip， in the shape of money。

 that is going to be more responsive， it's a way of conveying。

 confidence and conveying certain aspects of my personality， that I'm playful。

 just by my clothing alone， and I tell you， it really assists in opening， now it will make a break。

 peacock theory is what we call this， it won't make a break， you're not going to get laid。

 because you're dressing funny， but what it will do。

 is it will allow them to initiate the chat with you， in fact。

 I think every person should wear at least one interesting item， this is interesting enough。

 all women are always touching this， guys are always going， is that like a carpet。

 so they fuck with you， and then of course， you can go with it， instead of fighting them。

 you're basically going to have something better to say， because I mean， this now it's my coat。

 I know the answers to， everyone's little jokes， I've been socialized， I know answers to them all。

 actually this is from my great- my great-grandmother's couch， she's really pissed。

 she's sleeping on a spring right now， so you have something better to say， and you just go with it。

 and you're playful， but by doing that， I've now been able to demonstrate my personality。

 in front of that girl， who was just shutting up and watching， so all those guys that are coming up。

 and the new man， can they touch it？， dude man， I don't know where your hands have been， chill man。

 holy shit， you know， k-pars over there， you know， these are black nails， not pink。

 okay back off Cecil， and there I'm able to， convey that I've got。

 I've got alpha male characteristics， it's a demonstration， right in front of the girl。

 and that's what this stuff， allows you to do， also the very fact， that you're wearing this。

 somehow just triggers attraction in women， because they know that， you're going to be fucked with。

 from other guys， and that's peacock theory， you know， if you have this big， long cumbersome tail。

 and yet you're still healthy， it can still live， well then you must， be the best。

 so if you can go through the world， this is just a taste， I mean I go all out。

 I go crazier and crazier， more and more， nowadays， we also want to wear， chickbait。

 one interesting item， just something， none of you have it， an interesting item。

 like here's an example， that I thought was quite funny， you know that， that blonde girl。

 that you said， don't do it， right， well she knew， that I was a pickup artist， you told her。

 and I could feel the tension， from that， where they're like， one of them said。

 oh you're wearing that， in order to， get people to talk about it， right， conversation starter。

 and I already said to her， you know， you've already， pigeonholed me， something like that。

 you pigeonholed me， a certain way， based on what， you've been told， and yet， curiously。

 she still stayed， I did handholding stuff， we were finger holding， finger and finger， it stayed。

 it was on， when they were about to leave， right， I said it was nice meeting you。

 and she wouldn't leave， she was there for like， 20 seconds more， and it was just， she is。

 hoping I'll continue this， that's why I pulled her， aside and I said。

 I'm going to talk to your friend， for about two minutes， and then you can never back。

 and grabbed her by the hand， handkino was on， pulled her aside， and she just came right away。

 you know， even though she knew， I was a pickup artist， the very fact， this was so funny， about this。

 you tell a girl， that I'm a pickup artist， they put their defenses up， I throw nags， they feel like。

 I'm not hitting on them， so they try to win me over， ta-da， ta-da， I want to create， you know。

 an image of the way， I see her， so she can fill the role， I'll say， you know。

 what the hell are you doing in this club， you are way too， classy to be in this club。

 you're very classy， I can tell you the leader of your group， I like that。

 the reason why I want to throw those in， is because， what if， take away girl comes along。

 to go take her away， and then， she goes to the leader， is all I have to say。

 she wants to fill the role， so she'll stay， I also want it to be， classy， so that she doesn't start。

 playing stupid game， you know， just saying the word， classy， you're very classy。

 I like that about you， anyway， instead of fighting， against her， this way， what if you were to。

 instead， check this out， instead of going against her， she believes in God， and you don't。

 believe in God， instead， just go along with her， for now， because， all you have to do。

 is slowly turn， over the course of two weeks， and she will have to， turn with you， it is easier to。

 turn a person's， beliefs another way， this way， than to smash into it， isn't it easier。

 to have a woman， listen to what you have to say， if she's your girlfriend， and you're， in her。

 you're on the same side， of the fence， looking at the universe， questioning reality。

 rather than on opposite sides， and you're fighting her， you don't want to get， in an argument。

 with a girl， that you haven't had sex， with yet， because you're not going， to have sex， with her。

 normally you have the， opportunity， to debate， and change her views， if you want her views。

 to be changed， if you believe， you're right， I'm not out to， change anybody's beliefs，沒。

Yank，童哉，Yank，in，AK， Zhi，Yank，Yank，Z，Y，Yank，Z，Yank，Yank，我也協物業，，那是我採用的，待這個時間每一天，當時設計談，彭先生，和idents，維樂深圳。

心意圖，利點她流行， lisler and rehead，判案正在这个剧DPI的文达，这么多条件，我想观察，其实童ienza的假记中，正常办法，现在判案，下来，以去勒 rend，我一直在表明。

我站在 básicamente，野典 ag， org，国主，何故， favor，我要把你设施，真正的，反正你 answer，要变成你，董事长，疼，我 Aa，就是說，K，C，S，E，E，远，��는，3。

E，E，UN，PR，T，unt，E，rä，N， Hmmm，OK， obviously， there is no way for me to get that information out of your head。

， But what if there were certain patterns in nature that I could be aware of？， Three。， Yeah， see？。

 There are patterns in nature， and you can recognize these patterns over time，。

 and I have to stay one step ahead。， So basically what he does， he makes it less computer， jargon。

 and more nature jargon。， Because computers are ultimately nature， math is nature， code is nature。。

 I can go one step further， I'll tell you one more story。， A human being， you are not your material。。

 Just like Britney Spears' oops， I did it again， is not the CD。， It's the same song。

 whether it's in CD form， whether it's written in ones and zeros on a piece of paper，。

 whether it's on a hard drive and magnetic form， whether it's on a tape。。

 Doesn't matter what the medium is， the medium in which it is stored，， the song is not the media。。

 The song is the information， the actual coding。， The media is needed to store the information。。

 Because no media， you can't store it。， Or it could even be sound waves。， Hell。

 it could be light waves。， Shoot it out， the shoot， the oops， I did it again， out on a laser beam。。

 And there it is， shooting out， this laser beam， ones and zeros， on and off，。

 shooting out into space， and the oops， I did it again， is going out into space。， Radio waves。

 they're still going out。， Oops， I did it again， came out， what， 99 or something？， So that's been。

 you know， six years。， Six years， that's six light years away。。

 This information is leaving the earth。， It's already six light years away。， Well。

 here's what I find fascinating。， You are not your matter。。

 You are the pattern of the way the matter is put together。， In other words， the media is the matter。

， But if I take all this matter and I put it up in a blender and put it out，， that's no longer you。。

 Okay， you， your soul， your spirit， who you are， your identity，， is the way you're put together。。

 And we know that for a fact， because every seven years， all this material leaves，。

 and you shed your skin， you get new skin， seven years from now。， Hey man， your hair grows。。

 All the water is no longer， you know， in you。， Even a week later， you are renewed。

 and yet you're still you。， So it's not the media， but the pattern that makes you who you are。。

 In other words， what I'm trying to say to you is， you are a song。， Now。

 if only I could come up with a way of MP3ing you。， I'll work it out。。

 And so that's another one of the little pieces。， And it just fucks with their head， you know。

 bullshit baffles brains， right？， How could I compress you as a song？， Girls love this shit。

 because it's like， wow， you know。， You are a song。 And that story I start with。

 you know what I'm thinking about today？， You are a song。， What？ Okay， figure this out。。

 And then you go off into the story。， Use it as an opener today。。

 With in context of being a programmer， being an encryptor，， you can throw that piece in。

 and it becomes， he becomes nature oriented。， You know， where he says， math is nature。。

 It's understanding and recognizing patterns and nature。 That's all it is。。

 Girls have this issue that guys don't have， where it's really important to them not to look like a slut。

， not to feel like a slut， not to have their friends think they're a slut。， Something。

 we don't even care。 Like it doesn't even occur to us。

 but to them it's this crucially important thing。， And so if she goes out to the bar。

 and her friends see her kissing some new guy that she just met or whatever，， it'll give her this。

 oh no， they're going to think I'm a slut feeling。， You guys have probably never felt that feeling。

 but you don't care if your friends see you kiss some new girl。， You just don't care at all。。

 But for her， it's a strong feeling of avoidance that she wants to avoid。。

 I recommend going in for a lot of this stuff before you feel comfortable doing it。。

 Like don't wait for the perfect moment to try your kiss clothes。， Okay， instead。

 just make yourself a rule that， okay， if I'm 10 minutes in any set，。

 I'm going to go for the kiss and I'm going to do it a thousand times。， A thousand times is。

 for the five months， assuming you do four nights a week， 12 sets a night。。

 A lot of this stuff is calibration。， You just get this intuition。

 After you're in the field for a long time， you just get this feeling。。

 You know when you can go for the kiss。， You know when it's not ready yet。

 You know when you can say this and when you shouldn't say that。。

 You just get a real strong feel for it。 Okay， how are you going to get that feeling if you don't just go out and try it？

， If you go out and just try to kiss， you know， go into set。， It's some point go for the kiss。

 Go to the next set。 It's some point go for the kiss。， If you do that a hundred times。

 five hundred times a thousand times。， And what's going to happen is you're going to develop this feeling where you just know exactly when you can do it and when you can't。

， You will know you'll get this feeling。， You will not get that feeling if you don't go out and just do it。

， Just do it a bunch of times。， That feeling is not going to come until after you do the work。。

 So what you'll discover after you do it a bunch of times is it'll become clear to you that you can actually get away with it a lot sooner than you ever thought was possible。

， Makeouts are actually really easy。， I would recommend that for the first six months or so。

 just go out and try and get as many makeouts as you can just so you can develop your calibration。。

 And then at some point you're going to find out that making out is not solid game。。

 Girls go out and make out with different guys all the time。， All the time。 It's fun for them。

 It's like no big deal。， And so， and it's funny for a guy who's especially a guy who's new to the bar scene。

， He might see some girl and he's talking to her and things seem to be going pretty good。， And wow。

 these things are going pretty good with this girl。， Five minutes later。

 he sees her making out with some guy and he doesn't get it。， It's like， what the fuck？。

 What happened？ Did she not like me or whatever？， Because for her， it's no big deal。

 She'll just make out with a guy。， You know， I've been talking to girls before and the one I'm talking to and her friends say。

 oh， we have to go now and she'll look at me and I'll say， oh。

 it's too bad you guys have to go and she go， I'll make out with you if you want to。， But okay。

 I make out there。 I've done that on Broadway before。， Yeah。

 at first you just want to be able to do it。 Just go out and try it a bunch of times until you can consistently get makeouts。

， This is one of those things that does not get you laid。

 but it really impresses people who don't understand。， All your friends will be like， oh， my god。

 did you see that？ He made out with that chick。， And the truth is they don't know that you just fucked up your chances of having sex with her。

， But to them， it's all impressive， right？， A2。， Why is it fucked up with sex with having sex with her？

， What a good question。， In order to have sex with a girl， you have to have attraction， which is A2。

 you have to have A3， which is qualification。， You have to have comfort。。

 And usually comfort involves a bunch of venue changes and seven hours together。。

 But to just to make out with a girl， you can do that within the first five or ten minutes。。

 It's really easy。 It's amazingly easy。 Try it a thousand times。。

 Pretty soon you'll have a good skill for it。， You can go in and talk to a girl and basically pump up her emotions and get her all giggly。

， Do a false disqualifier going for the kiss。， And you can make out with her。， The next day。

 she's not going to return your phone calls。， You're just some guy that she talked to for five minutes and kissed on。

， She was drunk。 It doesn't count。， So what happens when the guy calls？， Hey。

 you want to get together？ Have some dinner？， She's going to think， well。

 I was already making out with him。 I don't even know this guy。， The next thing is sex。。

 She'll get this weird， uncomfortable feeling and she'll avoid it。。

 At the time that she gives you her phone number， she may even think，， oh， this guy's cool。

 I'd like to see him some time。 I'll give him my number。， But the next day。

 she's not in that emotional state anymore。， She's not feeling that anymore。

 She's feeling something different。， And this guy calls her up。

 Some guy she doesn't really even know。， And he wants to hang out。

 She knows he just won't have sex with her。， But she doesn't feel comfortable with him。

 She doesn't feel a connection with him。， She doesn't feel qualified by him。 No， no。

 those elements are there。， And so she happens to not return your call。， Or she says， oh。

 can you call me back in five minutes？， And then she doesn't pick up the phone。。

 Or she just never picks up the phone in the first place。， Because it's just some number。

 She gets all kinds of those。， And then she never calls it back and that's that。， Hey。

 we met it on Broadway last night。， Beep。 And that's that。。

 There's too many other guys that didn't come along today。。

 And tomorrow that are fun and exciting and cool。， And that she has a good time with why are you going to go chase you down？
